2:1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.   
2:2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;   
2:3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:   
2:4 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?   
2:5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?   
  
2:6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?   
2:7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?   
2:8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:   
2:9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.   
2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.   
  
2:11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.   
2:12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.   
2:13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.   
2:14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?   
2:15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,   
  
2:16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?   
2:17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.   
2:18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.   
2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.   
2:20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?   
  
2:21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?   
2:22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?   
2:23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.   
2:24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.   
2:25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?   
  
2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

2:1 我的弟兄们、你们信奉我们荣耀的主耶稣基督、便不可按着外貌待人。  
2:2 若有一个人带着金戒指、穿着华美衣服、进你们的会堂去。又有一个穷人、穿着肮脏衣服也进去。  
2:3 你们就重看那穿华美衣服的人、说、请坐在这好位上。又对那穷人说、你站在那里、或坐在我脚凳下边。  
2:4 这岂不是你们偏心待人、用恶意断定人么。  
2:5 我亲爱的弟兄们请听、　神岂不是拣选了世上的贫穷人、叫他们在信上富足、并承受他所应许给那些爱他之人的国么。  

2:6 你们反倒羞辱贫穷人。那富足人岂不是欺压你们、拉你们到公堂去么。  
2:7 他们不是亵渎你们所敬奉的尊名么。〔所敬奉或作被称〕
2:8 经上记着说、『要爱人如己。』你们若全守这至尊的律法才是好的。  
2:9 但你们若按外貌待人、便是犯罪、被律法定为犯法的。  
2:10 因为凡遵守全律法的、只在一条上跌倒、他就是犯了众条。  

2:11 原来那说不可奸淫的、也说不可杀人。你就是不奸淫、却杀人、仍是成了犯律法的。  
2:12 你们既然要按使人自由的律法受审判、就该照这律法说话行事。  
2:13 因为那不怜悯人的、也要受无怜悯的审判。怜悯原是向审判夸胜。  
2:14 我的弟兄们、若有人说、自己有信心、却没有行为、有甚么益处呢。这信心能救他么。  
2:15 若是弟兄、或是姐妹、赤身露体、又缺了日用的饮食、

2:16 你们中间有人对他们说、平平安安的去吧、愿你们穿得暖吃得饱。却不给他们身体所需用的、这有甚么益处呢。  
2:17 这样、信心若没有行为就是死的。  
2:18 必有人说、你有信心、我有行为。你将你没有行为的信心指给我看、我便借着我的行为、将我的信心指给你看。  
2:19 你信　神只有一位、你信的不错。鬼魔也信、却是战惊。  
2:20 虚浮的人哪、你愿意知道没有行为的信心是死的么。  

2:21 我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕、把他儿子以撒献在坛上、岂不是因行为称义么。  
2:22 可见信心是与他的行为并行、而且信心因着行为才得成全。  
2:23 这就应验经上所说、『亚伯拉罕信　神、这就算为他的义。』他又得称为　神的朋友。  
2:24 这样看来、人称义是因着行为、不是单因着信。  
2:25 妓女喇合接待使者、又放他们从别的路上出去、不也是一样因行为称义么。  

2:26 身体没有灵魂是死的、信心没有行为也是死的。
