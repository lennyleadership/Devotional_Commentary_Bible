1:1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.   
1:2 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;   
1:3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.   
1:4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.   
1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.   
  
1:6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.   
1:7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.   
1:8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.   
1:9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:   
1:10 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.   
  
1:11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.   
1:12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.   
1:13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:   
1:14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.   
1:15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.   
  
1:16 Do not err, my beloved brethren.   
1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.   
1:18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be <a class = "blue">a kind of firstfruits of his creatures</a>.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Firstfruits: 1 Corinthians 15:20 NKJV<br><br>But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.<br><br>[2024.08]Winston had asked a question: why Jesus was resurrected on the third day, not the second day or the forth day.<br><br>In the books of New Testament, Jesus disciples often refer Him to the Passover lamb and the firstfruits.  One of the reasons is that Jesus was crucified on the Passover (Friday), and was resurrected on the Feast of Firstfruits (Sunday).<br><br>God setup the Passover and the feast of Firstfruits, but most of Israel people observed them as custom.  They knew little of their meaning, they knew nothing that these feasts were pointed to Jesus.
</span>   
1:19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:   
1:20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.   
  
1:21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.   
1:22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.   
1:23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:   
1:24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.   
1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.   
  
1:26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.   
1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

1:1 作　神和主耶稣基督仆人的雅各、请散住十二个支派之人的安。  
1:2 我的弟兄们、你们落在百般试炼中、都要以为大喜乐。  
1:3 因为知道你们的信心经过试验、就生忍耐。  
1:4 但忍耐也当成功、使你们成全完备、毫无缺欠。  
1:5 你们中间若有缺少智慧的、应当求那厚赐与众人、也不斥责人的　神、主就必赐给他。  

1:6 只要凭着信心求、一点不疑惑。因为那疑惑的人、就像海中的波浪、被风吹动翻腾。  
1:7 这样的人、不要想从主那里得甚么。  
1:8 心怀二意的人、在他一切所行的路上、都没有定见。  
1:9 卑微的弟兄升高、就该喜乐。  
1:10 富足的降卑、也该如此。因为他必要过去、如同草上的花一样。  

1:11 太阳出来、热风刮起、草就枯干、花也凋谢、美容就消没了。那富足的人、在他所行的事上、也要这样衰残。  
1:12 忍受试探的人是有福的。因为他经过试验以后、必得生命的冠冕、这是主应许给那些爱他之人的。  
1:13 人被试探、不可说、我是被　神试探。因为　神不能被恶试探、他也不试探人。  
1:14 但各人被试探、乃是被自己的私欲牵引诱惑的。  
1:15 私欲既怀了胎、就生出罪来。罪既长成、就生出死来。  

1:16 我亲爱的弟兄们、不要看错了。  
1:17 各样美善的恩赐、和各样全备的赏赐、都是从上头来的。从众光之父那里降下来的。在他并没有改变、也没有转动的影儿。  
1:18 他按自己的旨意、用真道生了我们、叫我们在他所造的万物中、好像初熟的果子。  
1:19 我亲爱的弟兄们、这是你们所知道的。但你们各人要快快的听、慢慢的说、慢慢的动怒。  
1:20 因为人的怒气、并不成就　神的义。  

1:21 所以你们要脱去一切的污秽、和盈余的邪恶、存温柔的心领受那所栽种的道、就是能救你们灵魂的道。  
1:22 只是你们要行道、不要单单听道、自己欺哄自己。  
1:23 因为听道而不行道的、就像人对着镜子看自己本来的面目。  
1:24 看见、走后、随即忘了他的相貌如何。  
1:25 惟有详细察看那全备使人自由之律法的、并且时常如此、这人既不是听了就忘、乃是实在行出来、就在他所行的事上必然得福。  

1:26 若有人自以为虔诚、却不勒住他的舌头、反欺哄自己的心、这人的虔诚是虚的。  
1:27 在　神我们的父面前、那清洁没有玷污的虔诚、就是看顾在患难中的孤儿寡妇、并且保守自己不沾染世俗。
