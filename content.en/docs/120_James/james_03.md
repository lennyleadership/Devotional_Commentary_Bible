3:1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.   
3:2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.   
3:3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.   
3:4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.   
3:5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!   
  
3:6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.   
3:7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:   
3:8 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.   
3:9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.   
3:10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.   
  
3:11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?   
3:12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.   
3:13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.   
3:14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.   
3:15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.   
  
3:16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.   
3:17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.   
3:18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.

3:1 我的弟兄们、不要多人作师傅、因为晓得我们要受更重的判断。  
3:2 原来我们在许多事上都有过失。若有人在话语上没有过失、他就是完全人、也能勒住自己的全身。  
3:3 我们若把嚼环放在马嘴里、叫他顺服、就能调动他的全身。  
3:4 看哪、船只虽然甚大、又被大风催逼、只用小小的舵、就随着掌舵的意思转动。  
3:5 这样、舌头在百体里也是最小的、却能说大话。看哪、最小的火、能点着最大的树林。  

3:6 舌头就是火、在我们百体中、舌头是个罪恶的世界、能污秽全身、也能把生命的轮子点起来。并且是从地狱里点着的。  
3:7 各类的走兽、飞禽、昆虫、水族、本来都可以制伏、也已经被人制伏了。  
3:8 惟独舌头没有人能制伏、是不止息的恶物。满了害死人的毒气。  
3:9 我们用舌头颂赞那为主为父的、又用舌头咒诅那照着　神形像被造的人。  
3:10 颂赞和咒诅从一个口里出来、我的弟兄们、这是不应当的。  

3:11 泉源从一个眼里能发出甜苦两样的水么。  
3:12 我的弟兄们、无花果树能生橄榄么、葡萄树能结无花果么。咸水里也不能发出甜水来。  
3:13 你们中间谁是有智慧有见识的呢。他就当在智慧的温柔上、显出他的善行来。  
3:14 你们心里若怀着苦毒的嫉妒和分争、就不可自夸、也不可说谎话抵挡真道。  
3:15 这样的智慧、不是从上头来的、乃是属地的、属情欲的、属鬼魔的。  

3:16 在何处有嫉妒分争、就在何处有扰乱、和各样的坏事。  
3:17 惟独从上头来的智慧、先是清洁、后是和平、温良柔顺、满有怜悯、多结善果、没有偏见、没有假冒。  
3:18 并且使人和平的、是用和平所栽种的义果。
