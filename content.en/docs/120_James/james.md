James Chapter 1  <  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27    
1:1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.   
1:2 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;   
1:3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.   
1:4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.   
1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.   
  
1:6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.   
1:7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.   
1:8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.   
1:9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:   
1:10 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.   
  
1:11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.   
1:12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.   
1:13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:   
1:14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.   
1:15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.   
  
1:16 Do not err, my beloved brethren.   
1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.   
1:18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.   
1:19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:   
1:20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.   
  
1:21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.   
1:22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.   
1:23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:   
1:24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.   
1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.   
  
1:26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.   
1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

James Chapter 2  <  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26    
2:1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.   
2:2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;   
2:3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:   
2:4 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?   
2:5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?   
  
2:6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?   
2:7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?   
2:8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:   
2:9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.   
2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.   
  
2:11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.   
2:12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.   
2:13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.   
2:14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?   
2:15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,   
  
2:16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?   
2:17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.   
2:18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.   
2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.   
2:20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?   
  
2:21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?   
2:22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?   
2:23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.   
2:24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.   
2:25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?   
 
2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

James Chapter 3  <  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18    
3:1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.   
3:2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.   
3:3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.   
3:4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.   
3:5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!   
  
3:6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.   
3:7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:   
3:8 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.   
3:9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.   
3:10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.   
  
3:11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?   
3:12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.   
3:13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.   
3:14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.   
3:15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.   
  
3:16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.   
3:17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.   
3:18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.

James Chapter 4  <  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17    
4:1 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?   
4:2 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.   
4:3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.   
4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.   
4:5 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?   
  
4:6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.   
4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.   
4:8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.   
4:9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.   
4:10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.   
 
4:11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.   
4:12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?   
4:13 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:   
4:14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.   
4:15 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.   
 
4:16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.   
4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.

James Chapter 5  <  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20    
5:1 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.   
5:2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.   
5:3 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.   
5:4 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.   
5:5 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.   
 
5:6 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.   
5:7 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.   
5:8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.   
5:9 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.   
5:10 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.   
  
5:11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.   
5:12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.   
5:13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.   
5:14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:   
5:15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.   
 
5:16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.   
5:17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.   
5:18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.   
5:19 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;   
5:20 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.

雅各书 1章 

1:1 作　神和主耶稣基督仆人的雅各、请散住十二个支派之人的安。  
1:2 我的弟兄们、你们落在百般试炼中、都要以为大喜乐。  
1:3 因为知道你们的信心经过试验、就生忍耐。  
1:4 但忍耐也当成功、使你们成全完备、毫无缺欠。  
1:5 你们中间若有缺少智慧的、应当求那厚赐与众人、也不斥责人的　神、主就必赐给他。  

1:6 只要凭着信心求、一点不疑惑。因为那疑惑的人、就像海中的波浪、被风吹动翻腾。  
1:7 这样的人、不要想从主那里得甚么。  
1:8 心怀二意的人、在他一切所行的路上、都没有定见。  
1:9 卑微的弟兄升高、就该喜乐。  
1:10 富足的降卑、也该如此。因为他必要过去、如同草上的花一样。  

1:11 太阳出来、热风刮起、草就枯干、花也凋谢、美容就消没了。那富足的人、在他所行的事上、也要这样衰残。  
1:12 忍受试探的人是有福的。因为他经过试验以后、必得生命的冠冕、这是主应许给那些爱他之人的。  
1:13 人被试探、不可说、我是被　神试探。因为　神不能被恶试探、他也不试探人。  
1:14 但各人被试探、乃是被自己的私欲牵引诱惑的。  
1:15 私欲既怀了胎、就生出罪来。罪既长成、就生出死来。  

1:16 我亲爱的弟兄们、不要看错了。  
1:17 各样美善的恩赐、和各样全备的赏赐、都是从上头来的。从众光之父那里降下来的。在他并没有改变、也没有转动的影儿。  
1:18 他按自己的旨意、用真道生了我们、叫我们在他所造的万物中、好像初熟的果子。  
1:19 我亲爱的弟兄们、这是你们所知道的。但你们各人要快快的听、慢慢的说、慢慢的动怒。  
1:20 因为人的怒气、并不成就　神的义。  

1:21 所以你们要脱去一切的污秽、和盈余的邪恶、存温柔的心领受那所栽种的道、就是能救你们灵魂的道。  
1:22 只是你们要行道、不要单单听道、自己欺哄自己。  
1:23 因为听道而不行道的、就像人对着镜子看自己本来的面目。  
1:24 看见、走后、随即忘了他的相貌如何。  
1:25 惟有详细察看那全备使人自由之律法的、并且时常如此、这人既不是听了就忘、乃是实在行出来、就在他所行的事上必然得福。  

1:26 若有人自以为虔诚、却不勒住他的舌头、反欺哄自己的心、这人的虔诚是虚的。  
1:27 在　神我们的父面前、那清洁没有玷污的虔诚、就是看顾在患难中的孤儿寡妇、并且保守自己不沾染世俗。  


雅各书 2章  

2:1 我的弟兄们、你们信奉我们荣耀的主耶稣基督、便不可按着外貌待人。  
2:2 若有一个人带着金戒指、穿着华美衣服、进你们的会堂去。又有一个穷人、穿着肮脏衣服也进去。  
2:3 你们就重看那穿华美衣服的人、说、请坐在这好位上。又对那穷人说、你站在那里、或坐在我脚凳下边。  
2:4 这岂不是你们偏心待人、用恶意断定人么。  
2:5 我亲爱的弟兄们请听、　神岂不是拣选了世上的贫穷人、叫他们在信上富足、并承受他所应许给那些爱他之人的国么。  

2:6 你们反倒羞辱贫穷人。那富足人岂不是欺压你们、拉你们到公堂去么。  
2:7 他们不是亵渎你们所敬奉的尊名么。〔所敬奉或作被称〕
2:8 经上记着说、『要爱人如己。』你们若全守这至尊的律法才是好的。  
2:9 但你们若按外貌待人、便是犯罪、被律法定为犯法的。  
2:10 因为凡遵守全律法的、只在一条上跌倒、他就是犯了众条。  

2:11 原来那说不可奸淫的、也说不可杀人。你就是不奸淫、却杀人、仍是成了犯律法的。  
2:12 你们既然要按使人自由的律法受审判、就该照这律法说话行事。  
2:13 因为那不怜悯人的、也要受无怜悯的审判。怜悯原是向审判夸胜。  
2:14 我的弟兄们、若有人说、自己有信心、却没有行为、有甚么益处呢。这信心能救他么。  
2:15 若是弟兄、或是姐妹、赤身露体、又缺了日用的饮食、

2:16 你们中间有人对他们说、平平安安的去吧、愿你们穿得暖吃得饱。却不给他们身体所需用的、这有甚么益处呢。  
2:17 这样、信心若没有行为就是死的。  
2:18 必有人说、你有信心、我有行为。你将你没有行为的信心指给我看、我便借着我的行为、将我的信心指给你看。  
2:19 你信　神只有一位、你信的不错。鬼魔也信、却是战惊。  
2:20 虚浮的人哪、你愿意知道没有行为的信心是死的么。  

2:21 我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕、把他儿子以撒献在坛上、岂不是因行为称义么。  
2:22 可见信心是与他的行为并行、而且信心因着行为才得成全。  
2:23 这就应验经上所说、『亚伯拉罕信　神、这就算为他的义。』他又得称为　神的朋友。  
2:24 这样看来、人称义是因着行为、不是单因着信。  
2:25 妓女喇合接待使者、又放他们从别的路上出去、不也是一样因行为称义么。  

2:26 身体没有灵魂是死的、信心没有行为也是死的。  


雅各书 3章  


3:1 我的弟兄们、不要多人作师傅、因为晓得我们要受更重的判断。  
3:2 原来我们在许多事上都有过失。若有人在话语上没有过失、他就是完全人、也能勒住自己的全身。  
3:3 我们若把嚼环放在马嘴里、叫他顺服、就能调动他的全身。  
3:4 看哪、船只虽然甚大、又被大风催逼、只用小小的舵、就随着掌舵的意思转动。  
3:5 这样、舌头在百体里也是最小的、却能说大话。看哪、最小的火、能点着最大的树林。  

3:6 舌头就是火、在我们百体中、舌头是个罪恶的世界、能污秽全身、也能把生命的轮子点起来。并且是从地狱里点着的。  
3:7 各类的走兽、飞禽、昆虫、水族、本来都可以制伏、也已经被人制伏了。  
3:8 惟独舌头没有人能制伏、是不止息的恶物。满了害死人的毒气。  
3:9 我们用舌头颂赞那为主为父的、又用舌头咒诅那照着　神形像被造的人。  
3:10 颂赞和咒诅从一个口里出来、我的弟兄们、这是不应当的。  

3:11 泉源从一个眼里能发出甜苦两样的水么。  
3:12 我的弟兄们、无花果树能生橄榄么、葡萄树能结无花果么。咸水里也不能发出甜水来。  
3:13 你们中间谁是有智慧有见识的呢。他就当在智慧的温柔上、显出他的善行来。  
3:14 你们心里若怀着苦毒的嫉妒和分争、就不可自夸、也不可说谎话抵挡真道。  
3:15 这样的智慧、不是从上头来的、乃是属地的、属情欲的、属鬼魔的。  

3:16 在何处有嫉妒分争、就在何处有扰乱、和各样的坏事。  
3:17 惟独从上头来的智慧、先是清洁、后是和平、温良柔顺、满有怜悯、多结善果、没有偏见、没有假冒。  
3:18 并且使人和平的、是用和平所栽种的义果。  


雅各书 4章 

4:1 你们中间的争战斗殴、是从那里来的呢。不是从你们百体中战斗之私欲来的么。  
4:2 你们贪恋、还是得不着。你们杀害嫉妒、又斗殴争战、也不能得。你们得不着、是因为你们不求。  
4:3 你们求也得不着、是因为你们妄求、要浪费在你们的宴乐中。  
4:4 你们这些淫乱的人哪、〔淫乱的人原文作淫妇〕岂不知与世俗为友、就是与　神为敌么。所以凡想要与世俗为友的、就是与　神为敌了。  
4:5 你们想经上所说是徒然的么。　神所赐住在我们里面的灵、是恋爱至于嫉妒么。  

4:6 但他赐更多的恩典。所以经上说、『　神阻挡骄傲的人、赐恩给谦卑的人。』
4:7 故此你们要顺服　神。务要抵挡魔鬼、魔鬼就必离开你们逃跑了。  
4:8 你们亲近　神、　神就必亲近你们。有罪的人哪、要洁净你们的手。心怀二意的人哪、要清洁你们的心。  
4:9 你们要愁苦、悲哀、哭泣。将喜笑变作悲哀、欢乐变作愁闷。  
4:10 务要在主面前自卑、主就必叫你们升高。  

4:11 弟兄们、你们不可彼此批评。人若批评弟兄、论断弟兄、就是批评律法、论断律法。你若论断律法、就不是遵行律法、乃是判断人的。  
4:12 设立律法和判断人的、只有一位、就是那能救人也能灭人的。你是谁、竟敢论断别人呢。  
4:13 嗐、你们有话说、今天明天我们要往某城里去、在那里住一年、作买卖得利。  
4:14 其实明天如何、你们还不知道。你们的生命是甚么呢。你们原来是一片云雾、出现少时就不见了。  
4:15 你们只当说、主若愿意、我们就可以活着、也可以作这事、或作那事。  

4:16 现今你们竟以张狂夸口。凡这样夸口都是恶的。  
4:17 人若知道行善、却不去行、这就是他的罪了。  


雅各书 5章 
5:1 嗐、你们这些富足人哪、应当哭泣、号咷、因为将有苦难临到你们身上。  
5:2 你们的财物坏了、衣服也被虫子咬了。  
5:3 你们的金银都长了锈。那锈要证明你们的不是、又要吃你们的肉、如同火烧。你们在这末世、只知积攒钱财。  
5:4 工人给你们收割庄稼、你们亏欠他们的工钱。这工钱有声音呼叫。并且那收割之人的冤声、已经入了万军之主的耳了。  
5:5 你们在世上享美福、好宴乐、当宰杀的日子竟娇养你们的心。  

5:6 你们定了义人的罪、把他杀害、他也不抵挡你们。  
5:7 弟兄们哪、你们要忍耐、直到主来。看哪、农夫忍耐等候地里宝贵的出产、直到得了秋雨春雨。  
5:8 你们也当忍耐、坚固你们的心。因为主来的日子近了。  
5:9 弟兄们、你们不要彼此埋怨、免得受审判。看哪、审判的主站在门前了。  
5:10 弟兄们、你们要把那先前奉主名说话的众先知、当作能受苦能忍耐的榜样。  

5:11 那先前忍耐的人、我们称他们是有福的。你们听见过约伯的忍耐、也知道主给他的结局、明显主是满心怜悯、大有慈悲。  
5:12 我的弟兄们、最要紧的是不可起誓。不可指着天起誓、也不可指着地起誓、无论何誓都不可起。你们说话、是就说是、不是就说不是、免得你们落在审判之下。  
5:13 你们中间有受苦的呢、他就该祷告。有喜乐的呢、他就该歌颂。  
5:14 你们中间有病了的呢、他就该请教会的长老来。他们可以奉主的名用油抹他、为他祷告。  
5:15 出于信心的祈祷、要救那病人、主必叫他起来。他若犯了罪、也必蒙赦免。  

5:16 所以你们要彼此认罪、互相代求、使你们可以得医治。义人祈祷所发的力量、是大有功效的。  
5:17 以利亚与我们是一样性情的人、他恳切祷告、求不要下雨、雨就三年零六个月不下在地上。  
5:18 他又祷告、天就降下雨来、地也生出土产。  
5:19 我的弟兄们、你们中间若有失迷真道的、有人使他回转。  
5:20 这人该知道叫一个罪人从迷路上转回、便是救一个灵魂不死、并且遮盖许多的罪。
