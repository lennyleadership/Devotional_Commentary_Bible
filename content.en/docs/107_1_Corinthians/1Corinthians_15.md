15:1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand:  
15:2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  
15:3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures:  
15:4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  
15:5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:  

15:6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.  
15:7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.  
15:8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.  
15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.  
15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.  

15:11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.  
15:12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?  
15:13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:  
15:14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.  
15:15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.  

15:16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:  
15:17 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.  
15:18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.  
15:19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.  
15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.  

15:21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.  
15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.  
15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.  
15:24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.  
15:25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.  

15:26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.  
15:27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.  
15:28 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.  
15:29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?  
15:30 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?  

15:31 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.  
15:32 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.  
15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.  
15:34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.  
15:35 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?  

15:36 Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:  
15:37 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:  
15:38 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.  
15:39 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.  
15:40 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.  

15:41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.  
15:42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:  
15:43 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:  
15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.  
15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.  

15:46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.  
15:47 The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.  
15:48 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  
15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.  
15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.  

15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  
15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  
15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  
15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  
15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?  

15:56 The sting of death is sin; and <a style = "color: blue">the strength of sin is the law</a>.  
15:57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
15:58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

15:1 弟兄们、我如今把先前所传给你们的福音、告诉你们知道、这福音你们也领受了、又靠着站立得住。  
15:2 并且你们若不是徒然相信、能以持守我所传给你们的、就必因这福音得救。  
15:3 我当日所领受又传给你们的、第一、就是基督照圣经所说、为我们的罪死了。  
15:4 而且埋葬了。又照圣经所说、第三天复活了。  
15:5 并且显给矶法看。然后显给十二使徒看。  

15:6 后来一时显给五百多弟兄看、其中一大半到如今还在、却也有已经睡了的。  
15:7 以后显给雅各看。再显给众使徒看。  
15:8 末了也显给我看。我如同未到产期而生的人一般。  
15:9 我原是使徒中最小的、不配称为使徒、因为我从前逼迫　神的教会。  
15:10 然而我今日成了何等人、是蒙　神的恩才成的。并且他所赐我的恩、不是徒然的。我比众使徒格外劳苦。这原不是我、乃是　神的恩与我同在。  

15:11 不拘是我是众使徒、我们如此传、你们也如此信了。  
15:12 既传基督是从死里复活了、怎么在你们中间、有人说没有死人复活的事呢。  
15:13 若没有死人复活的事、基督也就没有复活了。  
15:14 若基督没有复活、我们所传的便是枉然、你们所信的也是枉然。  
15:15 并且明显我们是为　神妄作见证的。因我们见证　神是叫基督复活了。若死人真不复活、　神也就没有叫基督复活了。  

15:16 因为死人若不复活、基督也就没有复活了。  
15:17 基督若没有复活、你们的信便是徒然。你们仍在罪里。  
15:18 就是在基督里睡了的人也灭亡了。  
15:19 我们若靠基督、只在今生有指望、就算比众人更可怜。  
15:20 但基督已经从死里复活、成为睡了之人初熟的果子。  

15:21 死既是因一人而来、死人复活也是因一人而来。  
15:22 在亚当里众人都死了。照样、在基督里众人也都要复活。  
15:23 但各人是按着自己的次序复活。初熟的果子是基督。以后在他来的时候、是那些属基督的。  
15:24 再后末期到了、那时、基督既将一切执政的、掌权的、有能的、都毁灭了、就把国交与父　神。  
15:25 因为基督必要作王、等　神把一切仇敌、都放在他的脚下。  

15:26 尽末了所毁灭的仇敌、就是死。  
15:27 因为经上说、『　神叫万物都服在他的脚下。』既说万物都服了他、明显那叫万物服他的不在其内了。  
15:28 万物既服了他、那时、子也要自己服那叫万物服他的、叫　神在万物之上、为万物之主。  
15:29 不然、那些为死人受洗的、将来怎样呢。若死人总不复活、因何为他们受洗呢。  
15:30 我们又因何时刻冒险呢。  

15:31 弟兄们、我在我主基督耶稣里、指着你们所夸的口、极力的说、我是天天冒死。  
15:32 我若当日像寻常人、在以弗所同野兽战斗、那于我有甚么益处呢。若死人不复活、我们就吃吃喝喝吧。因为明天要死了。  
15:33 你们不要自欺。滥交是败坏善行。  
15:34 你们要醒悟为善、不要犯罪。因为有人不认识　神。我说这话、是要叫你们羞愧。  
15:35 或有人问、死人怎样复活。带着甚么身体来呢。  

15:36 无知的人哪、你所种的、若不死就不能生。  
15:37 并且你所种的、不是那将来的形体、不过是子粒、即如麦子、或是别样的谷。  
15:38 但　神随自己的意思、给他一个形体、并叫各等子粒、各有自己的形体。  
15:39 凡肉体各有不同。人是一样、兽又是一样、鸟又是一样、鱼又是一样。  
15:40 有天上的形体、也有地上的形体。但天上形体的荣光是一样、地上形体的荣光又是一样。  

15:41 日有日的荣光、月有月的荣光、星有星的荣光。这星和那星的荣光、也有分别。  
15:42 死人复活也是这样。所种的是必朽坏的、复活的是不朽坏的。  
15:43 所种的是羞辱的、复活的是荣耀的。所种的是软弱的、复活的是强壮的。  
15:44 所种的是血气的身体、复活的是灵性的身体。若有血气的身体、也必有灵性的身体。  
15:45 经上也是这样记着说、『首先的人亚当、成了有灵的活人。』〔灵或作血气〕末后的亚当、成了叫人活的灵。  

15:46 但属灵的不在先、属血气的在先。以后才有属灵的。  
15:47 头一个人是出于地、乃属土。第二个人是出于天。  
15:48 那属土的怎样、凡属土的也就怎样。属天的怎样、凡属天的也就怎样。  
15:49 我们既有属土的形状、将来也必有属天的形状。  
15:50 弟兄们、我告诉你们说、血肉之体、不能承受　神的国。必朽坏的、不能承受不朽坏的。  

15:51 我如今把一件奥秘的事告诉你们。我们不是都要睡觉、乃是都要改变、  
15:52 就在一霎时、眨眼之间、号筒末次吹响的时候。因号筒要响、死人要复活成为不朽坏的、我们也要改变。  
15:53 这必朽坏的、总要变成不朽坏的。〔变成原文作穿下同〕这必死的、总要变成不死的。  
15:54 这必朽坏的、既变成不朽坏的。这必死的、既变成不死的。那时经上所记、死被得胜吞灭的话就应验了。  
15:55 死阿、你得胜的权势在那里。死阿、你的毒钩在那里。  

15:56 死的毒钩就是罪。罪的权势就是律法。  
15:57 感谢　神、使我们借着我们的主耶稣基督得胜。  
15:58 所以我亲爱的弟兄们、你们务要坚固不可摇动、常常竭力多作主工、因为知道你们的劳苦、在主里面不是徒然的。
