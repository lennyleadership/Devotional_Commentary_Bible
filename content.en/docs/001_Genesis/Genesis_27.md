27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.  
27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:  
27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison:  
27:4 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.  
27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.  

27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,  
27:7 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.  
27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.  
27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:  
27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.  

27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:  
27:12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.  
27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.  
27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.  
27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:  

27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:  
27:17 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.  
27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?  
27:19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.  
27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.  

27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.  
27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.  
27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.  
27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.  
27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.  

27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.  
27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:  
27:28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:  
27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.  
27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  

27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.  
27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.  
27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.  
27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.  
27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.  

27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?  
27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  
27:38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.  
27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above:  
27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.  

27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.  
27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.  
27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran:  
27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away:  
27:45 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?  

27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?

27:1 以撒年老、眼睛昏花、不能看见、就叫了他大儿子以扫来、说、我儿、以扫说、我在这里。  
27:2 他说、我如今老了、不知道那一天死。  
27:3 现在拿你的器械、就是箭囊、和弓、往田野去为我打猎。  
27:4 照我所爱的作成美味、拿来给我吃、使我在未死之先、给你祝福。  
27:5 以撒对他儿子以扫说话、利百加也听见了。以扫往田野去打猎、要得野味带来。  

27:6 利百加就对他儿子雅各说、我听见你父亲对你哥哥以扫说、  
27:7 你去把野兽带来、作成美味给我吃、我好在未死之先、在耶和华面前给你祝福。』
27:8 现在我儿、你要照着我所吩咐你的、听从我的话。  
27:9 你到羊群里去、给我拿两只肥山羊羔来、我便照你父亲所爱的、给他作成美味。  
27:10 你拿到你父亲那里给他吃、使他在未死之先、给你祝福。  

27:11 雅各对他母亲利百加说、我哥哥以扫浑身是有毛的、我身上是光滑的。  
27:12 倘若我父亲摸着我、必以我为欺哄人的、我就招咒诅、不得祝福。  
27:13 他母亲对他说、我儿、你招的咒诅归到我身上、你只管听我的话、去把羊羔给我拿来。  
27:14 他便去拿来、交给他母亲、他母亲就照他父亲所爱的、作成美味。  
27:15 利百加又把家里所存大儿子以扫上好的衣服、给他小儿子雅各穿上。  

27:16 又用山羊羔皮、包在雅各的手上、和颈项的光滑处。  
27:17 就把所作的美味和饼、交在他儿子雅各的手里。  
27:18 雅各到他父亲那里说、我父亲、他说、我在这里、我儿、你是谁。  
27:19 雅各对他父亲说、我是你的长子以扫、我已照你所吩咐我的行了。请起来坐着、吃我的野味、好给我祝福。  
27:20 以撒对他儿子说、我儿、你如何找得这么快呢。他说、因为耶和华你的　神使我遇见好机会得着的。  

27:21 以撒对雅各说、我儿、你近前来、我摸摸你、知道你真是我的儿子以扫不是。  
27:22 雅各就挨近他父亲以撒。以撒摸着他说、声音是雅各的声音、手却是以扫的手。  
27:23 以撒就辨不出他来、因为他手上有毛、像他哥哥以扫的手一样、就给他祝福。  
27:24 又说、你真是我儿子以扫么、他说、我是。  
27:25 以撒说、你递给我、我好吃我儿子的野味、给你祝福。雅各就递给他、他便吃了。又拿酒给他、他也喝了。  

27:26 他父亲以撒对他说、我儿、你上前来与我亲嘴。  
27:27 他就上前与父亲亲嘴。他父亲一闻他衣服上的香气、就给他祝福、说、我儿的香气如同耶和华赐福之田地的香气一样。  
27:28 愿　神赐你天上的甘露、地上的肥土、并许多五谷新酒。  
27:29 愿多民事奉你、多国跪拜你。愿你作你弟兄的主、你母亲的儿子向你跪拜。凡咒诅你的、愿他受咒诅。为你祝福的、愿他蒙福。  
27:30 以撒为雅各祝福已毕、雅各从他父亲那里才出来、他哥哥以扫正打猎回来。  

27:31 也作了美味、拿来给他父亲、说、请父亲起来、吃你儿子的野味、好给我祝福。  
27:32 他父亲以撒对他说、你是谁、他说、我是你的长子以扫。  
27:33 以撒就大大的战兢、说、你未来之先、是谁得了野味拿来给我呢、我已经吃了、为他祝福、他将来也必蒙福。  
27:34 以扫听了他父亲的话、就放声痛哭、说、我父阿、求你也为我祝福。  
27:35 以撒说、你兄弟已经用诡计来将你的福分夺去了。  

27:36 以扫说、他名雅各岂不是正对么。因为他欺骗了我两次、他从前夺了我长子的名分、你看、他现在又夺了我的福分。以扫又说、你没有留下为我可祝的福么。  
27:37 以撒回答以扫说、我已立他为你的主、使他的弟兄都给他作仆人、并赐他五谷新酒可以养生、我儿、现在我还能为你作甚么呢。  
27:38 以扫对他父亲说、父阿、你只有一样可祝的福么、我父阿、求你也为我祝福。以扫就放声而哭。  
27:39 他父亲以撒说、地上的肥土必为你所住、天上的甘露必为你所得。  
27:40 你必倚靠刀剑度日、又必事奉你的兄弟、到你强盛的时候、必从你颈项上挣开他的轭。  

27:41 以扫因他父亲给雅各祝的福、就怨恨雅各、心里说、为我父亲居丧的日子近了、到那时候、我要杀我的兄弟雅各。  
27:42 有人把利百加大儿子以扫的话告诉利百加、他就打发人去、叫了他小儿子雅各来、对他说、你哥哥以扫想要杀你、报仇雪恨。  
27:43 现在我儿、你要听我的话、起来逃往哈兰我哥哥拉班那里去。  
27:44 同他住些日子、直等你哥哥的怒气消了。  
27:45 你哥哥向你消了怒气、忘了你向他所作的事、我便打发人去把你从那里带回来。为甚么一日丧你们二人呢。  

27:46 利百加对以撒说、我因这赫人的女子、连性命都厌烦了。倘若雅各也娶赫人的女子为妻、像这些一样、我活着还有甚么益处呢。

It is always in my mind that the event of Esau sold his birthright<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">God did not like Esau [Malachi 1:2-3] because Esau despised God's promise.</span> [Genesis 25:33] happened at the same time when Jacob took away the blessing from Isaac [Genesis 27].  When I re-read the bible about Jacob's life, I realized that these were two separate things [Genesis 27:36].

I believe Esau and Jacob were young when Esau sold his birthright, maybe they were teenage or around 20 years old, because the event was recorded in Genesis 25, and Genesis 26 told us Isaac married two women at his forth at the end of the chapter.  Issac was not aware of this event.  

Many years have passed, Issac was old. Jacob probably reached 50 years old (at least over 40 years old [Genesis 26:34]).  He deceived his father Isaac and got blessings because Isaac's eyes were dim and could not see.

Life went on and he had to escape from Esau. Uptill this moment in Jacob's life, he did not have personal relationship with God.

Jacob paid for his deception.  He was deceived by Laban.  At the beginning, he shepherded Laban's sheep for seven years expecting marriage with Rachel, but he married in the evening without knowing his wife was Leah.  He then served Laban another seven years to marry with Rachel.  I wonder if it was God's punishment [Hosea 12:2].

During Jacob's 20 years living together with Laban and serving Laban, Laban ripped off him by changing his wages 10 times [Genesis 31:41]. I wonder if it was God's punishment [Hosea 12:2].

How Jacob responded is striking, and it made himself exceedingly prosperous [Genesis 30:43].


God loved Jacob because He firstly *intervened* Jacob's life in his dream when Jacob was the on way to his uncle Laban, then He in the form of angel wrested with Jacob at the second time.
