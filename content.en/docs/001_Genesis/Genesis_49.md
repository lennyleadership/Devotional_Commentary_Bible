49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.  
49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.  
49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:  
49:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.  
49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.  

49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.  
49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.  
49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.  
49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?  
49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.  

49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:  
49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.  
49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.  
49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:  
49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.  

49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.  
49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.  
49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.  
49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.  
49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.  

49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.  
49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:  
49:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:  
49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:  

49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.  
49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.  
49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.  
49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,  
49:30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.  

49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.  
49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.  
49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.

49:1 雅各叫了他的儿子们来、说、你们都来聚集、我好把你们日后必遇的事告诉你们。  
49:2 雅各的儿子们、你们要聚集而听、要听你们父亲以色列的话。  
49:3 流便哪、你是我的长子、是我力量强壮的时候生的、本当大有尊荣、权力超众。  
49:4 但你放纵情欲、滚沸如水、必不得居首位、因为你上了你父亲的床、污秽了我的榻。<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">‪创世记‬35:22 和合本
22 以色列住在那地的时候，流便去与他父亲的妾辟拉同寝，以色列也听见了。雅各共有十二个儿子。<br>雅各当年没有立刻降罪于流便。上帝也没有立即马上降罪于我们，乃是宽容我们，给我们机会。</span>  
49:5 西缅和利未是弟兄、他们的刀剑是残忍的器具。  

49:6 我的灵阿、不要与他们同谋、我的心哪、不要与他们联络、因为他们趁怒杀害人命、任意砍断牛腿大筋。  
49:7 他们的怒气暴烈可咒。他们的忿恨残忍可诅。我要使他们分居在雅各家里、散住在以色列地中。  
49:8 犹大阿、你弟兄们必赞美你、你手必掐住仇敌的颈项、你父亲的儿子们必向你下拜。  
49:9 犹大是个小狮子。我儿阿、你抓了食便上去。你屈下身去、卧如公狮、蹲如母狮、谁敢惹你。  
49:10 圭必不离犹大、杖必不离他两脚之间、直等细罗〔就是赐平安者〕来到、万民都必归顺。  

49:11 犹大把小驴拴在葡萄树上、把驴驹拴在美好的葡萄树上、他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服、在葡萄汁中洗了袍褂。  
49:12 他的眼睛必因酒红润、他的牙齿必因奶白亮。  
49:13 西布伦必住在海口、必成为停船的海口。他的境界必延到西顿。  
49:14 以萨迦是个强壮的驴、卧在羊圈之中。  
49:15 他以安静为佳、以肥地为美、便低肩背重、成为服苦的仆人。  

49:16 但必判断他的民、作以色列支派之一。  
49:17 但必作道上的蛇、路中的虺、咬伤马蹄、使骑马的坠落于后。  
49:18 耶和华阿、我向来等候你的救恩。  
49:19 迦得必被敌军追逼、他却要追逼他们的脚跟。  
49:20 亚设之地必出肥美的粮食、且出君王的美味。  

49:21 拿弗他利是被释放的母鹿、他出嘉美的言语。  
49:22 约瑟是多结果子的树枝、是泉旁多结果的枝子、他的枝条探出墙外。  
49:23 弓箭手将他苦害、向他射箭、逼迫他。  
49:24 但他的弓仍旧坚硬、他的手健壮敏捷。这是因以色列的牧者、以色列的磐石、就是雅各的大能者。  
49:25 你父亲的　神、必帮助你、那全能者、必将天上所有的福、地里所藏的福、以及生产乳养的福、都赐给你。  

49:26 你父亲所祝的福、胜过我祖先所祝的福、如永世的山岭、至极的边界、这些福必降在约瑟的头上、临列那与弟兄迥别之人的顶上。  
49:27 便雅悯是个撕掠的狼、早晨要吃他所抓的、晚上要分他所夺的。  
49:28 这一切是以色列的十二支派。这也是他们的父亲对他们所说的话、为他们所祝的福、都是按着各人的福分、为他们祝福。  
49:29 他又嘱咐他们说、我将要归到我列祖〔原文作本民〕那里、你们要将我葬在赫人以弗仑田间的洞里、与我祖我父在一处、  
49:30 就是在迦南地幔利前、麦比拉田间的洞。那洞和田、是亚伯拉罕向赫人以弗仑买来为业、作坟地的。  

49:31 他们在那里葬了亚伯拉罕和他妻子撒拉。又在那里葬了以撒、和他妻子利百加。我也在那里葬了利亚。  
49:32 那块田和田间的洞、原是向赫人买的。  
49:33 雅各嘱咐众子已毕、就把脚收在床上、气绝而死、归到列祖〔原文作本民〕那里去了。
