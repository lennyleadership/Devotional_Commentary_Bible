25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.  
25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.  
25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.  
25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.  
25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.  

25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.  
25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.  
25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.  
25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre:  
25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.  

25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.  
25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:  
25:13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,  
25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,  
25:15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:  

25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.  
25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.  
25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.  
25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:  
25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.  

25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.  
25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.  
25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.  
25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  
25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.  

25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.  
25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.  
25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.  
25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:  
25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.  

25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.  
25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?  
25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.  
25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.

25:2 基土拉给他生了心兰、约珊、米但、米甸、伊施巴、和书亚。

25:4 米甸的儿子是以法、以弗、哈诺、亚比大、和以勒大。这都是基土拉的子孙。

25:6 亚伯拉罕把财物分给他庶出的众子、趁着自己还在世的时候、打发他们离开他的儿子以撒往东方去。  
25:7 亚伯拉罕一生的年日、是一百七十五岁。  
25:8 亚伯拉罕寿高年迈、气绝而死、归到他列祖〔原文作本民〕那里。  
25:9 他两个儿子以撒、以实玛利、把他埋葬在麦比拉洞里。这洞在幔利前、赫人琐辖的儿子以弗仑的田中、  
25:10 就是亚伯拉罕向赫人买的那块田。亚伯拉罕和他妻子撒拉、都葬在那里。  

25:11 亚伯拉罕死了以后、　神赐福给他的儿子以撒。以撒靠近庇耳拉海莱居住。  
25:12 撒拉的使女埃及人夏甲、给亚伯拉罕所生的儿子、是以实玛利。  
25:13 以实玛利儿子们的名字、按着他们的家谱、记在下面。以实玛利的长子是尼拜约、又有基达、亚德别、米比衫、  
25:14 米施玛、度玛、玛撒、  
25:15 哈大、提玛、伊突、拿非施、基底玛。

25:18 他子孙的住处在他众弟兄东边、从哈腓拉直到埃及前的书珥、正在亚述的道上。  
25:19 亚伯拉罕的儿子以撒的后代、记在下面。亚伯拉罕生以撒、  
25:20 以撒娶利百加为妻的时候、正四十岁。利百加是巴旦亚兰地的亚兰人、彼土利的女儿、是亚兰人拉班的妹子。  

25:21 以撒因他妻子不生育、就为他祈求耶和华、耶和华应允他的祈求、他的妻子利百加就怀了孕。  
25:22 孩子们在他腹中彼此相争、他就说、若是这样、我为甚么活着呢。〔或作我为甚么如此呢〕他就去求问耶和华。  
25:23 耶和华对他说、两国在你腹内、两族要从你身上出来、这族必强于那族、将来大的要服事小的。  
25:24 生产的日子到了、腹中果然是双子。  
25:25 先产的身体发红、浑身有毛、如同皮衣。他们就给他起名叫以扫。〔以扫就是有毛的意思〕  

25:26 随后又生了以扫的兄弟、手抓住以扫的脚跟、因此给他起名叫雅各。〔雅各就是抓住的意思〕利百加生下两个儿子的时候、以撒年正六十岁。  
25:27 两个孩子渐渐长大、以扫善于打猎、常在田野。雅各为人安静、常住在帐棚里。  
25:28 以撒爱以扫、因为常吃他的野味。利百加却爱雅各。  
25:29 有一天、雅各熬汤、以扫从田野回来累昏了。  
25:30 以扫对雅各说、我累昏了、求你把这红汤给我喝。因此以扫又叫以东。〔以东就是红的意思〕
