Genesis


Genesis Chapter 1  
1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  
1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  
1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  
1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.  
1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.  

1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  
1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.  
1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.  
1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  
1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  

1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.  
1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  
1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.  
1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  
1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  

1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  
1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  
1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  
1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  
1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  

1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  
1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  
1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  
1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  
1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  

1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  
1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  
1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  
1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  
1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  

1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

Genesis Chapter 2  
2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.  
2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.  
2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.  
2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,  
2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.  

2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.  
2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  
2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.  
2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  
2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.  

2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold:  
2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.  
2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.  
2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.  
2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.  

2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:  
2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.  
2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.  
2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.  
2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.  

2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:  
2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.  
2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.  
2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.  
2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

Genesis Chapter 3  
3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  
3:2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:  
3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  
3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  
3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  

3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.  
3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.  
3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.  
3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?  
3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.  

3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?  
3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.  
3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  
3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  
3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.  

3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.  
3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life:  
3:18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field:  
3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.  
3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.  

3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.  
3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:  
3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.  
3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

Genesis Chapter 4   
4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.  
4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.  
4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.  
4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:  
4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.  

4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?  
4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.  
4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.  
4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  
4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.  

4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand:  
4:12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.  
4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.  
4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.  
4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.  

4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.  
4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.  
4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.  
4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.  
4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.  

4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.  
4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.  
4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.  
4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.  
4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.  

4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 6  

6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,  
6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.  
6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.  
6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.  
6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.  

6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.  
6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.  
6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.  
6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.  
6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  

6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.  
6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.  
6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.  
6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.  
6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.  

6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.  
6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.  
6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.  
6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.  
6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.  

6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.  
6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 7  
7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.  
7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.  
7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.  
7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.  
7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.  

7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.  
7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.  
7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,  
7:9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.  
7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.  

7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  
7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.  
7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark:  
7:14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.  
7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.  

7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.  
7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.  
7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.  
7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.  
7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.  

7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:  
7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.  
7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.  
7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 8  

8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged:  
8:2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained:  
8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.  
8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.  
8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.  

8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:  
8:7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.  
8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground:  
8:9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.  
8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark:  

8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.  
8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.  
8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.  
8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.  
8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,  

8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.  
8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.  
8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:  
8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.  
8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.  

8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.  
8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

Genesis Chapter 9   
9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.  
9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.  
9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.  
9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.  
9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.  

9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.  
9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.  
9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,  
9:9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you:  
9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.  

9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.  
9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:  
9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.  
9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:  
9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.  

9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.  
9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.  
9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.  
9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.  
9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:  

9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.  
9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.  
9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.  
9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.  
9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.  

9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.  
9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.  
9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.  
9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 10   
10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.  
10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.  
10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.  
10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.  
10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.  

10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.  
10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.  
10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.  
10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.  
10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.  

10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,  
10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.  
10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,  
10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.  
10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,  

10:16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,  
10:17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,  
10:18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.  
10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.  
10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.  

10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.  
10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.  
10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.  
10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.  
10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.  

10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,  
10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,  
10:28 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,  
10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.  
10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.  

10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.  
10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 11 
11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.  
11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.  
11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.  
11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.  
11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.  

11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.  
11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.  
11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.  
11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.  
11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:  

11:11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.  
11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:  
11:13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.  
11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:  
11:15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.  

11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:  
11:17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.  
11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:  
11:19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.  
11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:  

11:21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.  
11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:  
11:23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.  
11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:  
11:25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.  

11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.  
11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.  
11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.  
11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.  
11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.  

11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.  
11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 12  
12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:  
12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:  
12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.  
12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.  
12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.  

12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.  
12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.  
12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.  
12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.  
12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.  

12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:  
12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.  
12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.  
12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.  
12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.  

12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.  
12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.  
12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  
12:19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.  
12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 13  
13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.  
13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.  
13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai:  
13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.  
13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.  

13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.  
13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.  
13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.  
13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.  
13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.  

13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.  
13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.  
13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.  
13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:  
13:15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.  

13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.  
13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.  
13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 14  
14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations:  
14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.  
14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.  
14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.  
14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,  

14:6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.  
14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.  
14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim:  
14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.  
14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.  

14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.  
14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.  
14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.  
14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.  
14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.  

14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.  
14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.  
14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.  
14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:  
14:20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.  

14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.  
14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,  
14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:  
14:24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 15  
15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.  
15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?  
15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.  
15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.  
15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.  

15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.  
15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.  
15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?  
15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.  
15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.  

15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.  
15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.  
15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years:  
15:14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.  
15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.  

15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.  
15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.  
15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:  
15:19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,  
15:20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,  

15:21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 16  
16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.  
16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.  
16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.  
16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.  
16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.  

16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.  
16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.  
16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.  
16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.  
16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.  

16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.  
16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.  
16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?  
16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.  
16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.  

16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 17   
17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.  
17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.  
17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,  
17:4 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.  
17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.  

17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.  
17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.  
17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.  
17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.  
17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.  

17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.  
17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.  
17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.  
17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.  
17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.  

17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.  
17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  
17:18 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  
17:19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.  
17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.  

17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.  
17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.  
17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.  
17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  
17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  

17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.  
17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

Genesis Chapter 18   
18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day:  
18:2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,  
18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:  
18:4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:  
18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.  

18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.  
18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.  
18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.  
18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.  
18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.  

18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.  
18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  
18:13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?  
18:14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.  
18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.  

18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.  
18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do:  
18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?  
18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.  
18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous:  

18:21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.  
18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.  
18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?  
18:24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?  
18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  

18:26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.  
18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:  
18:28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.  
18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.  
18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.  

18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.  
18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.  
18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

Genesis Chapter 19   
19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground:  
19:2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.  
19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.  
19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:  
19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.  

19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,  
19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.  
19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.  
19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.  
19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.  

19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.  
19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:  
19:13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.  
19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.  
19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.  

19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.  
19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.  
19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:  
19:19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:  
19:20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.  

19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.  
19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.  
19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.  
19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven:  
19:25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.  

19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.  
19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:  
19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.  
19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.  
19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.  

19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:  
19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  
19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  
19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  
19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  

19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.  
19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.  
19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

Genesis Chapter 20  
20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.  
20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.  
20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.  
20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?  
20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.  

20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.  
20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.  
20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.  
20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.  
20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?  

20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.  
20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.  
20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.  
20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.  
20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.  

20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.  
20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.  
20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 21   
21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.  
21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.  
21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.  
21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.  
21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.  

21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.  
21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.  
21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.  
21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.  
21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.  

21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.  
21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.  
21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.  
21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.  
21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.  

21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.  
21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.  
21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.  
21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.  
21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.  

21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.  
21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:  
21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.  
21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.  
21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.  

21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.  
21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.  
21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.  
21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?  
21:30 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.  

21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.  
21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.  
21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.  
21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 22  
22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.  
22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.  
22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.  
22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.  
22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.  

22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.  
22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  
22:8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.  
22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.  
22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.  

22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.  
22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.  
22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.  
22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.  
22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,  

22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:  
22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies:  
22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.  
22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.  
22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor:  

22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,  
22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.  
22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.  
22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 23  
23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.  
23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.  
23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,  
23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.  
23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,  

23:6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.  
23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.  
23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,  
23:9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.  
23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,  

23:11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.  
23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.  
23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.  
23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,  
23:15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.  

23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.  
23:17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.  
23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.  
23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 24   
24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.  
24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:  
24:3 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:  
24:4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.  
24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?  

24:6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.  
24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.  
24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.  
24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.  
24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.  

24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.  
24:12 And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.  
24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:  
24:14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.  
24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.  

24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.  
24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.  
24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.  
24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.  
24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.  

24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.  
24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold:  
24:23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?  
24:24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.  
24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.  

24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.  
24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.  
24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.  
24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.  
24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.  

24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.  
24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.  
24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.  
24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.  
24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.  

24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.  
24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:  
24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.  
24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.  
24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:  

24:41 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.  
24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:  
24:43 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink:  
24:44 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son.  
24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.  

24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.  
24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.  
24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.  
24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.  
24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.  

24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.  
24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.  
24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.  
24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.  
24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.  

24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.  
24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.  
24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.  
24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.  
24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.  

24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.  
24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.  
24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.  
24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.  
24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.  

24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.  
24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

Genesis Chapter 25   
25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.  
25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.  
25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.  
25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.  
25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.  

25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.  
25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.  
25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.  
25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre:  
25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.  

25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.  
25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:  
25:13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,  
25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,  
25:15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:  

25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.  
25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.  
25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.  
25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:  
25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.  

25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.  
25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.  
25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.  
25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  
25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.  

25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.  
25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.  
25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.  
25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:  
25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.  

25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.  
25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?  
25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.  
25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 26    
26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.  
26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:  
26:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father:  
26:4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed:  
26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.  

26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:  
26:7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.  
26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.  
26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.  
26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.  

26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.  
26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.  
26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:  
26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.  
26:15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.  

26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.  
26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.  
26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.  
26:19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.  
26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.  

26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.  
26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.  
26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.  
26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.  
26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.  

26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.  
26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?  
26:28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee:  
26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.  
26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.  

26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.  
26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.  
26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.  
26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:  
26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 27    
27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.  
27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:  
27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison:  
27:4 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.  
27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.  

27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,  
27:7 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.  
27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.  
27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:  
27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.  

27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:  
27:12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.  
27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.  
27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.  
27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:  

27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:  
27:17 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.  
27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?  
27:19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.  
27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.  

27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.  
27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.  
27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.  
27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.  
27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.  

27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.  
27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:  
27:28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:  
27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.  
27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  

27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.  
27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.  
27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.  
27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.  
27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.  

27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?  
27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  
27:38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.  
27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above:  
27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.  

27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.  
27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.  
27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran:  
27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away:  
27:45 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?  

27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 28  

28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.  
28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.  
28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people:  
28:4 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.  
28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.  

28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan:  
28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram:  
28:8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father:  
28:9 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.  
28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.  

28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.  
28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.  
28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed:  
28:14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.  
28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.  

28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.  
28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.  
28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.  
28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.  
28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,  

28:21 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:  
28:22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 29    
29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.  
29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.  
29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.  
29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.  
29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.  

29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.  
29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.  
29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.  
29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.  
29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.  

29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.  
29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.  
29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.  
29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.  
29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?  

29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.  
29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.  
29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.  
29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.  
29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.  

29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.  
29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.  
29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.  
29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.  
29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?  

29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.  
29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.  
29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.  
29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.  
29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.  

29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.  
29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.  
29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.  
29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.  
29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.

Genesis Chapter 30    
30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.  
30:2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?  
30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.  
30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.  
30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.  

30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.  
30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.  
30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.  
30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.  
30:10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.  

30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.  
30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.  
30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.  
30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.  
30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.  

30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.  
30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.  
30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.  
30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.  
30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.  

30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.  
30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.  
30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:  
30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.  
30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.  

30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.  
30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.  
30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.  
30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.  
30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  

30:31 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.  
30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.  
30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.  
30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.  
30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.  

30:36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.  
30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.  
30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.  
30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.  
30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.  

30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.  
30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.  
30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 31  
31:1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.  
31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.  
31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.  
31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,  
31:5 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.  

31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.  
31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.  
31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.  
31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.  
31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.  

31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.  
31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.  
31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.  
31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  
31:15 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.  

31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.  
31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels:  
31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.  
31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.  
31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.  

31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.  
31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.  
31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.  
31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.  
31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.  

31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?  
31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?  
31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.  
31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.  
31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?  

31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.  
31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.  
31:33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.  
31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.  
31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.  

31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?  
31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.  
31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.  
31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.  
31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.  

31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.  
31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.  
31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?  
31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.  
31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.  

31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.  
31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.  
31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:  
31:49 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.  
31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.  

31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:  
31:52 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.  
31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.  
31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.  
31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 32  
32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.  
32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.  
32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.  
32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:  
32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.  

32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.  
32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands:  
32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.  
32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:  
32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.  

32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.  
32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.  
32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother:  
32:14 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,  
32:15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.  

32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.  
32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?  
32:18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.  
32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.  
32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.  

32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.  
32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.  
32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.  
32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.  
32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.  

32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.  
32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.  
32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.  
32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.  
32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.  

32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.  
32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 33  
33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.  
33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.  
33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.  
33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.  
33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.  

33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.  
33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.  
33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.  
33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.  
33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.  

33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.  
33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.  
33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.  
33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.  
33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.  

33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.  
33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.  
33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.  
33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.  
33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 34  
34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.  
34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.  
34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.  
34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.  
34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.  

34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.  
34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.  
34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.  
34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.  
34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.  

34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.  
34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.  
34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:  
34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:  
34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised:  

34:16 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.  
34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.  
34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.  
34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.  
34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,  

34:21 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.  
34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.  
34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.  
34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.  
34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.  

34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.  
34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.  
34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,  
34:29 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.  
34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.  

34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?

Genesis Chapter 35   
35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.  
35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:  
35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.  
35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.  
35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.  

35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.  
35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.  
35:8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.  
35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.  
35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.  

35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins:  
35:12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.  
35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.  
35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.  
35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.  

35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.  
35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.  
35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.  
35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.  
35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.  

35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.  
35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:  
35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:  
35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:  
35:25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:  

35:26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.  
35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.  
35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.  
35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

Genesis Chapter 36    
36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.  
36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite:  
36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.  
36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.  
36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.  
36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:  
36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.  

36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.

36:16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.

36:19 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.  
36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,  

36:21 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.  
36:22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.  
36:23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.  
36:24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.  
36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.  

36:26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.  
36:27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.  
36:28 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.  
36:29 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,  
36:30 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.  

36:31 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.  
36:32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.  
36:33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.  
36:34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.

36:36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.  
36:37 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.  
36:38 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.  
36:39 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.  
36:40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,

36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,  
36:43 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.

Genesis Chapter 37    
37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.  
37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.  
37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.  
37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.  
37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.  

37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:  
37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.  
37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.  
37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.  
37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  

37:11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.  
37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.  
37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.  
37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.  
37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  

37:16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.  
37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.  
37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.  
37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.  
37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.  

37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.  
37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.  
37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him:  
37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.  
37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.  

37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?  
37:27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.  
37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.  
37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.  
37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?  

37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood:  
37:32 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.  
37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.  
37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.  
37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.  

37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 38    
38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.  
38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.  
38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.  
38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.  
38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.  

38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.  
38:7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.  
38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.  
38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.  
38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.  

38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.  
38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.  
38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.  
38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.  
38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.  

38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?  
38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  
38:18 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.  
38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.  
38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.  

38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.  
38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.  
38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.  
38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.  
38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.  

38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.  
38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.  
38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.  
38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.  
38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 39  
39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.  
39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.  
39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.  
39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.  
39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.  

39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.  
39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.  
39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand:  
39:9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?  
39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.  

39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.  
39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.  
39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,  
39:14 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:  
39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.  

39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.  
39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:  
39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.  
39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.  
39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.  

39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.  
39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.  
39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 40 

40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.  
40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.  
40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.  
40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.  
40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.  

40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.  
40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  
40:8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.  
40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me:  
40:10 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:  

40:11 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.  
40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:  
40:13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.  
40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:  
40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.  

40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:  
40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.  
40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:  
40:19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.  
40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.  

40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:  
40:22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.  
40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

Genesis Chapter 41     
41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.  
41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.  
41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.  
41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.  
41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.  

41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.  
41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.  
41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.  
41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:  
41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:  

41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.  
41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.  
41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.  
41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.  
41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.  

41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.  
41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:  
41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:  
41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:  
41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:  

41:21 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.  
41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:  
41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:  
41:24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.  
41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.  

41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.  
41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.  
41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.  
41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:  
41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land:  

41:31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.  
41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.  
41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.  
41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.  
41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.  

41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.  
41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.  
41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  
41:39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:  
41:40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.  

41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.  
41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck:  
41:43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.  
41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.  
41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.  

41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.  
41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.  
41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.  
41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.  
41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.  

41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.  
41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.  
41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.  
41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.  
41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.  

41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.  
41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 42    
42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  
42:2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.  
42:3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.  
42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.  
42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.  

42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.  
42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.  
42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.  
42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.  
42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.  

42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.  
42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.  
42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.  
42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:  
42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.  

42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.  
42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.  
42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:  
42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:  
42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.  

42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.  
42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.  
42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.  
42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.  
42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.  

42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.  
42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.  
42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  
42:29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,  
42:30 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.  

42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:  
42:32 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.  
42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:  
42:34 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.  
42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.  

42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.  
42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.  
42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 43   
43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.  
43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.  
43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.  
43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:  
43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.  

43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?  
43:7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?  
43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.  
43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:  
43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.  

43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:  
43:12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:  
43:13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:  
43:14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.  
43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.  

43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.  
43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.  
43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.  
43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,  
43:20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:  

43:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.  
43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.  
43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.  
43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.  
43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.  

43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.  
43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  
43:28 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.  
43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.  
43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.  

43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.  
43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.  
43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.  
43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 44   
44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.  
44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.  
44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.  
44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?  
44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.  

44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.  
44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:  
44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?  
44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.  
44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.  

44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.  
44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.  
44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.  
44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.  
44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  

44:16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.  
44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.  
44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.  
44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?  
44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.  

44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.  
44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.  
44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.  
44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.  
44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.  

44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.  
44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:  
44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:  
44:29 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.  
44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life:  

44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.  
44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.  
44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.  
44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 45   
45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.  
45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.  
45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.  
45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.  
45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.  

45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.  
45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.  
45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.  
45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:  
45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:  

45:11 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.  
45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.  
45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.  
45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.  
45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.  

45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.  
45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan:  
45:18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.  
45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.  
45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.  

45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.  
45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.  
45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.  
45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.  
45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,  

45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.  
45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:  
45:28 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 46   
46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.  
46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.  
46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:  
46:4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.  
46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.  

46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:  
46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.  
46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.  
46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.  
46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.  

46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.  
46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.  
46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.  
46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.  
46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.  

46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.  
46:17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.  
46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.  
46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.  
46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.  

46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.  
46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.  
46:23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.  
46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.  
46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.  

46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six:  
46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.  
46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.  
46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.  
46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.  

46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me:  
46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.  
46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?  
46:34 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 47  
47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.  
47:2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.  
47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.  
47:4 They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.  
47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:  

47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.  
47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.  
47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?  
47:9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.  
47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.  

47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.  
47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.  
47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.  
47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.  
47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.  

47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.  
47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.  
47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:  
47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.  
47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.  

47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.  
47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.  
47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.  
47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.  
47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.  

47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.  
47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.  
47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.  
47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:  
47:30 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.  

47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 48  

48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.  
48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.  
48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,  
48:4 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.  
48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.  

48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.  
48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.  
48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?  
48:9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.  
48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.  

48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.  
48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.  
48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.  
48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.  
48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,  

48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.  
48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.  
48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.  
48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.  
48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.  

48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.  
48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 49   
49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.  
49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.  
49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:  
49:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.  
49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.  

49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.  
49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.  
49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.  
49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?  
49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.  

49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:  
49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.  
49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.  
49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:  
49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.  

49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.  
49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.  
49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.  
49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.  
49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.  

49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.  
49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:  
49:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:  
49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:  

49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.  
49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.  
49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.  
49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,  
49:30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.  

49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.  
49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.  
49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.  

* ----------------------------------------
Genesis Chapter 50  
50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.  
50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.  
50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.  
50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,  
50:5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.  

50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.  
50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,  
50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.  
50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.  
50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.  

50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.  
50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:  
50:13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.  
50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.  
50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.  

50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,  
50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.  
50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.  
50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?  
50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.  

50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.  
50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.  
50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.  
50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.  
50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.  

50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

1:1 起初　神创造天地。  
1:2 地是空虚混沌。渊面黑暗。　神的灵运行在水面上。  
1:3 　神说、要有光、就有了光。  
1:4 　神看光是好的、就把光暗分开了。  
1:5 　神称光为昼、称暗为夜。有晚上、有早晨、这是头一日。  

1:6 　神说、诸水之间要有空气、将水分为上下。  
1:7 　神就造出空气、将空气以下的水、空气以上的水分开了。事就这样成了。  
1:8 　神称空气为天。有晚上、有早晨、是第二日。  
1:9 　神说、天下的水要聚在一处、使旱地露出来。事就这样成了。  
1:10 　神称旱地为地、称水的聚处为海。　神看着是好的。  

1:11 　神说、地要发生青草、和结种子的菜蔬、并结果子的树木、各从其类、果子都包着核。事就这样成了。  
1:12 于是地发生了青草、和结种子的菜蔬、各从其类、并结果子的树木、各从其类、果子都包着核。　神看着是好的。  
1:13 有晚上、有早晨、是第三日。  
1:14 　神说、天上要有光体、可以分昼夜、作记号、定节令、日子、年岁。  
1:15 并要发光在天空、普照在地上。事就这样成了。  

1:16 于是　神造了两个大光、大的管昼、小的管夜。又造众星。  
1:17 就把这些光摆列在天空、普照在地上、  
1:18 管理昼夜、分别明暗。　神看着是好的。  
1:19 有晚上、有早晨、是第四日。  
1:20 　神说、水要多多滋生有生命的物。要有雀鸟飞在地面以上、天空之中。  

1:21 　神就造出大鱼、和水中所滋生各样有生命的动物、各从其类。又造出各样飞鸟、各从其类。　神看着是好的。  
1:22 　神就赐福给这一切、说、滋生繁多、充满海中的水。雀鸟也要多生在地上。  
1:23 有晚上、有早晨、是第五日。  
1:24 　神说、地要生出活物来、各从其类。牲畜、昆虫、野兽、各从其类。事就这样成了。  
1:25 于是　神造出野兽、各从其类。牲畜、各从其类。地上一切昆虫、各从其类。　神看着是好的。  

1:26 　神说、我们要照着我们的形像、按着我们的样式造人、使他们管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟、地上的牲畜、和全地、并地上所爬的一切昆虫。  
1:27 　神就照着自己的形像造人、乃是照着他的形像造男造女。  
1:28 　神就赐福给他们、又对他们说、要生养众多、遍满地面、治理这地。也要管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟。和地上各样行动的活物。  
1:29 　神说、看哪、我将遍地上一切结种子的菜蔬、和一切树上所结有核的果子、全赐给你们作食物。  
1:30 至于地上的走兽、和空中的飞鸟、并各样爬在地上有生命的物、我将青草赐给他们作食物。事就这样成了。  

1:31 　神看着一切所造的都甚好。有晚上、有早晨、是第六日。

2:1 天地万物都造齐了。  
2:2 到第七日、　神造物的工已经完毕、就在第七日歇了他一切的工、安息了。  
2:3 　神赐福给第七日、定为圣日、因为在这日　神歇了他一切创造的工、就安息了。  
2:4 创造天地的来历、在耶和华　神造天地的日子、乃是这样。  
2:5 野地还没有草木、田间的菜蔬还没有长起来、因为耶和华　神还没有降雨在地上、也没有人耕地。  

2:6 但有雾气从地上腾、滋润遍地。  
2:7 耶和华　神用地上的尘土造人、将生气吹在他鼻孔里、他就成了有灵的活人、名叫亚当。  
2:8 耶和华　神在东方的伊甸立了一个园子、把所造的人安置在那里。  
2:9 耶和华　神使各样的树从地里长出来、可以悦人的眼目、其上的果子好作食物。园子当中又有生命树、和分别善恶的树。  
2:10 有河从伊甸流出来滋润那园子、从那里分为四道。  

2:11 第一道名叫比逊、就是环绕哈腓拉全地的。在那里有金子、  
2:12 并且那地的金子是好的。在那里又有珍珠和红玛瑙。  
2:13 第二道河名叫基训、就是环绕古实全地的。  
2:14 第三道河名叫希底结、流在亚述的东边。第四道河就是伯拉河。  
2:15 耶和华　神将那人安置在伊甸园、使他修理看守。  

2:16 耶和华　神吩咐他说、园中各样树上的果子、你可以随意吃。  
2:17 只是分别善恶树上的果子、你不可吃、因为你吃的日子必定死。  
2:18 耶和华　神说、那人独居不好、我要为他造一个配偶帮助他。  
2:19 耶和华　神用土所造成的野地各样走兽、和空中各样飞鸟、都带到那人面前看他叫甚么。那人怎样叫各样的活物、那就是他的名字。  
2:20 那人便给一切牲畜、和空中飞鸟、野地走兽都起了名。只是那人没有遇见配偶帮助他。  

2:21 耶和华　神使他沉睡、他就睡了。于是取下他的一条肋骨、又把肉合起来。  
2:22 耶和华　神就用那人身上所取的肋骨、造成一个女人、领他到那人跟前。  
2:23 那人说、这是我骨中的骨、肉中的肉、可以称他为女人、因为他是从男人身上取出来的。  
2:24 因此、人要离开父母、与妻子连合、二人成为一体。  
2:25 当时夫妻二人、赤身露体、并不羞耻。

创世纪 3章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24

3:1 耶和华　神所造的、惟有蛇比田野一切的活物更狡猾。蛇对女人说、　神岂是真说、不许你们吃园中所有树上的果子么。  
3:2 女人对蛇说、园中树上的果子我们可以吃。  
3:3 惟有园当中那棵树上的果子、　神曾说、你们不可吃、也不可摸、免得你们死。  
3:4 蛇对女人说、你们不一定死、  
3:5 因为　神知道、你们吃的日子眼睛就明亮了、你们便如　神能知道善恶。  

3:6 于是女人见那棵树的果子好作食物、也悦人的眼目、且是可喜爱的、能使人有智慧、就摘下果子来吃了。又给他丈夫、他丈夫也吃了。  
3:7 他们二人的眼睛就明亮了、才知道自己是赤身露体、便拿无花果树的叶子、为自己编作裙子。  
3:8 天起了凉风、耶和华　神在园中行走。那人和他妻子听见　神的声音、就藏在园里的树木中、躲避耶和华　神的面。  
3:9 耶和华　神呼唤那人、对他说、你在哪里。  
3:10 他说、我在园中听见你的声音、我就害怕、因为我赤身露体。我便藏了。  

3:11 耶和华说、谁告诉你赤身露体呢、莫非你吃了我吩咐你不可吃的那树上的果子么。  
3:12 那人说、你所赐给我、与我同居的女人、他把那树上的果子给我、我就吃了。  
3:13 耶和华　神对女人说、你作的是甚么事呢。女人说、那蛇引诱我、我就吃了。  
3:14 耶和华　神对蛇说、你既作了这事、就必受咒诅、比一切的牲畜野兽更甚、你必用肚子行走、终身吃土。  
3:15 我又要叫你和女人彼此为仇、你的后裔和女人的后裔、也彼此为仇。女人的后裔要伤你的头、你要伤他的脚跟。  

3:16 又对女人说、我必多多加增你怀胎的苦楚、你生产儿女必多受苦楚。你必恋慕你丈夫、你丈夫必管辖你。  
3:17 又对亚当说、你既听从妻子的话、吃了我所吩咐你不可吃的那树上的果子、地必为你的缘故受咒诅。你必终身劳苦、才能从地里得吃的。  
3:18 地必给你长出荆棘和蒺藜来、你也要吃田间的菜蔬。  
3:19 你必汗流满面才得糊口、直到你归了土、因为你是从土而出的。你本是尘土、仍要归于尘土。  
3:20 亚当给他妻子起名叫夏娃、因为他是众生之母。  

3:21 耶和华　神为亚当和他妻子用皮子作衣服、给他们穿。  
3:22 耶和华　神说、那人已经与我们相似、能知道善恶。现在恐怕他伸手又摘生命树的果子吃、就永远活着。  
3:23 耶和华　神便打发他出伊甸园去、耕种他所自出之土。  
3:24 于是把他赶出去了。又在伊甸园的东边安设基路伯、和四面转动发火焰的剑、要把守生命树的道路。

4:1 有一日、那人和他妻子夏娃同房、夏娃就怀孕、生了该隐、〔就是得的意思〕便说、耶和华使我得了一个男子。  
4:2 又生了该隐的兄弟亚伯。亚伯是牧羊的。该隐是种地的。  
4:3 有一日、该隐拿地里的出产为供物献给耶和华。  
4:4 亚伯也将他羊群中头生的、和羊的脂油献上。耶和华看中了亚伯和他的供物。  
4:5 只是看不中该隐和他的供物。该隐就大大的发怒、变了脸色。  

4:6 耶和华对该隐说、你为甚么发怒呢、你为甚么变了脸色呢。  
4:7 你若行得好、岂不蒙悦纳、你若行得不好、罪就伏在门前。他必恋慕你、你却要制伏他。  
4:8 该隐与他兄弟亚伯说话、二人正在田间、该隐起来打他兄弟亚伯、把他杀了。  
4:9 耶和华对该隐说、你兄弟亚伯在哪里。他说、我不知道、我岂是看守我兄弟的吗。  
4:10 耶和华说、你作了甚么事呢、你兄弟的血、有声音从地里向我哀告。  

4:11 地开了口、从你手里接受你兄弟的血。现在你必从这地受咒诅。  
4:12 你种地、地不再给你效力。你必流离飘荡在地上。  
4:13 该隐对耶和华说、我的刑罚太重、过于我所能当的。  
4:14 你如今赶逐我离开这地、以致不见你面。我必流离飘荡在地上、凡遇见我的必杀我。  
4:15 耶和华对他说、凡杀该隐的必遭报七倍。耶和华就给该隐立一个记号、免得人遇见他就杀他。  

4:16 于是该隐离开耶和华的面、去住在伊甸东边挪得之地。  
4:17 该隐与妻子同房、他妻子就怀孕、生了以诺、该隐建造了一座城、就按着他儿子的名将那城叫作以诺。  
4:18 以诺生以拿、以拿生米户雅利、米户雅利生玛土撒利、玛土撒利生拉麦。  
4:19 拉麦娶了两个妻、一个名叫亚大、一个名叫洗拉。  
4:20 亚大生雅八、雅八就是住帐棚牧养牲畜之人的祖师。  

4:21 雅八的兄弟名叫犹八。他是一切弹琴吹箫之人的祖师。  
4:22 洗拉又生了土八该隐、他是打造各样铜铁利器的、〔或作是铜匠铁匠的祖师〕土八该隐的妹子是拿玛。  
4:23 拉麦对他两个妻子说、亚大、洗拉、听我的声音、拉麦的妻子细听我的话语、壮年人伤我、我把他杀了、少年人损我、我把他害了。〔或作我杀壮士却伤自己我害幼童却损本身〕  
4:24 若杀该隐、遭报七倍、杀拉麦、必遭报七十七倍。  
4:25 亚当又与妻子同房、他就生了一个儿子、起名叫塞特、意思说、　神另给我立了一个儿子代替亚伯、因为该隐杀了他。  

4:26 塞特也生了一个儿子、起名叫以挪士。那时候人才求告耶和华的名。

6:1 当人在世上多起来、又生女儿的时候、  
6:2 　神的儿子们看见人的女子美貌、就随意挑选、娶来为妻。  
6:3 耶和华说、人既属乎血气、我的灵就不永远住在他里面、然而他的日子还可到一百二十年。  
6:4 那时候有伟人在地上、后来　神的儿子们、和人的女子们交合生子、那就是上古英武有名的人。  
6:5 耶和华见人在地上罪恶很大、终日所思想的尽都是恶。  

6:6 耶和华就后悔造人在地上、心中忧伤。  
6:7 耶和华说、我要将所造的人、和走兽、并昆虫、以及空中的飞鸟、都从地上除灭、因为我造他们后悔了。  
6:8 惟有挪亚在耶和华眼前蒙恩。  
6:9 挪亚的后代、记在下面。挪亚是个义人、在当时的世代是个完全人。挪亚与　神同行。  
6:10 挪亚生了三个儿子、就是闪、含、雅弗。  

6:11 世界在　神面前败坏。地上满了强暴。  
6:12 　神观看世界、见是败坏了。凡有血气的人、在地上都败坏了行为。  
6:13 　神就对挪亚说、凡有血气的人、他的尽头已经来到我面前、因为地上满了他们的强暴、我要把他们和地一并毁灭。  
6:14 你要用歌斐木造一只方舟、分一间一间的造、里外抹上松香。  
6:15 方舟的造法乃是这样、要长三百肘、宽五十肘、高三十肘。  

6:16 方舟上边要留透光处、高一肘。方舟的门要开在旁边。方舟要分上、中、下三层。  
6:17 看哪、我要使洪水泛滥在地上、毁灭天下、凡地上有血肉、有气息的活物、无一不死。  
6:18 我却要与你立约、你同你的妻、与儿子、儿妇、都要进入方舟。  
6:19 凡有血肉的活物、每样两个、一公一母、你要带进方舟、好在你那里保全生命。

7:1 耶和华对挪亚说、你和你的全家都要进入方舟、因为在这世代中、我见你在我面前是义人。  
7:2 凡洁净的畜类、你要带七公七母。不洁净的畜类、你要带一公一母。  
7:3 空中的飞鸟、也要带七公七母、可以留种、活在全地上、  
7:4 因为再过七天、我要降雨在地上四十昼夜、把我所造的各种活物、都从地上除灭。  
7:5 挪亚就遵着耶和华所吩咐的行了。  

7:6 当洪水泛滥在地上的时候、挪亚整六百岁。  
7:7 挪亚就同他的妻、和儿子、儿妇、都进入方舟、躲避洪水。  
7:8 洁净的畜类、和不洁净的畜类、飞鸟并地上一切的昆虫、  
7:9 都是一对一对的、有公有母、到挪亚那里进入方舟、正如　神所吩咐挪亚的。  
7:10 过了那七天、洪水泛滥在地上。  

7:11 当挪亚六百岁、二月十七日那一天、大渊的泉源、都裂开了、天上的窗户、也敞开了。  
7:12 四十昼夜降大雨在地上。  
7:13 正当那日、挪亚和他三个儿子、闪、含、雅弗、并挪亚的妻子、和三个儿妇、都进入方舟。  
7:14 他们和百兽、各从其类、一切牲畜、各从其类、爬在地上的昆虫、各从其类、一切禽鸟、各从其类、都进入方舟。  
7:15 凡有血肉、有气息的活物、都一对一对的到挪亚那里、进入方舟。  

7:16 凡有血肉进入方舟的、都是有公有母、正如　神所吩咐挪亚的。耶和华就把他关在方舟里头。  
7:17 洪水泛滥在地上四十天、水往上长、把方舟从地上漂起。  
7:18 水势浩大、在地上大大的往上长、方舟在水面上漂来漂去。  
7:19 水势在地上极其浩大、天下的高山都淹没了。  
7:20 水势比山高过十五肘、山岭都淹没了。  

7:21 凡在地上有血肉的动物、就是飞鸟、牲畜、走兽、和爬在地上的昆虫、以及所有的人都死了。  
7:22 凡在旱地上、鼻孔有气息的生灵都死了。  
7:23 凡地上各类的活物、连人带牲畜、昆虫、以及空中的飞鸟、都从地上除灭了、只留下挪亚和那些与他同在方舟里的。  
7:24 水势浩大、在地上共一百五十天。

8:1 　神记念挪亚、和挪亚方舟里的一切走兽牲畜。　神叫风吹地、水势渐落。  
8:2 渊源和天上的窗户、都闭塞了、天上的大雨也止住了。  
8:3 水从地上渐退。过了一百五十天、水就渐消。  
8:4 七月十七日、方舟停在亚拉腊山上。  
8:5 水又渐消、到十月初一日、山顶都现出来了。  

8:6 过了四十天、挪亚开了方舟的窗户、  
8:7 放出一只乌鸦去、那乌鸦飞来飞去、直到地上的水都干了。  
8:8 他又放出一只鸽子去、要看看水从地上退了没有。  
8:9 但遍地上都是水、鸽子找不着落脚之地、就回到方舟挪亚那里、挪亚伸手把鸽子接进方舟来。  
8:10 他又等了七天、再把鸽子从方舟放出去。  

8:11 到了晚上、鸽子回到他那里、嘴里叼着一个新拧下来的橄榄叶子、挪亚就知道地上的水退了。  
8:12 他又等了七天、放出鸽子去、鸽子就不再回来了。  
8:13 到挪亚六百零一岁、正月初一日、地上的水都干了。挪亚撤去方舟的盖观看、便见地面上干了。  
8:14 到了二月二十七日、地就都干了。  
8:15 　神对挪亚说、  

8:16 你和你的妻子、儿子、儿妇、都可以出方舟。  
8:17 在你那里凡有血肉的活物、就是飞鸟、牲畜、和一切爬在地上的昆虫、都要带出来、叫他在地上多多滋生、大大兴旺。  
8:18 于是挪亚和他的妻子、儿子、儿妇、都出来了。  
8:19 一切走兽、昆虫、飞鸟、和地上所有的动物、各从其类、也都出了方舟。  
8:20 挪亚为耶和华筑了一座坛、拿各类洁净的牲畜、飞鸟、献在坛上为燔祭。  

8:21 耶和华闻那馨香之气、就心里说、我不再因人的缘故咒诅地、（人从小时心里怀着恶念)也不再按着我才行的、灭各种的活物了。  
8:22 地还存留的时候、稼穑、寒暑、冬夏、昼夜、就永不停息了。

9:1 　神赐福给挪亚和他的儿子、对他们说、你们要生养众多、遍满了地。  
9:2 凡地上的走兽、和空中的飞鸟、都必惊恐、惧怕你们。连地上一切的昆虫、并海里一切的鱼、都交付你们的手。  
9:3 凡活着的动物、都可以作你们的食物、这一切我都赐给你们如同菜蔬一样。  
9:4 惟独肉带着血、那就是他的生命、你们不可吃。  
9:5 流你们血害你们命的、无论是兽、是人、我必讨他的罪、就是向各人的弟兄也是如此。  

9:6 凡流人血的、他的血也必被人所流、因为　神造人、是照自己的形像造的。  
9:7 你们要生养众多、在地上昌盛繁茂。  
9:8 　神晓谕挪亚和他的儿子说、  
9:9 我与你们和你们的后裔立约。  
9:10 并与你们这里的一切活物、就是飞鸟、牲畜、走兽。凡从方舟里出来的活物立约。  

9:11 我与你们立约、凡有血肉的、不再被洪水灭绝、也不再有洪水毁坏地了。  
9:12 　神说、我与你们、并你们这里的各样活物所立的永约、是有记号的。  
9:13 我把虹放在云彩中、这就可作我与地立约的记号了。  
9:14 我使云彩盖地的时候、必有虹现在云彩中。  
9:15 我便记念我与你们、和各样有血肉的活物所立的约、水就再不泛滥毁坏一切有血肉的物了。  

9:16 虹必现在云彩中、我看见、就要记念我与地上各样有血肉的活物所立的永约。  
9:17 　神对挪亚说、这就是我与地上一切有血肉之物立约的记号了。  
9:18 出方舟挪亚的儿子、就是闪、含、雅弗。含是迦南的父亲。  
9:19 这是挪亚的三个儿子。他们的后裔分散在全地。  
9:20 挪亚作起农夫来、栽了一个葡萄园。  

9:21 他喝了园中的酒便醉了。在帐棚里赤着身子。  
9:22 迦南的父亲含、看见他父亲赤身、就到外边告诉他两个弟兄。  
9:23 于是闪和雅弗、拿件衣服搭在肩上、倒退着进去、给他父亲盖上、他们背着脸就看不见父亲的赤身。  
9:24 挪亚醒了酒、知道小儿子向他所作的事、  
9:25 就说、迦南当受咒诅、必给他弟兄作奴仆的奴仆。  

9:26 又说、耶和华闪的　神、是应当称颂的、愿迦南作闪的奴仆。  
9:27 愿　神使雅弗扩张、使他住在闪的帐棚里。又愿迦南作他的奴仆。  
9:28 洪水以后、挪亚又活了三百五十年。  
9:29 挪亚共活了九百五十岁就死了。

11:1 那时、天下人的口音言语、都是一样。  
11:2 他们往东边迁移的时候、在示拿地遇见一片平原、就住在那里。  
11:3 他们彼此商量说、来吧、我们要作砖、把砖烧透了。他们就拿砖当石头、又拿石漆当灰泥。  
11:4 他们说、来吧、我们要建造一座城、和一座塔、塔顶通天、为要传扬我们的名、免得我们分散在全地上。  
11:5 耶和华降临要看看世人所建造的城和塔。  

11:6 耶和华说、看哪、他们成为一样的人民、都是一样的言语、如今既作起这事来、以后他们所要作的事、就没有不成就的了。  
11:7 我们下去、在那里变乱他们的口音、使他们的言语、彼此不通。  
11:8 于是耶和华使他们从那里分散在全地上。他们就停工、不造那城了。  
11:9 因为耶和华在那里变乱天下人的言语、使众人分散在全地上、所以那城名叫巴别。〔就是变乱的意思〕

创世纪 12章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

12:1 耶和华对亚伯兰说、你要离开本地、本族、父家、往我所要指示你的地去。  
12:2 我必叫你成为大国。我必赐福给你、叫你的名为大、你也要叫别人得福。  
12:3 为你祝福的、我必赐福与他、那咒诅你的、我必咒诅他、地上的万族都要因你得福。  
12:4 亚伯兰就照着耶和华的吩咐去了。罗得也和他同去。亚伯兰出哈兰的时候、年七十五岁。  
12:5 亚伯兰将他妻子撒莱、和侄儿罗得、连他们在哈兰所积蓄的财物、所得的人口、都带往迦南地去。他们就到了迦南地。  

12:6 亚伯兰经过那地、到了示剑地方摩利橡树那里。那时迦南人住在那地。  
12:7 耶和华向亚伯兰显现、说、我要把这地赐给你的后裔。亚伯兰就在那里为向他显现的耶和华筑了一座坛。  
12:8 从那里他又迁到伯特利东边的山、支搭帐棚。西边是伯特利、东边是艾。他在那里又为耶和华筑了一座坛、求告耶和华的名。  
12:9 后来亚伯兰又渐渐迁往南地去。  
12:10 那地遭遇饥荒、因饥荒甚大、亚伯兰就下埃及去、要在那里暂居。  

12:11 将近埃及就对他妻子撒莱说、我知道你是容貌俊美的妇人。  
12:12 埃及人看见你必说、这是他的妻子、他们就要杀我、却叫你存活。  
12:13 求你说、你是我的妹子、使我因你得平安、我的命也因你存活。  
12:14 及至亚伯兰到了埃及、埃及人看见那妇人极其美貌。  
12:15 法老的臣宰看见了他、就在法老面前夸奖他。那妇人就被带进法老的宫去。  

12:16 法老因这妇人就厚待亚伯兰、亚伯兰得了许多牛、羊、骆驼、公驴、母驴、仆婢。  
12:17 耶和华因亚伯兰妻子撒莱的缘故、降大灾与法老和他的全家。  
12:18 法老就召了亚伯兰来、说、你这向我作的是甚么事呢、为甚么没有告诉我他是你的妻子。  
12:19 为甚么说、他是你的妹子、以致我把他取来要作我的妻子。现在你的妻子在这里、可以带他走吧。  
12:20 于是法老吩咐人将亚伯兰和他妻子、并他所有的都送走了。

创世纪 13章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18

13:1 亚伯兰带着他的妻子与罗得、并一切所有的、都从埃及上南地去。  
13:2 亚伯兰的金、银、牲畜极多。  
13:3 他从南地渐渐往伯特利去、到了伯特利和艾的中间、就是从前支搭帐棚的地方、  
13:4 也是他起先筑坛的地方。他又在那里求告耶和华的名。  
13:5 与亚伯兰同行的罗得、也有牛群、羊群、帐棚。  

13:6 那地容不下他们、因为他们的财物甚多、使他们不能同居。  
13:7 当时迦南人、与比利洗人、在那地居住。亚伯兰的牧人、和罗得的牧人相争。  
13:8 亚伯兰就对罗得说、你我不可相争、你的牧人和我的牧人也不可相争、因为我们是骨肉。〔原文作弟兄〕  
13:9 遍地不都在你眼前么。请你离开我、你向左、我就向右、你向右、我就向左。  
13:10 罗得举目看见约但河的全平原、直到琐珥、都是滋润的、那地在耶和华未灭所多玛、蛾摩拉以先、如同耶和华的园子、也像埃及地。  

13:11 于是罗得选择约但河的全平原、往东迁移。他们就彼此分离了。  
13:12 亚伯兰住在迦南地、罗得住在平原的城邑、渐渐挪移帐棚、直到所多玛。  
13:13 所多玛人在耶和华面前罪大恶极。  
13:14 罗得离别亚伯兰以后、耶和华对亚伯兰说、从你所在的地方、你举目向东西南北观看。  
13:15 凡你所看见的一切地、我都要赐给你和你的后裔、直到永远。  

13:16 我也要使你的后裔如同地上的尘沙那样多、人若能数算地上的尘沙、才能数算你的后裔。  
13:17 你起来、纵横走遍这地、因为我必把这地赐给你。  
13:18 亚伯兰就搬了帐棚、来到希伯仑幔利的橡树那里居住、在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛。

14:1 当暗拉非作示拿王、亚略作以拉撒王、基大老玛作以拦王、提达作戈印王的时候、  
14:2 他们都攻打所多玛王比拉、蛾摩拉王比沙、押玛王示纳、洗扁王善以别、和比拉王。比拉就是琐珥。  
14:3 这五王都在西订谷会合。西订谷就是盐海。  
14:4 他们已经事奉基大老玛十二年、到十三年就背叛了。  
14:5 十四年基大老玛和同盟的王、都来在亚特律加宁、杀败了利乏音人、在哈麦杀败了苏西人、在沙微基列亭杀败了以米人、  

14:6 在何利人的西珥山杀败了何利人、一直杀到靠近旷野的伊勒巴兰。  
14:7 他们回到安密巴、就是加低斯、杀败了亚玛力全地的人、以及住在哈洗逊他玛的亚摩利人。  
14:8 于是所多玛王、蛾摩拉王、押玛王、洗扁王、和比拉王、（比拉就是琐珥)都出来、在西订谷摆阵、与他们交战。  
14:9 就是与以拦王基大老玛、戈印王提达、示拿王暗拉非、以拉撒王亚略交战。乃是四王与五王交战。  
14:10 西订谷有许多石漆坑。所多玛王、和蛾摩拉王逃跑、有掉在坑里的、其余的人都往山上逃跑。  

14:11 四王就把所多玛和蛾摩拉所有的财物、并一切的粮食、都掳掠去了。  
14:12 又把亚伯兰的侄儿罗得、和罗得的财物掳掠去了。当时、罗得正住在所多玛。  
14:13 有一个逃出来的人、告诉希伯来人亚伯兰。亚伯兰正住在亚摩利人幔利的橡树那里。幔利和以实各、并亚乃都是弟兄、曾与亚伯兰联盟。  
14:14 亚伯兰听见他侄儿〔原文作弟兄〕被掳去、就率领他家里生养的精练壮丁三百一十八人、直追到但。  
14:15 便在夜间、自己同仆人分队杀败敌人、又追到大马色左边的何把。  

14:16 将被掳掠的一切财物夺回来、连他侄儿罗得和他的财物、以及妇女人民、也都夺回来。  
14:17 亚伯兰杀败基大老玛、和与他同盟的王回来的时候、所多玛王出来、在沙微谷迎接他、沙微谷就是王谷。  
14:18 又有撒冷王麦基洗德、带着饼和酒、出来迎接。他是至高　神的祭司。  
14:19 他为亚伯兰祝福、说、愿天地的主、至高的　神、赐福与亚伯兰。  
14:20 至高的　神把敌人交在你手里、是应当称颂的。亚伯兰就把所得的、拿出十分之一来、给麦基洗德。  

14:21 所多玛王对亚伯兰说、你把人口给我、财物你自己拿去吧。  
14:22 亚伯兰对所多玛王说、我已经向天地的主、至高的　神耶和华起誓。  
14:23 凡是你的东西、就是一根线、一根鞋带、我都不拿、免得你说、我使亚伯兰富足。  
14:24 只有仆人所吃的、并与我同行的亚乃、以实各、幔利、所应得的分、可以任凭他们拿去。

15:1 这事以后、耶和华在异象中有话对亚伯兰说、亚伯兰你不要惧怕、我是你的盾牌、必大大的赏赐你。  
15:2 亚伯兰说、主耶和华阿、我既无子、你还赐我甚么呢。并且要承受我家业的、是大马色人以利以谢。  
15:3 亚伯兰又说、你没有给我儿子、那生在我家中的人、就是我的后嗣。  
15:4 耶和华又有话对他说、这人必不成为你的后嗣、你本身所生的、才成为你的后嗣。  
15:5 于是领他走到外边、说、你向天观看、数算众星、能数得过来么。又对他说、你的后裔将要如此。  

15:6 亚伯兰信耶和华、耶和华就以此为他的义。  
15:7 耶和华又对他说、我是耶和华、曾领你出了迦勒底的吾珥、为要将这地赐你为业。  
15:8 亚伯兰说、主耶和华阿、我怎能知道必得这地为业呢。  
15:9 他说、你为我取一只三年的母牛、一只三年的母山羊、一只三年的公绵羊、一只斑鸠、一只雏鸽。  
15:10 亚伯兰就取了这些来、每样劈开分成两半、一半对着一半的摆列、只有鸟没有劈开。  

15:11 有鸷鸟下来落在那死畜的肉上、亚伯兰就把他吓飞了。  
15:12 日头正落的时候、亚伯兰沉沉的睡了。忽然有惊人的大黑暗落在他身上。  
15:13 耶和华对亚伯兰说、你要的确知道、你的后裔必寄居别人的地、又服事那地的人。那地的人要苦待他们四百年。  
15:14 并且他们所要服事的那国、我要惩罚后来他们必带着许多财物、从那里出来。  
15:15 但你要享大寿数、平平安安的归到你列祖那里、被人埋葬。  

15:16 到了第四代、他们必回到此地、因为亚摩利人的罪孽、还没有满盈。  
15:17 日落天黑、不料有冒烟的炉、并烧着的火把、从那些肉块中经过。  
15:18 当那日耶和华与亚伯兰立约、说、我已赐给你的后裔、从埃及河直到伯拉大河之地。  
15:19 就是基尼人、基尼洗人、甲摩尼人、  
15:20 赫人、比利洗人、利乏音人、  

15:21 亚摩利人、迦南人、革迦撒人、耶布斯人、之地。

16:1 亚伯兰的妻子撒莱不给他生儿女。撒莱有一个使女名叫夏甲、是埃及人。  
16:2 撒莱对亚伯兰说、耶和华使我不能生育、求你和我的使女同房、或者我可以因他得孩子。〔得孩子原文作被建立〕亚伯兰听从了撒莱的话。  
16:3 于是亚伯兰的妻子撒莱、将使女埃及人夏甲给了丈夫为妾。那时亚伯兰在迦南已经住了十年。  
16:4 亚伯兰与夏甲同房、夏甲就怀了孕。他见自己有孕、就小看他的主母。  
16:5 撒莱对亚伯兰说、我因你受屈、我将我的使女放在你怀中、他见自己有了孕就小看我、愿耶和华在你我中间判断。  

16:6 亚伯兰对撒莱说、使女在你手下、你可以随意待他。撒莱苦待他、他就从撒莱面前逃走了。  
16:7 耶和华的使者在旷野、书珥路上的水泉旁遇见他、  
16:8 对他说、撒莱的使女夏甲、你从那里来、要往那里去。夏甲说、我从我的主母撒莱面前逃出来。  
16:9 耶和华的使者对他说、你回到你主母那里、服在他手下。  
16:10 又说、我必使你的后裔极其繁多、甚至不可胜数。  

16:11 并说、你如今怀孕要生一个儿子、可以给他起名叫以实玛利、因为耶和华听见了你的苦情。〔以实玛利就是　神听见的意思〕  
16:12 他为人必像野驴。他的手要攻打人、人的手也要攻打他、他必住在众弟兄的东边。  
16:13 夏甲就称那对他说话的耶和华为看顾人的　神。因而说、在这里我也看见那看顾我的么。  
16:14 所以这井名叫庇耳拉海莱。这井正在加低斯、和巴列中间。  
16:15 后来夏甲给亚伯兰生了一个儿子。亚伯兰给他起名叫以实玛利。  

16:16 夏甲给亚伯兰生以实玛利的时候、亚伯兰年八十六岁。

17:1 亚伯兰年九十九岁的时候、耶和华向他显现、对他说、我是全能的　神、你当在我面前作完全人。  
17:2 我就与你立约、使你的后裔极其繁多。  
17:3 亚伯兰俯伏在地、　神又对他说、  
17:4 我与你立约、你要作多国的父。  
17:5 从此以后、你的名不再叫亚伯兰、要叫亚伯拉罕、因为我已立你作多国的父。  

17:6 我必使你的后裔极其繁多、国度从你而立、君王从你而出。  
17:7 我要与你并你世世代代的后裔坚立我的约、作永远的约、是要作你和你后裔的　神。  
17:8 我要将你现在寄居的地、就是迦南全地、赐给你和你的后裔、永远为业。我也必作他们的　神。  
17:9 　神又对亚伯拉罕说、你和你的后裔必世世代代遵守我的约。  
17:10 你们所有的男子、都要受割礼、这就是我与你、并你的后裔所立的约、是你们所当遵守的。  

17:11 你们都要受割礼。〔受割礼原文作割阳皮十四二十三二十四二十五节同〕这是我与你们立约的证据。  
17:12 你们世世代代的男子、无论是家里生的、是在你后裔之外用银子从外人买的、生下来第八日、都要受割礼。  
17:13 你家里生的、和你用银子买的、都必须受割礼。这样、我的约就立在你们肉体上、作永远的约。  
17:14 但不受割礼的男子、必从民中剪除、因他背了我的约。  
17:15 　神又对亚伯拉罕说、你的妻子撒莱、不可再叫撒莱、他的名要叫撒拉。  

17:16 我必赐福给他、也要使你从他得一个儿子、我要赐福给他、他也要作多国之母、必有百姓的君王从他而出。  
17:17 亚伯拉罕就俯伏在地喜笑、心里说、一百岁的人、还能得孩子么。撒拉已经九十岁了、还能生养么。  
17:18 亚伯拉罕对　神说、但愿以实玛利活在你面前。  
17:19 　神说、不然、你妻子撒拉要给你生一个儿子、你要给他起名叫以撒、我要与他坚定所立的约、作他后裔永远的约。  
17:20 至于以实玛利、我也应允你、我必赐福给他、使他昌盛极其繁多、他必生十二个族长、我也要使他成为大国。  

17:21 到明年这时节、撒拉必给你生以撒、我要与他坚定所立的约。  
17:22 　神和亚伯拉罕说完了话、就离开他上升去了。  
17:23 正当那日、亚伯拉罕遵着　神的命、给他的儿子以实玛利和家里的一切男子、无论是在家里生的、是用银子买的、都行了割礼。  
17:24 亚伯拉罕受割礼的时候、年九十九岁。  
17:25 他儿子以实玛利受割礼的时候、年十三岁。  

17:26 正当那日、亚伯拉罕和他儿子以实玛利、一同受了割礼。  
17:27 家里所有的人、无论是在家里生的、是用银子从外人买的、也都一同受了割礼。

18:1 耶和华在幔利橡树那里、向亚伯拉罕显现出来。那时正热、亚伯拉罕坐在帐棚门口。  
18:2 举目观看、见有三个人在对面站着。他一见、就从帐棚门口跑去迎接他们、俯伏在地、  
18:3 说、我主、我若在你眼前蒙恩、求你不要离开仆人往前去。  
18:4 容我拿点水来、你们洗洗脚、在树下歇息歇息。  
18:5 我再拿一点饼来、你们可以加添心力、然后往前去、你们既到仆人这里来、理当如此。他们说、就照你说的行吧。  

18:6 亚伯拉罕急忙进帐棚见撒拉说、你速速拿三细亚细面调和作饼。  
18:7 亚伯拉罕又跑到牛群里、牵了一只又嫩又好的牛犊来、交给仆人、仆人急忙预备好了。  
18:8 亚伯拉罕又取了奶油和奶、并预备好的牛犊来、摆在他们面前、自己在树下站在旁边、他们就吃了。  
18:9 他们问亚伯拉罕说、你妻子撒拉在那里、他说、在帐棚里。  
18:10 三人中有一位说、到明年这时候、我必要回到你这里、你的妻子撒拉必生一个儿子。撒拉在那人后边的帐棚门口、也听见了这话。  

18:11 亚伯拉罕和撒拉年纪老迈、撒拉的月经已断绝了。  
18:12 撒拉心里暗笑、说、我既已衰败、我主也老迈、岂能有这喜事呢。  
18:13 耶和华对亚伯拉罕说、撒拉为甚么暗笑、说、我既已年老、果真能生养吗。  
18:14 耶和华岂有难成的事么。到了日期、明年这时候、我必回到你这里、撒拉必生一个儿子。  
18:15 撒拉就害怕、不承认、说、我没有笑。那位说、不然、你实在笑了。  

18:16 三人就从那里起行、向所多玛观看、亚伯拉罕也与他们同行、要送他们一程。  
18:17 耶和华说、我所要作的事、岂可瞒着亚伯拉罕呢。  
18:18 亚伯拉罕必要成为强大的国、地上的万国都必因他得福。  
18:19 我眷顾他、为要叫他吩咐他的众子、和他的眷属、遵守我的道、秉公行义、使我所应许亚伯拉罕的话都成就了。  
18:20 耶和华说、所多玛和蛾摩拉的罪恶甚重、声闻于我。  

18:21 我现在要下去、察看他们所行的、果然尽像那达到我耳中的声音一样么。若是不然、我也必知道。  
18:22 二人转身离开那里、向所多玛去、但亚伯拉罕仍旧站在耶和华面前。  
18:23 亚伯拉罕近前来说、无论善恶、你都要剿灭么。  
18:24 假若那城里有五十个义人、你还剿灭那地方么。不为城里这五十个义人饶恕其中的人么。  
18:25 将义人与恶人同杀、将义人与恶人一样看待、这断不是你所行的。审判全地的主、岂不行公义么。  

18:26 耶和华说、我若在所多玛城里见有五十个义人、我就为他们的缘故、饶恕那地方的众人。  
18:27 亚伯拉罕说、我虽然是灰尘、还敢对主说话。  
18:28 假若这五十个义人短了五个、你就因为短了五个毁灭全城么。他说、我在那里若见有四十五个、也不毁灭那城。  
18:29 亚伯拉罕又对他说、假若在那里见有四十个怎么样呢。他说、为这四十个的缘故、我也不作这事。  
18:30 亚伯拉罕说、求主不要动怒、容我说。假若在那里见有三十个怎么样呢。他说、我在那里若见有三十个、我也不作这事。  

18:31 亚伯拉罕说、我还敢对主说话、假若在那里见有二十个怎么样呢。他说、为这二十个的缘故、我也不毁灭那城。  
18:32 亚伯拉罕说、求主不要动怒、我再说这一次、假若在那里见有十个呢。他说、为这十个的缘故、我也不毁灭那城。  
18:33 耶和华与亚伯拉罕说完了话就走了。亚伯拉罕也回到自己的地方去了。

19:1 那两个天使晚上到了所多玛。罗得正坐在所多玛城门口。看见他们、就起来迎接、脸伏于地下拜、  
19:2 说、我主阿、请你们到仆人家里洗洗脚、住一夜、清早起来再走。他们说、不、我们要在街上过夜。  
19:3 罗得切切的请他们、他们这才进去到他屋里。罗得为他们预备筵席、烤无酵饼、他们就吃了。  
19:4 他们还没有躺下、所多玛城里各处的人、连老带少、都来围住那房子。  
19:5 呼叫罗得说、今日晚上到你这里来的人在哪里呢。把他们带出来、任我们所为。  

19:6 罗得出来、把门关上、到众人那里、  
19:7 说、众弟兄请你们不要作这恶事。  
19:8 我有两个女儿、还是处女、容我领出来任凭你们的心愿而行、只是这两个人既然到我舍下、不要向他们作甚么。  
19:9 众人说、退去吧。又说、这个人来寄居、还想要作官哪。现在我们要害你比害他们更甚、众人就向前拥挤罗得、要攻破房门。  
19:10 只是那二人伸出手来、将罗得拉进屋去、把门关上。  

19:11 并且使门外的人、无论老少、眼都昏迷。他们摸来摸去、总寻不着房门。  
19:12 二人对罗得说、你这里还有甚么人么。无论是女婿、是儿女、和这城中一切属你的人、你都要将他们从这地方带出去。  
19:13 我们要毁灭这地方、因为城内罪恶的声音、在耶和华面前甚大、耶和华差我们来、要毁灭这地方。  
19:14 罗得就出去、告诉娶了他女儿的女婿们、〔娶了或作将要娶〕说、你们起来离开这地方、因为耶和华要毁灭这城。他女婿们却以为他说的是戏言。  
19:15 天明了、天使催逼罗得说、起来、带着你的妻子、和你在这里的两个女儿出去、免得你因这城里的罪恶、同被剿灭。  

19:16 但罗得迟延不走。二人因为耶和华怜恤罗得、就拉着他的手、和他妻子的手、并他两个女儿的手、把他们领出来、安置在城外。  
19:17 领他们出来以后、就说、逃命吧。不可回头看、也不可在平原站住、要往山上逃跑、免得你被剿灭。  
19:18 罗得对他们说、我主阿、不要如此。  
19:19 你仆人已经在你眼前蒙恩、你又向我显出莫大的慈爱、救我的性命、我不能逃到山上去、恐怕这灾祸临到我、我便死了。  
19:20 看哪、这座城又小又近、容易逃到、这不是一个小的么。求你容我逃到那里、我的性命就得存活。  

19:21 天使对他说、这事我也应允你、我不倾覆你所说的这城、  
19:22 你要速速的逃到那城、因为你还没有到那里我不能作甚么。因此那城名叫琐珥。〔琐珥就是小的意思〕  
19:23 罗得到了琐珥、日头已经出来了。  
19:24 当时耶和华将硫磺与火、从天上耶和华那里、降与所多玛和蛾摩拉、  
19:25 把那些城、和全平原、并城里所有的居民、连地上生长的、都毁灭了。  

19:26 罗得的妻子在后边回头一看、就变成了一根盐柱。  
19:27 亚伯拉罕清早起来、到了他从前站在耶和华面前的地方、  
19:28 向所多玛、和蛾摩拉、与平原的全地观看。不料、那地方烟气上腾、如同烧窑一般。  
19:29 当　神毁灭平原诸城的时候、他记念亚伯拉罕、正在倾覆罗得所住之城的时候、就打发罗得从倾覆之中出来。  
19:30 罗得因为怕住在琐珥、就同他两个女儿从琐珥上去住在山里。他和两个女儿住在一个洞里。  

19:31 大女儿对小女儿说、我们的父亲老了、地上又无人按着世上的常规、进到我们这里。  
19:32 来、我们可以叫父亲喝酒、与他同寝。这样、我们好从他存留后裔。  
19:33 于是那夜他们叫父亲喝酒、大女儿就进去和他父亲同寝。他几时躺下、几时起来、父亲都不知道。  
19:34 第二天、大女儿对小女儿说、我昨夜与父亲同寝、今夜我们再叫他喝酒、你可以进去与他同寝。这样、我们好从父亲存留后裔。  
19:35 于是那夜他们又叫父亲喝酒、小女儿起来与他父亲同寝。他几时躺下、几时起来、父亲都不知道。  

19:36 这样、罗得的两个女儿、都从他父亲怀了孕。  
19:37 大女儿生了儿子、给他起名叫摩押、就是现今摩押人的始祖。  
19:38 小女儿也生了儿子、给他起名叫便亚米、就是现今亚扪人的始祖。

创世纪 20章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18

20:1 亚伯拉罕从那里向南地迁去、寄居在加低斯和书珥中间的基拉耳。  
20:2 亚伯拉罕称他的妻撒拉为妹子、基拉耳王亚比米勒差人把撒拉取了去。  
20:3 但夜间　神来在梦中、对亚比米勒说、你是个死人哪、因为你取了那女人来、他原是别人的妻子。  
20:4 亚比米勒却还没有亲近撒拉。他说、主阿、连有义的国你也要毁灭么。  
20:5 那人岂不是自己对我说、他是我的妹子么。就是女人也自己说、他是我的哥哥。我作这事、是心正手洁的。  

20:6 　神在梦中对他说、我知道你作这事是心中正直、我也拦阻了你、免得你得罪我、所以我不容你沾着他。  
20:7 现在你把这人的妻子归还他、因为他是先知、他要为你祷告、使你存活。你若不归还他、你当知道、你和你所有的人、都必要死。  
20:8 亚比米勒清早起来、召了众臣仆来、将这些事都说给他们听、他们都甚惧怕。  
20:9 亚比米勒召了亚伯拉罕来、对他说、你怎么向我这样行呢、我在甚么事上得罪了你、你竟使我和我国里的人陷在大罪里。你向我行不当行的事了。  
20:10 亚比米勒又对亚伯拉罕说、你见了甚么才作这事呢。  

20:11 亚伯拉罕说、我以为这地方的人总不惧怕　神、必为我妻子的缘故杀我。  
20:12 况且他也实在是我的妹子、他与我是同父异母、后来作了我的妻子。  
20:13 当　神叫我离开父家飘流在外的时候、我对他说、我们无论走到甚么地方、你可以对人说、他是我的哥哥。这就是你待我的恩典了。  
20:14 亚比米勒把牛羊、仆婢赐给亚伯拉罕、又把他的妻子撒拉归还他。  
20:15 亚比米勒又说、看哪、我的地都在你面前、你可以随意居住。  

20:16 又对撒拉说、我给你哥哥一千银子、作为你在合家人面前遮羞的、〔羞原文作眼〕你就在众人面前没有不是了。  
20:17 亚伯拉罕祷告　神、　神就医好了亚比米勒和他的妻子、并他的众女仆、他们便能生育。  
20:18 因耶和华为亚伯拉罕的妻子撒拉的缘故、已经使亚比米勒家中的妇人、不能生育。

创世纪 21章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34

21:1 耶和华按着先前的话、眷顾撒拉、便照他所说的给撒拉成就。  
21:2 当亚伯拉罕年老的时候、撒拉怀了孕。到　神所说的日期、就给亚伯拉罕生了一个儿子。  
21:3 亚伯拉罕给撒拉所生的儿子起名叫以撒。  
21:4 以撒生下来第八日、亚伯拉罕照着　神所吩咐的、给以撒行了割礼。  
21:5 他儿子以撒生的时候、亚伯拉罕年一百岁。  

21:6 撒拉说、　神使我喜笑、凡听见的必与我一同喜笑。  
21:7 又说、谁能预先对亚伯拉罕说、撒拉要乳养婴孩呢、因为在他年老的时候、我给他生了一个儿子。  
21:8 孩子渐长、就断了奶。以撒断奶的日子、亚伯拉罕设摆丰盛的筵席。  
21:9 当时、撒拉看见埃及人夏甲给亚伯拉罕所生的儿子戏笑、  
21:10 就对亚伯拉罕说、你把这使女、和他儿子赶出去、因为这使女的儿子、不可与我的儿子以撒、一同承受产业。  

21:11 亚伯拉罕因他儿子的缘故很忧愁。  
21:12 　神对亚伯拉罕说、你不必为这童子和你的使女忧愁、凡撒拉对你说的话、你都该听从。因为从以撒生的、才要称为你的后裔。  
21:13 至于使女的儿子、我也必使他的后裔成立一国、因为他是你所生的。  
21:14 亚伯拉罕清早起来、拿饼和一皮袋水、给了夏甲、搭在他的肩上、又把孩子交给他、打发他走。夏甲就走了、在别是巴的旷野走迷了路。  
21:15 皮袋的水用尽了、夏甲就把孩子撇在小树底下、  

21:16 自己走开约有一箭之远、相对而坐、说、我不忍见孩子死、就相对而坐、放声大哭。  
21:17 　神听见童子的声音。　神的使者从天上呼叫夏甲说、夏甲、你为何这样呢、不要害怕、　神已经听见童子的声音了。  
21:18 起来、把童子抱在怀中、〔怀原文作手〕我必使他的后裔成为大国。  
21:19 　神使夏甲的眼睛明亮、他就看见一口水井、便去将皮袋盛满了水、给童子喝。  
21:20 　神保佑童子、他就渐长、住在旷野、成了弓箭手。  

21:21 他住在巴兰的旷野、他母亲从埃及地给他娶了一个妻子。  
21:22 当那时候、亚比米勒同他军长非各、对亚伯拉罕说、凡你所行的事、都有　神的保佑。  
21:23 我愿你如今在这里指着　神对我起誓、不要欺负我与我的儿子、并我的子孙、我怎样厚待了你、你也要照样厚待我、与你所寄居这地的民。  
21:24 亚伯拉罕说、我情愿起誓。  
21:25 从前亚比米勒的仆人、霸占了一口水井、亚伯拉罕为这事指责亚比米勒。  

21:26 亚比米勒说、谁作这事我不知道、你也没有告诉我、今日我才听见了。  
21:27 亚伯拉罕把羊和牛给了亚比米勒、二人就彼此立约。  
21:28 亚伯拉罕把七只母羊羔另放在一处。  
21:29 亚比米勒问亚伯拉罕说、你把这七只母羊羔另放在一处、是甚么意思呢。  
21:30 他说、你要从我手里受这七只母羊羔、作我挖这口井的证据。  

21:31 所以他给那地方起名叫别是巴、因为他们二人在那里起了誓。〔别是巴就是盟誓的井〕  
21:32 他们在别是巴立了约。亚比米勒就同他军长非各、起身回非利士地去了。  
21:33 亚伯拉罕在别是巴栽上一棵垂丝柳树、又在那里求告耶和华永生　神的名。  
21:34 亚伯拉罕在非利士人的地寄居了多日。

22:1 这些事以后、　神要试验亚伯拉罕、就呼叫他说、亚伯拉罕、他说、我在这里。  
22:2 　神说、你带着你的儿子、就是你独生的儿子、你所爱的以撒、往摩利亚地去、在我所要指示你的山上、把他献为燔祭。  
22:3 亚伯拉罕清早起来、备上驴、带着两个仆人和他儿子以撒、也劈好了燔祭的柴、就起身往　神所指示他的地方去了。  
22:4 到了第三日、亚伯拉罕举目远远的看见那地方。  
22:5 亚伯拉罕对他的仆人说、你们和驴在此等候、我与童子往那里去拜一拜、就回到你们这里来。  

22:6 亚伯拉罕把燔祭的柴放在他儿子以撒身上、自己手里拿着火与刀。于是二人同行。  
22:7 以撒对他父亲亚伯拉罕说、父亲哪。亚伯拉罕说、我儿、我在这里。以撒说、请看、火与柴都有了、但燔祭的羊羔在哪里呢。  
22:8 亚伯拉罕说、我儿、　神必自己预备作燔祭的羊羔。于是二人同行。  
22:9 他们到了　神所指示的地方、亚伯拉罕在那里筑坛、把柴摆好、捆绑他的儿子以撒、放在坛的柴上。  
22:10 亚伯拉罕就伸手拿刀、要杀他的儿子。  

22:11 耶和华的使者从天上呼叫他说、亚伯拉罕、亚伯拉罕、他说、我在这里。  
22:12 天使说、你不可在这童子身上下手、一点不可害他。现在我知道你是敬畏　神的了、因为你没有将你的儿子、就是你独生的儿子、留下不给我。  
22:13 亚伯拉罕举目观看、不料、有一只公羊、两角扣在稠密的小树中、亚伯拉罕就取了那只公羊来、献为燔祭、代替他的儿子。  
22:14 亚伯拉罕给那地方起名叫耶和华以勒、〔意思就是耶和华必预备〕直到今日人还说、在耶和华的山上必有预备。  
22:15 耶和华的使者第二次从天上呼叫亚伯拉罕说、  

22:16 耶和华说你既行了这事、不留下你的儿子、就是你独生的儿子、我便指着自己起誓说、  
22:17 论福、我必赐大福给你、论子孙、我必叫你的子孙多起来、如同天上的星、海边的沙、你子孙必得着仇敌的城门。  
22:18 并且地上万国都必因你的后裔得福、因为你听从了我的话。  
22:19 于是亚伯拉罕回到他仆人那里、他们一同起身往别是巴去、亚伯拉罕就住在别是巴。  
22:20 这事以后、有人告诉亚伯拉罕说、密迦给你兄弟拿鹤生了几个儿子、  

22:21 长子是乌斯、他的兄弟是布斯、和亚兰的父亲基母利。  
22:22 并基薛、哈琐、必达、益拉、彼土利、（彼土利生利百加)
22:23 这八个人、都是密迦给亚伯拉罕的兄弟拿鹤生的。  
22:24 拿鹤的妾名叫流玛、生了提八、迦含、他辖、和玛迦。

创世纪 23章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

23:1 撒拉享寿一百二十七岁、这是撒拉一生的岁数。  
23:2 撒拉死在迦南地的基列亚巴、就是希伯仑、亚伯拉罕为他哀恸哭号。  
23:3 后来亚伯拉罕从死人面前起来、对赫人说、  
23:4 我在你们中间是外人、是寄居的、求你们在这里给我一块地、我好埋葬我的死人、使他不在我眼前。  
23:5 赫人回答亚伯拉罕说、  

23:6 我主请听、你在我们中间是一位尊大的王子、只管在我们最好的坟地里埋葬你的死人、我们没有一人不容你在他的坟地里埋葬你的死人。  
23:7 亚伯拉罕就起来、向那地的赫人下拜。  
23:8 对他们说、你们若有意叫我埋葬我的死人、使他不在我眼前、就请听我的话、为我求琐辖的儿子以弗仑、  
23:9 把田头上那麦比拉洞给我、他可以按着足价卖给我、作我在你们中间的坟地。  
23:10 当时以弗仑正坐在赫人中间。于是赫人以弗仑、在城门出入的赫人、面前对亚伯拉罕说、  

23:11 不然、我主请听、我送给你这块田、连田间的洞、也送给你、在我同族的人面前都给你、可以埋葬你的死人。  
23:12 亚伯拉罕就在那地的人民面前下拜。  
23:13 在他们面前对以弗仑说、你若应允、请听我的话、我要把田价给你、求你收下、我就在那里埋葬我的死人。  
23:14 以弗仑回答亚伯拉罕说、  
23:15 我主请听、值四百舍客勒银子的一块田、在你我中间还算甚么呢、只管埋葬你的死人吧。  

23:16 亚伯拉罕听从了以弗仑、照着他在赫人面前所说的话、把买卖通用的银子、平了四百舍客勒给以弗仑。  
23:17 于是麦比拉、幔利前、以弗仑的那块田、和其中的洞、并田间四围的树木、  
23:18 都定准归与亚伯拉罕、乃是他在赫人面前、并城门出入的人面前买妥的。  
23:19 此后、亚伯拉罕把他妻子撒拉埋葬在迦南地幔利前的麦比拉田间的洞里、幔利就是希伯仑。  
23:20 从此、那块田、和田间的洞、就借着赫人定准、归与亚伯拉罕作坟地。

24:1 亚伯拉罕年纪老迈、向来在一切事上、耶和华都赐福给他。  
24:2 亚伯拉罕对管理他全业最老的仆人说、请你把手放在我大腿底下。  
24:3 我要叫你指着耶和华天地的主起誓、不要为我儿子娶这迦南地中的女子为妻。  
24:4 你要往我本地本族去、为我的儿子以撒娶一个妻子。  
24:5 仆人对他说、倘若女子不肯跟我到这地方来、我必须将你的儿子带回你原出之地么。  

24:6 亚伯拉罕对他说、你要谨慎、不要带我的儿子回那里去。  
24:7 耶和华天上的主、曾带领我离开父家和本族的地、对我说话向我起誓、说、我要将这地赐给你的后裔。他必差遣使者在你面前、你就可以从那里为我儿子娶一个妻子。  
24:8 倘若女子不肯跟你来、我使你起的誓就与你无干了、只是不可带我的儿子回那里去。  
24:9 仆人就把手放在他主人亚伯拉罕的大腿底下、为这事向他起誓。  
24:10 那仆人从他主人的骆驼里取了十匹骆驼、并带些他主人各样的财物、起身往米所波大米去、到了拿鹤的城。  

24:11 天将晚、众女子出来打水的时候、他便叫骆驼跪在城外的水井那里。  
24:12 他说、耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的　神阿、求你施恩给我主人亚伯拉罕、使我今日遇见好机会。  
24:13 我现今站在井旁、城内居民的女子们正出来打水。  
24:14 我向那一个女子说、请你拿下水瓶来、给我水喝。他若说、请喝、我也给你的骆驼喝、愿那女子就作你所预定给你仆人以撒的妻、这样、我便知道你施恩给我主人了。  
24:15 话还没有说完、不料、利百加肩头上扛着水瓶出来、利百加是彼土利所生的、彼土利是亚伯拉罕兄弟拿鹤妻子密迦的儿子。  

24:16 那女子容貌极其俊美、还是处女、也未曾有人亲近他、他下到井旁打满了瓶、又上来。  
24:17 仆人跑上前去迎着他说、求你将瓶里的水给我一点喝。  
24:18 女子说、我主请喝。就急忙拿下瓶来、托在手上给他喝。  
24:19 女子给他喝了、就说、我再为你的骆驼打水、叫骆驼也喝足。  
24:20 他就急忙把瓶里的水倒在槽里、又跑到井旁打水、就为所有的骆驼打上水来。  

24:21 那人定睛看他、一句话也不说、要晓得耶和华赐他通达的道路没有。  
24:22 骆驼喝足了、那人就拿一个金环、重半舍客勒、两个金镯、重十舍客勒、给了那女子、  
24:23 说、请告诉我、你是谁的女儿、你父亲家里有我们住宿的地方没有。  
24:24 女子说、我是密迦与拿鹤之子彼土利的女儿。  
24:25 又说、我们家里足有粮草、也有住宿的地方。  

24:26 那人就低头向耶和华下拜、  
24:27 说、耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的　神是应当称颂的、因他不断的以慈爱诚实待我主人。至于我、耶和华在路上引领我、直走到我主人的兄弟家里。  
24:28 女子跑回去、照着这些话告诉他母亲和他家里的人。  
24:29 利百加有一个哥哥、名叫拉班、看见金环、又看见金镯在他妹子的手上、并听见他妹子利百加的话、说、那人对我如此如此说、拉班就跑出来往井旁去、到那人跟前、见他仍站在骆驼旁边的井旁那里。  
24:30 见上节

24:31 便对他说、你这蒙耶和华赐福的、请进来、为甚么站在外边、我已经收拾了房屋、也为骆驼预备了地方。  
24:32 那人就进了拉班的家。拉班卸了骆驼、用草料喂上、拿水给那人和跟随的人洗脚。  
24:33 把饭摆在他面前、叫他吃、他却说、我不吃、等我说明白我的事情再吃、拉班说、请说。  
24:34 他说、我是亚伯拉罕的仆人。  
24:35 耶和华大大地赐福给我主人、使他昌大。又赐给他羊群、牛群、金银、仆婢、骆驼、和驴。  

24:36 我主人的妻子撒拉年老的时候、给我主人生了一个儿子。我主人也将一切所有的都给了这个儿子。  
24:37 我主人叫我起誓说、你不要为我儿子娶迦南地的女子为妻。  
24:38 你要往我父家、我本族那里去、为我的儿子娶一个妻子。  
24:39 我对我主人说、恐怕女子不肯跟我来。  
24:40 他就说、我所事奉的耶和华必要差遣他的使者与你同去、叫你的道路通达。你就得以在我父家、我本族那里、给我的儿子娶一个妻子。  

24:41 只要你到了我本族那里、我使你起的誓、就与你无干、他们若不把女子交给你、我使你起的誓也与你无干。  
24:42 我今日到了井旁、便说、耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的　神阿、愿你叫我所行的道路通达。  
24:43 我如今站在井旁、对那一个出来打水的女子说、请你把你瓶里的水给我一点喝。  
24:44 他若说、你只管喝、我也为你的骆驼打水。愿那女子就作耶和华给我主人儿子所预定的妻。  
24:45 我心里的话还没有说完、利百加就出来、肩头上扛着水瓶、下到井旁打水。我便对他说、请你给我水喝。  

24:46 他就急忙从肩头上拿下瓶来、说、请喝、我也给你的骆驼喝。我便喝了。他又给我的骆驼喝了。  
24:47 我问他说、你是谁的女儿、他说、我是密迦与拿鹤之子彼土利的女儿、我就把环子戴在他鼻子上、把镯子戴在他两手上。  
24:48 随后我低头向耶和华下拜、称颂耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的　神、因为他引导我走合式的道路、使我得着我主人兄弟的孙女、给我主人的儿子为妻。  
24:49 现在你们若愿以慈爱诚实待我主人、就告诉我。若不然、也告诉我、使我可以或向左、或向右。  
24:50 拉班和彼土利回答说、这事乃出于耶和华、我们不能向你说好说歹。  

24:51 看哪、利百加在你面前、可以将他带去、照着耶和华所说的、给你主人的儿子为妻。  
24:52 亚伯拉罕的仆人听见他们这话、就向耶和华俯伏在地。  
24:53 当下仆人拿出金器、银器、和衣服送给利百加、又将宝物送给他哥哥、和他母亲。  
24:54 仆人和跟从他的人、吃了喝了、住了一夜、早晨起来、仆人就说、请打发我回我主人那里去吧。  
24:55 利百加的哥哥和他母亲说、让女子同我们再住几天、至少十天、然后他可以去。  

24:56 仆人说、耶和华既赐给我通达的道路、你们不要耽误我、请打发我走、回我主人那里去吧。  
24:57 他们说、我们把女子叫来问问他、  
24:58 就叫了利百加来、问他说、你和这人同去么、利百加说、我去。  
24:59 于是他们打发妹子利百加和他的乳母、同亚伯拉罕的仆人、并跟从仆人的、都走了。  
24:60 他们就给利百加祝福、说、我们的妹子阿、愿你作千万人的母、愿你的后裔、得着仇敌的城门。  

24:61 利百加和他的使女们起来、骑上骆驼、跟着那仆人。仆人就带着利百加走了。  
24:62 那时、以撒住在南地、刚从庇耳拉海莱回来。  
24:63 天将晚、以撒出来在田间默想。举目一看、见来了些骆驼。  
24:64 利百加举目看见以撒、就急忙下了骆驼。  
24:65 问那仆人说、这田间走来迎接我们的是谁、仆人说、是我的主人。利百加就拿帕子蒙上脸。  

24:66 仆人就将所办的一切事、都告诉以撒。  
24:67 以撒便领利百加进了他母亲撒拉的帐棚、娶了他为妻。并且爱他。以撒自从他母亲不在了、这才得了安慰。

25:2 基土拉给他生了心兰、约珊、米但、米甸、伊施巴、和书亚。  
25:3 约珊生了示巴、和底但。底但的子孙、是亚书利族、利都是族、和利乌米族。

25:7 亚伯拉罕一生的年日、是一百七十五岁。  
25:8 亚伯拉罕寿高年迈、气绝而死、归到他列祖〔原文作本民〕那里。  
25:9 他两个儿子以撒、以实玛利、把他埋葬在麦比拉洞里。这洞在幔利前、赫人琐辖的儿子以弗仑的田中、  
25:10 就是亚伯拉罕向赫人买的那块田。亚伯拉罕和他妻子撒拉、都葬在那里。  

25:11 亚伯拉罕死了以后、　神赐福给他的儿子以撒。以撒靠近庇耳拉海莱居住。  
25:12 撒拉的使女埃及人夏甲、给亚伯拉罕所生的儿子、是以实玛利。  
25:13 以实玛利儿子们的名字、按着他们的家谱、记在下面。以实玛利的长子是尼拜约、又有基达、亚德别、米比衫、

25:17 以实玛利享寿一百三十七岁、气绝而死、归到他列祖〔原文作本民〕那里。  
25:18 他子孙的住处在他众弟兄东边、从哈腓拉直到埃及前的书珥、正在亚述的道上。  
25:19 亚伯拉罕的儿子以撒的后代、记在下面。亚伯拉罕生以撒、  
25:20 以撒娶利百加为妻的时候、正四十岁。利百加是巴旦亚兰地的亚兰人、彼土利的女儿、是亚兰人拉班的妹子。  

25:21 以撒因他妻子不生育、就为他祈求耶和华、耶和华应允他的祈求、他的妻子利百加就怀了孕。  
25:22 孩子们在他腹中彼此相争、他就说、若是这样、我为甚么活着呢。〔或作我为甚么如此呢〕他就去求问耶和华。  
25:23 耶和华对他说、两国在你腹内、两族要从你身上出来、这族必强于那族、将来大的要服事小的。  
25:24 生产的日子到了、腹中果然是双子。  
25:25 先产的身体发红、浑身有毛、如同皮衣。他们就给他起名叫以扫。〔以扫就是有毛的意思〕  

25:26 随后又生了以扫的兄弟、手抓住以扫的脚跟、因此给他起名叫雅各。〔雅各就是抓住的意思〕利百加生下两个儿子的时候、以撒年正六十岁。  
25:27 两个孩子渐渐长大、以扫善于打猎、常在田野。雅各为人安静、常住在帐棚里。  
25:28 以撒爱以扫、因为常吃他的野味。利百加却爱雅各。  
25:29 有一天、雅各熬汤、以扫从田野回来累昏了。  
25:30 以扫对雅各说、我累昏了、求你把这红汤给我喝。因此以扫又叫以东。〔以东就是红的意思〕  

25:31 雅各说、你今日把长子的名分卖给我吧。  
25:32 以扫说、我将要死、这长子的名分于我有甚么益处呢。  
25:33 雅各说、你今日对我起誓吧。以扫就对他起了誓、把长子的名分卖给雅各。  
25:34 于是雅各将饼和红豆汤给了以扫、以扫吃了喝了、便起来走了。这就是以扫轻看了他长子的名分。

26:1 在亚伯拉罕的日子、那地有一次饥荒。这时又有饥荒、以撒就往基拉耳去、到非利士人的王亚比米勒那里。  
26:2 耶和华向以撒显现、说、你不要下埃及去、要住在我所指示你的地。  
26:3 你寄居在这地、我必与你同在、赐福给你、因为我要将这些地都赐给你和你的后裔、我必坚定我向你父亚伯拉罕所起的誓。  
26:4 我要加增你的后裔、像天上的星那样多。又要将这些地都赐给你的后裔。并且地上万国必因你的后裔得福。  
26:5 都因亚伯拉罕听从我的话、遵守我的吩咐、和我的命令、律例、法度。  

26:6 以撒就住在基拉耳。  
26:7 那地方的人问到他的妻子、他便说、那是我的妹子。原来他怕说、是我的妻子。他心里想、恐怕这地方的人、为利百加的缘故杀我、因为他容貌俊美。  
26:8 他在那里住了许久。有一天非利士人的王亚比米勒、从窗户里往外观看、见以撒和他的妻子利百加戏玩。  
26:9 亚比米勒召了以撒来、对他说、他实在是你的妻子。你怎么说、他是你的妹子。以撒说、我心里想、恐怕我因他而死。  
26:10 亚比米勒说、你向我们作的是甚么事呢、民中险些有人和你的妻同寝、把我们陷在罪里。  

26:11 于是亚比米勒晓谕众民说、凡沾着这个人、或是他妻子的、定要把他治死。  
26:12 以撒在那地耕种、那一年有百倍的收成。耶和华赐福给他。  
26:13 他就昌大、日增月盛、成了大富户。  
26:14 他有羊群、牛群、又有许多仆人。非利士人就嫉妒他。  
26:15 当他父亲亚伯拉罕在世的日子、他父亲的仆人所挖的井、非利士人全都塞住、填满了土。  

26:16 亚比米勒对以撒说、你离开我们去吧、因为你比我们强盛得多。  
26:17 以撒就离开那里、在基拉耳谷支搭帐棚、住在那里。  
26:18 当他父亲亚伯拉罕在世之日所挖的水井、因非利士人在亚伯拉罕死后塞住了、以撒就重新挖出来、仍照他父亲所叫的、叫那些井的名字。  
26:19 以撒的仆人在谷中挖井、便得了一口活水井。  
26:20 基拉耳的牧人与以撒的牧人争竞、说、这水是我们的。以撒就给那井起名叫埃色、因为他们和他相争。〔埃色就是相争的意思〕  

26:21 以撒的仆人又挖了一口井、他们又为这井争竞、因此以撒给这井起名叫西提拿。〔西提拿就是为敌的意思〕  
26:22 以撒离开那里、又挖了一口井、他们不为这井争竞了、他就给那井起名叫利河伯。〔就是宽阔的意思〕他说、耶和华现在给我们宽阔之地、我们必在这地昌盛。  
26:23 以撒从那里上别是巴去。  
26:24 当夜耶和华向他显现、说、我是你父亲亚伯拉罕的　神、不要惧怕、因为我与你同在、要赐福给你、并要为我仆人亚伯拉罕的缘故、使你的后裔繁多。  
26:25 以撒就在那里筑了一座坛、求告耶和华的名、并且支搭帐棚。他的仆人便在那里挖了一口井。  

26:26 亚比米勒、同他的朋友亚户撒、和他的军长非各、从基拉耳来见以撒。  
26:27 以撒对他们说、你们既然恨我、打发我走了、为甚么到我这里来呢。  
26:28 他们说、我们明明的看见耶和华与你同在、便说、不如我们两下彼此起誓、彼此立约。  
26:29 使你不害我们、正如我们未曾害你、一味的厚待你、并且打发你平平安安的走。你是蒙耶和华赐福的了。  
26:30 以撒就为他们设摆筵席、他们便吃了喝了。  

26:31 他们清早起来彼此起誓。以撒打发他们走、他们就平平安安的离开他走了。  
26:32 那一天以撒的仆人来、将挖井的事告诉他、说、我们得了水了。  
26:33 他就给那井起名叫示巴。因此那城叫作别是巴、直到今日。  
26:34 以扫四十岁的时候、娶了赫人比利的女儿犹滴、与赫人以伦的女儿巴实抹为妻。  
26:35 他们常使以撒和利百加心里愁烦。

27:1 以撒年老、眼睛昏花、不能看见、就叫了他大儿子以扫来、说、我儿、以扫说、我在这里。  
27:2 他说、我如今老了、不知道那一天死。  
27:3 现在拿你的器械、就是箭囊、和弓、往田野去为我打猎。  
27:4 照我所爱的作成美味、拿来给我吃、使我在未死之先、给你祝福。  
27:5 以撒对他儿子以扫说话、利百加也听见了。以扫往田野去打猎、要得野味带来。  

27:6 利百加就对他儿子雅各说、我听见你父亲对你哥哥以扫说、  
27:7 你去把野兽带来、作成美味给我吃、我好在未死之先、在耶和华面前给你祝福。』
27:8 现在我儿、你要照着我所吩咐你的、听从我的话。  
27:9 你到羊群里去、给我拿两只肥山羊羔来、我便照你父亲所爱的、给他作成美味。  
27:10 你拿到你父亲那里给他吃、使他在未死之先、给你祝福。  

27:11 雅各对他母亲利百加说、我哥哥以扫浑身是有毛的、我身上是光滑的。  
27:12 倘若我父亲摸着我、必以我为欺哄人的、我就招咒诅、不得祝福。  
27:13 他母亲对他说、我儿、你招的咒诅归到我身上、你只管听我的话、去把羊羔给我拿来。  
27:14 他便去拿来、交给他母亲、他母亲就照他父亲所爱的、作成美味。  
27:15 利百加又把家里所存大儿子以扫上好的衣服、给他小儿子雅各穿上。  

27:16 又用山羊羔皮、包在雅各的手上、和颈项的光滑处。  
27:17 就把所作的美味和饼、交在他儿子雅各的手里。  
27:18 雅各到他父亲那里说、我父亲、他说、我在这里、我儿、你是谁。  
27:19 雅各对他父亲说、我是你的长子以扫、我已照你所吩咐我的行了。请起来坐着、吃我的野味、好给我祝福。  
27:20 以撒对他儿子说、我儿、你如何找得这么快呢。他说、因为耶和华你的　神使我遇见好机会得着的。  

27:21 以撒对雅各说、我儿、你近前来、我摸摸你、知道你真是我的儿子以扫不是。  
27:22 雅各就挨近他父亲以撒。以撒摸着他说、声音是雅各的声音、手却是以扫的手。  
27:23 以撒就辨不出他来、因为他手上有毛、像他哥哥以扫的手一样、就给他祝福。  
27:24 又说、你真是我儿子以扫么、他说、我是。  
27:25 以撒说、你递给我、我好吃我儿子的野味、给你祝福。雅各就递给他、他便吃了。又拿酒给他、他也喝了。  

27:26 他父亲以撒对他说、我儿、你上前来与我亲嘴。  
27:27 他就上前与父亲亲嘴。他父亲一闻他衣服上的香气、就给他祝福、说、我儿的香气如同耶和华赐福之田地的香气一样。  
27:28 愿　神赐你天上的甘露、地上的肥土、并许多五谷新酒。  
27:29 愿多民事奉你、多国跪拜你。愿你作你弟兄的主、你母亲的儿子向你跪拜。凡咒诅你的、愿他受咒诅。为你祝福的、愿他蒙福。  
27:30 以撒为雅各祝福已毕、雅各从他父亲那里才出来、他哥哥以扫正打猎回来。  

27:31 也作了美味、拿来给他父亲、说、请父亲起来、吃你儿子的野味、好给我祝福。  
27:32 他父亲以撒对他说、你是谁、他说、我是你的长子以扫。  
27:33 以撒就大大的战兢、说、你未来之先、是谁得了野味拿来给我呢、我已经吃了、为他祝福、他将来也必蒙福。  
27:34 以扫听了他父亲的话、就放声痛哭、说、我父阿、求你也为我祝福。  
27:35 以撒说、你兄弟已经用诡计来将你的福分夺去了。  

27:36 以扫说、他名雅各岂不是正对么。因为他欺骗了我两次、他从前夺了我长子的名分、你看、他现在又夺了我的福分。以扫又说、你没有留下为我可祝的福么。  
27:37 以撒回答以扫说、我已立他为你的主、使他的弟兄都给他作仆人、并赐他五谷新酒可以养生、我儿、现在我还能为你作甚么呢。  
27:38 以扫对他父亲说、父阿、你只有一样可祝的福么、我父阿、求你也为我祝福。以扫就放声而哭。  
27:39 他父亲以撒说、地上的肥土必为你所住、天上的甘露必为你所得。  
27:40 你必倚靠刀剑度日、又必事奉你的兄弟、到你强盛的时候、必从你颈项上挣开他的轭。  

27:41 以扫因他父亲给雅各祝的福、就怨恨雅各、心里说、为我父亲居丧的日子近了、到那时候、我要杀我的兄弟雅各。  
27:42 有人把利百加大儿子以扫的话告诉利百加、他就打发人去、叫了他小儿子雅各来、对他说、你哥哥以扫想要杀你、报仇雪恨。  
27:43 现在我儿、你要听我的话、起来逃往哈兰我哥哥拉班那里去。  
27:44 同他住些日子、直等你哥哥的怒气消了。  
27:45 你哥哥向你消了怒气、忘了你向他所作的事、我便打发人去把你从那里带回来。为甚么一日丧你们二人呢。  

27:46 利百加对以撒说、我因这赫人的女子、连性命都厌烦了。倘若雅各也娶赫人的女子为妻、像这些一样、我活着还有甚么益处呢。

创世纪 28章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

28:1 以撒叫了雅各来、给他祝福。并嘱咐他说、你不要娶迦南的女子为妻。  
28:2 你起身往巴旦亚兰去、到你外祖彼土利家里、在你母舅拉班的女儿中、娶一女为妻。  
28:3 愿全能的　神赐福给你、使你生养众多、成为多族、  
28:4 将应许亚伯拉罕的福赐给你、和你的后裔、使你承受你所寄居的地为业、就是　神赐给亚伯拉罕的地。  
28:5 以撒打发雅各走了、他就往巴旦亚兰去、到亚兰人彼土利的儿子拉班那里。拉班是雅各以扫的母舅。  

28:6 以扫见以撒已经给雅各祝福、而且打发他往巴旦亚兰去、在那里娶妻、并见祝福的时候嘱咐他说、不要娶迦南的女子为妻。  
28:7 又见雅各听从父母的话、往巴旦亚兰去了。  
28:8 以扫就晓得他父亲以撒看不中迦南的女子、  
28:9 便往以实玛利那里去、在他二妻之外、又娶了玛哈拉为妻。他是亚伯拉罕儿子以实玛利的女儿、尼拜约的妹子。  
28:10 雅各出了别是巴向哈兰走去。  

28:11 到了一个地方、因为太阳落了、就在那里住宿。便拾起那地方的一块石头、枕在头下、在那里躺卧睡了。  
28:12 梦见一个梯子立在地上、梯子的头顶着天、有　神的使者在梯子上、上去下来。  
28:13 耶和华站在梯子以上、〔或作站在他旁边〕说、我是耶和华你祖亚伯拉罕的　神、也是以撒的　神、我要将你现在所躺卧之地赐给你、和你的后裔。  
28:14 你的后裔必像地上的尘沙那样多、必向东西南北开展。地上万族必因你和你的后裔得福。  
28:15 我也与你同在、你无论往那里去、我必保佑你、领你归回这地、总不离弃你、直到我成全了向你所应许的。  

28:16 雅各睡醒了、说、耶和华真在这里、我竟不知道。  
28:17 就惧怕说、这地方何等可畏、这不是别的、乃是　神的殿、也是天的门。  
28:18 雅各清早起来、把所枕的石头立作柱子、浇油在上面。  
28:19 他就给那地方起名、叫伯特利。〔就是　神殿的意思〕但那地方起先名叫路斯。  
28:20 雅各许愿、说、　神若与我同在、在我所行的路上保佑我、又给我食物吃、衣服穿、  

28:21 使我平平安安的回到我父亲的家、我就必以耶和华为我的　神、  
28:22 我所立为柱子的石头、也必作　神的殿。凡你所赐给我的、我必将十分之一献给你。

创世纪 29章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35

29:1 雅各起行、到了东方人之地。  
29:2 看见田间有一口井、有三群羊卧在井旁。因为人饮羊群、都是用那井里的水。井口上的石头是大的。  
29:3 常有羊群在那里聚集。牧人把石头转离井口饮羊、随后又把石头放在井口的原处。  
29:4 雅各对牧人说、弟兄们、你们是那里来的。他们说、我们是哈兰来的。  
29:5 他问他们说、拿鹤的孙子拉班、你们认识么。他们说、我们认识。  

29:6 雅各说、他平安么。他们说、平安。看哪、他女儿拉结领着羊来了。  
29:7 雅各说、日头还高、不是羊群聚集的时候、你们不如饮羊再去放一放。  
29:8 他们说、我们不能、必等羊群聚齐、人把石头转离井口、才可饮羊。  
29:9 雅各正和他们说话的时候、拉结领着他父亲的羊来了、因为那些羊是他牧放的。  
29:10 雅各看见母舅拉班的女儿拉结、和母舅拉班的羊群、就上前把石头转离井口、饮他母舅拉班的羊群。  

29:11 雅各与拉结亲嘴、就放声而哭。  
29:12 雅各告诉拉结自己是他父亲的外甥、是利百加的儿子。拉结就跑去告诉他父亲。  
29:13 拉班听见外甥雅各的信息、就跑去迎接、抱着他与他亲嘴、领他到自己的家。雅各将一切的情由告诉拉班。  
29:14 拉班对他说、你实在是我的骨肉。雅各就和他同住了一个月。  
29:15 拉班对雅各说、你虽是我的骨肉、〔原文作弟兄〕岂可白白的服事我、请告诉我你要甚么为工价。  

29:16 拉班有两个女儿、大的名叫利亚、小的名叫拉结。  
29:17 利亚的眼睛没有神气、拉结却生得美貌俊秀。  
29:18 雅各爱拉结、就说、我愿为你小女儿拉结服事你七年。  
29:19 拉班说、我把他给你、胜似给别人、你与我同住吧。  
29:20 雅各就为拉结服事了七年。他因为深爱拉结、就看这七年如同几天。  

29:21 雅各对拉班说、日期已经满了、求你把我的妻子给我、我好与他同房。  
29:22 拉班就摆设筵席、请齐了那地方的众人。  
29:23 到晚上、拉班将女儿利亚送来给雅各、雅各就与他同房。  
29:24 拉班又将婢女悉帕给女儿利亚作使女。  
29:25 到了早晨、雅各一看是利亚、就对拉班说、你向我作的是甚么事呢。我服事你、不是为拉结么。你为甚么欺哄我呢。  

29:26 拉班说、大女儿还没有给人、先把小女儿给人、在我们这地方没有这规矩。  
29:27 你为这个满了七日、我就把那个也给你、你再为他服事我七年。  
29:28 雅各就如此行。满了利亚的七日、拉班便将女儿拉结给雅各为妻。  
29:29 拉班又将婢女辟拉给女儿拉结作使女。  
29:30 雅各也与拉结同房、并且爱拉结胜似爱利亚。于是又服事了拉班七年。  

29:31 耶和华见利亚失宠、〔原文作被恨下同〕就使他生育。拉结却不生育。  
29:32 利亚怀孕生子、就给他起名叫流便、〔就是有儿子的意思〕因而说、耶和华看见我的苦情、如今我的丈夫必爱我。  
29:33 他又怀孕生子、就说、耶和华因为听见我失宠、所以又赐给我这个儿子。于是给他起名叫西缅。〔就是听见的意思〕  
29:34 他又怀孕生子、起名叫利未、〔就是联合的意思〕说、我给丈夫生了三个儿子、他必与我联合。  
29:35 他又怀孕生子、说、这回我要赞美耶和华、因此给他起名叫犹大。〔就是赞美的意思〕这才停了生育。

创世纪 30章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43

30:1 拉结见自己不给雅各生子、就嫉妒他姐姐、对雅各说、你给我孩子、不然我就死了。  
30:2 雅各向拉结生气、说、叫你不生育的是　神、我岂能代替他作主呢。  
30:3 拉结说、有我的使女辟拉在这里、你可以与他同房、使他生子在我膝下、我便因他也得孩子。〔得孩子原文作被建立〕  
30:4 拉结就把他的使女辟拉给丈夫为妾、雅各便与他同房。  
30:5 辟拉就怀孕给雅各生了一个儿子。  

30:6 拉结说、　神伸了我的冤、也听了我的声音、赐我一个儿子、因此给他起名叫但。〔就是伸冤的意思〕  
30:7 拉结的使女辟拉又怀孕、给雅各生了第二个儿子。  
30:8 拉结说、我与我姐姐大大相争、并且得胜。于是给他起名叫拿弗他利。〔就是相争的意思〕  
30:9 利亚见自己停了生育、就把使女悉帕给雅各为妾。  
30:10 利亚的使女悉帕给雅各生了一个儿子。  

30:11 利亚说、万幸、于是给他起名叫迦得。〔就是万幸的意思〕  
30:12 利亚的使女悉帕又给雅各生了第二个儿子。  
30:13 利亚说、我有福阿、众女子都要称我是有福的。于是给他起名叫亚设。〔就是有福的意思〕  
30:14 割麦子的时候、流便往田里去寻见风茄、拿来给他母亲利亚。拉结对利亚说、请你把你儿子的风茄给我些。  
30:15 利亚说、你夺了我的丈夫还算小事么、你又要夺我儿子的风茄么。拉结说、为你儿子的风茄、今夜他可以与你同寝。  

30:16 到了晚上、雅各从田里回来、利亚出来迎接他、说、你要与我同寝、因为我实在用我儿子的风茄、把你雇下了。那一夜雅各就与他同寝。  
30:17 　神应允了利亚、他就怀孕、给雅各生了第五个儿子。  
30:18 利亚说、　神给了我价值、因为我把使女给了我丈夫。于是给他起名叫以萨迦。〔就是价值的意思〕  
30:19 利亚又怀孕、给雅各生了第六个儿子。  
30:20 利亚说、　神赐我厚赏、我丈夫必与我同住、因我给他生了六个儿子。于是给他起名西布伦。〔就是同住的意思〕  

30:21 后来又生了一个女儿、给他起名叫底拿。  
30:22 　神顾念拉结、应允了他、使他能生育。  
30:23 拉结怀孕生子、说、　神除去了我的羞耻。  
30:24 就给他起名叫约瑟、〔就是增添的意思〕意思说、愿耶和华再增添我一个儿子。  
30:25 拉结生约瑟之后、雅各对拉班说、请打发我走、叫我回到我本乡本土去。  

30:26 请你把我服事你所得的妻子、和儿女给我、让我走。我怎样服事你、你都知道。  
30:27 拉班对他说、我若在你眼前蒙恩、请你仍与我同住、因为我已算定、耶和华赐福与我、是为你的缘故。  
30:28 又说、请你定你的工价、我就给你。  
30:29 雅各对他说、我怎样服事你、你的牲畜在我手里怎样、是你知道的。  
30:30 我未来之先、你所有的很少、现今却发大众多、耶和华随我的脚步赐福与你。如今、我甚么时候才为自己兴家立业呢。  

30:31 拉班说、我当给你甚么呢。雅各说、甚么你也不必给我、只有一件事、你若应承、我便仍旧牧放你的羊群。  
30:32 今天我要走遍你的羊群、把绵羊中凡有点的、有斑的、和黑色的、并山羊中凡有斑的、有点的、都挑出来、将来这一等的、就算我的工价。  
30:33 以后你来查看我的工价、凡在我手里的山羊不是有点有斑的、绵羊不是黑色的、那就算是我偷的。这样、便可证出我的公义来。  
30:34 拉班说、好阿。我情愿照着你的话行。  
30:35 当日拉班把有纹的、有斑的公山羊、有点的、有斑的、有杂白纹的母山羊、并黑色的绵羊、都挑出来、交在他儿子们的手下。  

30:36 又使自己和雅各相离三天的路程。雅各就牧养拉班其余的羊。  
30:37 雅各拿杨树、杏树、枫树的嫩枝、将皮剥成白纹、使枝子露出白的来。  
30:38 将剥了皮的枝子、对着羊群插在饮羊的水沟里、和水槽里、羊来喝的时候牝牡配合。  
30:39 羊对着枝子配合、就生下有纹的、有点的、有斑的来。  
30:40 雅各把羊羔分出来、使拉班的羊、与这有纹和黑色的羊相对、把自己的羊另放一处、不叫他和拉班的羊混杂。  

30:41 到羊群肥壮配合的时候、雅各就把枝子插在水沟里、使羊对着枝子配合。  
30:42 只是到羊瘦弱配合的时候、就不插枝子。这样、瘦弱的就归拉班、肥壮的就归雅各。  
30:43 于是雅各极其发大、得了许多的羊群、仆婢、骆驼、和驴。

31:1 雅各听见拉班的儿子们有话说、雅各把我们父亲所有的都夺了去、并借着我们父亲的、得了这一切的荣耀。〔荣耀或作财〕  
31:2 雅各见拉班的气色向他不如从前了。  
31:3 耶和华对雅各说、你要回你祖你父之地、到你亲族那里去、我必与你同在。  
31:4 雅各就打发人、叫拉结和利亚到田野羊群那里来。  
31:5 对他们说、我看你们父亲的气色向我不如从前了。但我父亲的　神向来与我同在。  

31:6 你们也知道、我尽了我的力量服事你们的父亲。  
31:7 你们的父亲欺哄我、十次改了我的工价。然而　神不容他害我。  
31:8 他若说、有点的归你作工价、羊群所生的都有点。他若说、有纹的归你作工价、羊群所生的都有纹。  
31:9 这样、　神把你们父亲的牲畜夺来赐给我了。  
31:10 羊配合的时候、我梦中举目一看、见跳母羊的公羊、都是有纹的、有点的、有花斑的。  

31:11 　神的使者在那梦中呼叫我说、雅各。我说、我在这里。  
31:12 他说、你举目观看、跳母羊的公羊都是有纹的、有点的、有花斑的。凡拉班向你所作的、我都看见了。  
31:13 我是伯特利的　神。你在那里用油浇过柱子、向我许过愿。现今你起来离开这地、回你本地去吧。  
31:14 拉结和利亚回答雅各说、在我们父亲的家里还有我们可得的分么、还有我们的产业么。  
31:15 我们不是被他当作外人么。因为他卖了我们、吞了我们的价值。  

31:16 　神从我们父亲所夺出来的一切财物、那就是我们、和我们孩子们的。现今凡　神所吩咐你的、你只管去行吧。  
31:17 雅各起来、使他的儿子和妻子都骑上骆驼。  
31:18 又带着他在巴旦亚兰所得的一切牲畜和财物、往迦南地、他父亲以撒那里去了。  
31:19 当时拉班剪羊毛去了。拉结偷了他父亲家中的神像。  
31:20 雅各背着亚兰人拉班偷走了、并不告诉他。  

31:21 就带着所有的逃跑。他起身过大河、面向基列山行去。  
31:22 到第三日、有人告诉拉班、雅各逃跑了。  
31:23 拉班带领他的众弟兄去追赶、追了七日、在基列山就追上了。  
31:24 夜间　神到亚兰人拉班那里、在梦中对他说、你要小心、不可与雅各说好说歹。  
31:25 拉班追上雅各、雅各在山上支搭帐棚。拉班和他的众弟兄、也在基列山上支搭帐棚。  

31:26 拉班对雅各说、你作的是甚么事呢、你背着我偷走了、又把我的女儿们带了去、如同用刀剑掳去的一般。  
31:27 你为甚么暗暗的逃跑、偷着走、并不告诉我、叫我可以欢乐、唱歌、击鼓、弹琴的送你回去。  
31:28 又不容我与外孙和女儿亲嘴。你所行的真是愚昧。  
31:29 我手中原有能力害你、只是你父亲的　神昨夜对我说、你要小心、不可与雅各说好说歹。  
31:30 现在你虽然想你父家、不得不去、为甚么又偷了我的神像呢。  

31:31 雅各回答拉班说、恐怕你把你的女儿从我夺去、所以我逃跑。  
31:32 至于你的神像、你在谁那里搜出来、就不容谁存活。当着我们的众弟兄你认一认、在我这里有甚么东西是你的、就拿去。原来雅各不知道拉结偷了那些神像。  
31:33 拉班进了雅各、利亚、并两个使女的帐棚、都没有搜出来。就从利亚的帐棚出来、进了拉结的帐棚。  
31:34 拉结已经把神像藏在骆驼的驮篓里、便坐在上头、拉班摸遍了那帐棚、并没有摸着。  
31:35 拉结对他父亲说、现在我身上不便、不能在你面前起来、求我主不要生气。这样、拉班搜寻神像、竟没有搜出来。  

31:36 雅各就发怒斥责拉班说、我有甚么过犯、有甚么罪恶、你竟这样火速的追我。  
31:37 你摸遍了我一切的家具、你搜出甚么来呢、可以放在你我弟兄面前、叫他们在你我中间辨别辨别。  
31:38 我在你家这二十年、你的母绵羊、母山羊、没有掉过胎。你群中的公羊、我没有吃过。  
31:39 被野兽撕裂的、我没有带来给你、是我自己赔上、无论是白日、是黑夜、被偷去的、你都向我索要。  
31:40 我白日受尽干热、黑夜受尽寒霜、不得合眼睡着、我常是这样。  

31:41 我这二十年在你家里、为你的两个女儿服事你十四年、为你的羊群服事你六年、你又十次改了我的工价。  
31:42 若不是我父亲以撒所敬畏的　神、就是亚伯拉罕的　神与我同在、你如今必定打发我空手而去。　神看见我的苦情、和我的劳碌、就在昨夜责备你。  
31:43 拉班回答雅各说、这女儿是我的女儿、这些孩子是我的孩子、这些羊群也是我的羊群、凡在你眼前的都是我的。我的女儿、并他们所生的孩子、我今日能向他们作甚么呢。  
31:44 来吧、你我二人可以立约、作你我中间的证据。  
31:45 雅各就拿一块石头立作柱子。  

31:46 又对众弟兄说、你们堆聚石头。他们就拿石头来堆成一堆、大家便在旁边吃喝。  
31:47 拉班称那石堆为伊迦尔撒哈杜他、雅各却称那石堆为迦累得。〔都是以石堆为证的意思〕  
31:48 拉班说、今日这石堆作你我中间的证据。因此这地方名叫迦累得、  
31:49 又叫米斯巴、意思说、我们彼此离别以后、愿耶和华在你我中间鉴察。  
31:50 你若苦待我的女儿、又在我的女儿以外另娶妻、虽没有人知道、却有　神在你我中间作见证。  

31:51 拉班又说、你看我在你我中间所立的这石堆、和柱子。  
31:52 这石堆作证据、这柱子也作证据、我必不过这石堆去害你、你也不可过这石堆和柱子、来害我。  
31:53 但愿亚伯拉罕的　神、和拿鹤的　神、就是他们父亲的　神、在你我中间判断。雅各就指着他父亲以撒所敬畏的　神起誓。  
31:54 又在山上献祭、请众弟兄来吃饭。他们吃了饭、便在山上住宿。  
31:55 拉班清早起来、与他外孙和女儿亲嘴、给他们祝福、回往自己的地方去了。

32:1 雅各仍旧行路、　神的使者遇见他。  
32:2 雅各看见他们就说、这是　神的军兵。于是给那地方起名叫玛哈念。〔就是二军兵的意思〕  
32:3 雅各打发人先往西珥地去、就是以东地、见他哥哥以扫。  
32:4 吩咐他们说、你们对我主以扫说、你的仆人雅各这样说、我在拉班那里寄居、直到如今。  
32:5 我有牛、驴、羊群、仆婢、现在打发人来报告我主、为要在你眼前蒙恩。  

32:6 所打发的人回到雅各那里说、我们到了你哥哥以扫那里、他带着四百人、正迎着你来。  
32:7 雅各就甚惧怕、而且愁烦、便把那与他同在的人口、和羊群、牛群、骆驼、分作两队。  
32:8 说、以扫若来击杀这一队、剩下的那一队还可以逃避。  
32:9 雅各说、耶和华我祖亚伯拉罕的　神、我父亲以撒的　神阿、你曾对我说、回你本地本族去、我要厚待你。  
32:10 你向仆人所施的一切慈爱和诚实、我一点也不配得。我先前只拿着我的杖过这约但河、如今我却成了两队了。  

32:11 求你救我脱离我哥哥以扫的手、因为我怕他来杀我、连妻子带儿女一同杀了。  
32:12 你曾说、我必定厚待你、使你的后裔如同海边的沙、多得不可胜数。  
32:13 当夜雅各在那里住宿、就从他所有的物中拿礼物、要送给他哥哥以扫。  
32:14 母山羊二百只、公山羊二十只、母绵羊二百只、公绵羊二十只、  
32:15 奶崽子的骆驼三十只、各带着崽子、母牛四十只、公牛十只、母驴二十匹、驴驹十匹。  

32:16 每样各分一群、交在仆人手下、就对仆人说、你们要在我前头过去、使群群相离有空闲的地方。  
32:17 又吩咐尽先走的说、我哥哥以扫遇见你的时候、问你说、你是那家的人、要往那里去、你前头这些是谁的。  
32:18 你就说、是你仆人雅各的、是送给我主以扫的礼物、他自己也在我们后边。  
32:19 又吩咐第二、第三、和一切赶群畜的人说、你们遇见以扫的时候、也要这样对他说。  
32:20 并且你们要说、你仆人雅各在我们后边。因雅各心里说、我借着在我前头去的礼物解他的恨、然后再见他的面、或者他容纳我。  

32:21 于是礼物先过去了。那夜雅各在队中住宿。  
32:22 他夜间起来、带着两个妻子、两个使女、并十一个儿子都过了雅博渡口。  
32:23 先打发他们过河、又打发所有的都过去。  
32:24 只剩下雅各一人。有一个人来和他摔跤、直到黎明。  
32:25 那人见自己胜不过他、就将他的大腿窝摸了一把、雅各的大腿窝、正在摔跤的时候就扭了。  

32:26 那人说、天黎明了、容我去吧。雅各说、你不给我祝福、我就不容你去。  
32:27 那人说、你名叫甚么、他说、我名叫雅各。  
32:28 那人说、你的名不要再叫雅各、要叫以色列、因为你与　神与人较力、都得了胜。  
32:29 雅各问他说、请将你的名告诉我。那人说、何必问我的名。于是在那里给雅各祝福。  
32:30 雅各便给那地方起名叫毗努伊勒。〔就是　神之面的意思〕意思说、我面对面见了　神、我的性命仍得保全。  

32:31 日头刚出来的时候、雅各经过毗努伊勒、他的大腿就瘸了。  
32:32 故此以色列人不吃大腿窝的筋、直到今日、因为那人摸了雅各大腿窝的筋。

创世纪 33章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

33:1 雅各举目观看、见以扫来了、后头跟着四百人。他就把孩子们分开交给利亚、拉结、和两个使女。  
33:2 并且叫两个使女和他们的孩子在前头、利亚和他的孩子在后头、拉结和约瑟在尽后头。  
33:3 他自己在他们前头过去、一连七次俯伏在地、才就近他哥哥。  
33:4 以扫跑来迎接他、将他抱住、又搂着他的颈项与他亲嘴、两个人就哭了。  
33:5 以扫举目看见妇人孩子、就说、这些和你同行的是谁呢。雅各说、这些孩子是　神施恩给你的仆人的。  

33:6 于是两个使女和他们的孩子前来下拜。  
33:7 利亚和他的孩子也前来下拜。随后约瑟和拉结也前来下拜。  
33:8 以扫说、我所遇见的这些群畜是甚么意思呢。雅各说、是要在我主面前蒙恩的。  
33:9 以扫说、兄弟阿、我的已经够了、你的仍归你吧。  
33:10 雅各说、不然、我若在你眼前蒙恩、就求你从我手里收下这礼物、因为我见了你的面、如同见了　神的面、并且你容纳了我。  

33:11 求你收下我带来给你的礼物、因为　神恩待我、使我充足。雅各再三的求他、他才收下了。  
33:12 以扫说、我们可以起身前往、我在你前头走。  
33:13 雅各对他说、我主知道孩子们年幼娇嫩、牛羊也正在乳养的时候、若是催赶一天、群畜都必死了。  
33:14 求我主在仆人前头走。我要量着在我面前群畜和孩子的力量慢慢的前行、直走到西珥我主那里。  
33:15 以扫说、容我把跟随我的人留几个在你这里。雅各说、何必呢、只要在我主眼前蒙恩就是了。  

33:16 于是以扫当日起行、回往西珥去了。  
33:17 雅各就往疏割去、在那里为自己盖造房屋、又为牲畜搭棚。因此那地方名叫疏割。〔就是棚的意思〕  
33:18 雅各从巴旦亚兰回来的时候、平平安安的到了迦南地的示剑城、在城东支搭帐棚。  
33:19 就用一百块银子向示剑的父亲哈抹的子孙、买了支帐棚的那块地。  
33:20 在那里筑了一座坛、起名叫伊利伊罗伊以色列。〔就是　神以色列　神的意思〕

创世纪 34章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31

34:1 利亚给雅各所生的女儿底拿出去、要见那地的女子们。  
34:2 那地的主希未人、哈抹的儿子示剑、看见他、就拉住他、与他行淫、玷辱他。  
34:3 示剑的心系恋雅各的女儿底拿、喜爱这女子、甜言蜜语的安慰他。  
34:4 示剑对他父亲哈抹说、求你为我聘这女子为妻。  
34:5 雅各听见示剑玷污了他的女儿底拿。那时他的儿子们正和群畜在田野、雅各就闭口不言、等他们回来。  

34:6 示剑的父亲哈抹出来见雅各、要和他商议。  
34:7 雅各的儿子们听见这事、就从田野回来、人人忿恨、十分恼怒、因示剑在以色列家作了丑事、与雅各的女儿行淫、这本是不该作的事。  
34:8 哈抹和他们商议说、我儿子示剑的心恋慕这女子、求你们将他给我的儿子为妻。  
34:9 你们与我们彼此结亲、你们可以把女儿给我们、也可以娶我们的女儿。  
34:10 你们与我们同住吧、这地都在你们面前、只管在此居住、作买卖、置产业。  

34:11 示剑对女儿的父亲和弟兄们说、但愿我在你们眼前蒙恩。你们向我要甚么我必给你们。  
34:12 任凭向我要多重的聘金和礼物、我必照你们所说的给你们、只要把女子给我为妻。  
34:13 雅各的儿子们、因为示剑玷污了他们的妹子底拿、就用诡诈的话回答示剑、和他父亲哈抹。  
34:14 对他们说、我们不能把我们的妹子给没有受割礼的人为妻、因为那是我们的羞辱。  
34:15 惟有一件才可以应允、若你们所有的男丁都受割礼、和我们一样、  

34:16 我们就把女儿给你们、也娶你们的女儿、我们便与你们同住、两下成为一样的人民。  
34:17 倘若你们不听从我们受割礼、我们就带着妹子走了。  
34:18 哈抹和他的儿子示剑喜欢这话。  
34:19 那少年人作这事并不迟延、因为他喜爱雅各的女儿。他在他父亲家中也是人最尊重的。  
34:20 哈抹和他儿子示剑到本城的门口、对本城的人说、  

34:21 这些人与我们和睦、不如许他们在这地居住作买卖。这地也宽阔、足可容下他们、我们可以娶他们的女儿为妻、也可以把我们的女儿嫁给他们。  
34:22 惟有一件事我们必须作、他们才肯应允、和我们同住、成为一样的人民、就是我们中间所有的男丁、都要受割礼、和他们一样。  
34:23 他们的群畜、货财、和一切的牲口、岂不都归我们么。只要依从他们、他们就与我们同住。  
34:24 凡从城门出入的人、就都听从哈抹和他儿子示剑的话、于是凡从城门出入的男丁、都受了割礼。  
34:25 到第三天、众人正在疼痛的时候、雅各的两个儿子、就是底拿的哥哥、西缅和利未、各拿刀剑、趁着众人想不到的时候、来到城中、把一切男丁都杀了。  

34:26 又用刀杀了哈抹和他儿子示剑、把底拿从示剑家里带出来、就走了。  
34:27 雅各的儿子们因为他们的妹子受了玷污、就来到被杀的人那里、掳掠那城、  
34:28 夺了他们的羊群、牛群、和驴、并城里田间所有的。  
34:29 又把他们一切货财、孩子、妇女、并各房中所有的、都掳掠去了。  
34:30 雅各对西缅和利未说、你们连累我、使我在这地的居民中、就是在迦南人、和比利洗人中、有了臭名、我的人丁既然稀少、他们必聚集来击杀我、我和全家的人、都必灭绝。  

34:31 他们说、他岂可待我们的妹子如同妓女么。

35:1 　神对雅各说、起来、上伯特利去、住在那里、要在那里筑一座坛给　神、就是你逃避你哥哥以扫的时候向你显现的那位。  
35:2 雅各就对他家中的人、并一切与他同在的人说、你们要除掉你们中间的外邦神、也要自洁、更换衣裳。  
35:3 我们要起来、上伯特利去。在那里我要筑一座坛给　神、就是在我遭难的日子、应允我的祷告、在我行的路上保佑我的那位。  
35:4 他们就把外邦人的神像、和他们耳朵上的环子、交给雅各。雅各都藏在示剑那里的橡树底下。  
35:5 他们便起行前往。　神使那周围城邑的人都甚惊惧、就不追赶雅各的众子了。  

35:6 于是雅各和一切与他同在的人、到了迦南地的路斯、就是伯特利。  
35:7 他在那里筑了一座坛、就给那地方起名叫伊勒伯特利、〔就是伯特利之　神的意思〕因为他逃避他哥哥的时候、　神在那里向他显现。  
35:8 利百加的奶母底波拉死了、就葬在伯特利下边橡树底下。那棵树名叫亚伦巴古。  
35:9 雅各从巴旦亚兰回来、　神又向他显现赐福与他。  
35:10 且对他说、你的名原是雅各、从今以后不要再叫雅各、要叫以色列、这样、他就改名叫以色列。  

35:11 　神又对他说、我是全能的　神、你要生养众多、将来有一族、和多国的民从你而生、又有君王从你而出。  
35:12 我所赐给亚伯拉罕和以撒的地、我要赐给你、与你的后裔。  
35:13 　神就从那与雅各说话的地方升上去了。  
35:14 雅各便在那里立了一根石柱、在柱子上奠酒、浇油。  
35:15 雅各就给那地方起名叫伯特利。  

35:16 他们从伯特利起行、离以法他还有一段路程、拉结临产甚是艰难。  
35:17 正在艰难的时候、收生婆对他说、不要怕、你又要得一个儿子了。  
35:18 他将近于死、灵魂要走的时候、就给他儿子起名叫便俄尼、他父亲却给他起名叫便雅悯。  
35:19 拉结死了、葬在以法他的路旁。以法他就是伯利恒。  
35:20 雅各在他的坟上立了一统碑、就是拉结的墓碑、到今日还在。  

35:21 以色列起行前往、在以得台那边支搭帐棚。  
35:22 以色列住在那地的时候、流便去与他父亲的妾辟拉同寝、以色列也听见了。雅各共有十二个儿子。  
35:23 利亚所生的、是雅各的长子流便、还有西缅、利未、犹大、以萨迦、西布伦。  
35:24 拉结所生的是约瑟、便雅悯。  
35:25 拉结的使女辟拉所生的是但、拿弗他利。  

35:26 利亚的使女悉帕所生的是迦得、亚设、这是雅各在巴旦亚兰所生的儿子。  
35:27 雅各来到他父亲以撒那里、到了基列亚巴的幔利、乃是亚伯拉罕和以撒寄居的地方。基列亚巴就是希伯仑。  
35:28 以撒共活了一百八十岁。  
35:29 以撒年纪老迈、日子满足、气绝而死、归到他列祖〔原文作本民〕那里。他两个儿子以扫雅各把他埋葬了。

37:1 雅各住在迦南地、就是他父亲寄居的地。  
37:2 雅各的记略如下。约瑟十七岁与他哥哥们一同牧羊、他是个童子、与他父亲的妾、辟拉悉帕的儿子们常在一处。约瑟将他哥哥们的恶行、报给他们的父亲。  
37:3 以色列原来爱约瑟过于爱他的众子、因为约瑟是他年老生的、他给约瑟作了一件彩衣。  
37:4 约瑟的哥哥们见父亲爱约瑟过于爱他们、就恨约瑟、不与他说和睦的话。  
37:5 约瑟作了一梦、告诉他哥哥们、他们就越发恨他。  

37:6 约瑟对他们说、请听我所作的梦。  
37:7 我们在田里捆禾稼、我的捆起来站着、你们的捆来围着我的捆下拜。  
37:8 他的哥哥们回答说、难道你真要作我们的王么、难道你真要管辖我们么。他们就因为他的梦、和他的话、越发恨他。  
37:9 后来他又作了一梦、也告诉他的哥哥们说、看哪、我又作了一梦、梦见太阳、月亮、与十一个星、向我下拜。  
37:10 约瑟将这梦告诉他父亲、和他哥哥们、他父亲就责备他说、你作的这是甚么梦、难道我和你母亲、你弟兄、果然要来俯伏在地、向你下拜么。  

37:11 他哥哥们都嫉妒他。他父亲却把这话存在心里。  
37:12 约瑟的哥哥们往示剑去、放他们父亲的羊。  
37:13 以色列对约瑟说、你哥哥们不是在示剑放羊么、你来、我要打发你往他们那里去。约瑟说、我在这里。  
37:14 以色列说、你去看看你哥哥们平安不平安、群羊平安不平安、就回来报信给我。于是打发他出希伯仑谷、他就往示剑去了。  
37:15 有人遇见他在田野走迷了路、就问他说、你找甚么。  

37:16 他说、我找我的哥哥们、求你告诉我、他们在何处放羊。  
37:17 那人说、他们已经走了、我听见他们说、要往多坍去。约瑟就去追赶他哥哥们、遇见他们在多坍。  
37:18 他们远远的看见他、趁他还没有走到跟前、大家就同谋要害死他。  
37:19 彼此说、你看、那作梦的来了。  
37:20 来吧、我们将他杀了、丢在一个坑里、就说有恶兽把他吃了、我们且看他的梦将来怎么样。  

37:21 流便听见了要救他脱离他们的手、说、我们不可害他的性命。  
37:22 又说、不可流他的血、可以把他丢在这野地的坑里、不可下手害他。流便的意思是要救他脱离他们的手、把他归还他的父亲。  
37:23 约瑟到了他哥哥们那里、他们就剥了他的外衣、就是他穿的那件彩衣。  
37:24 把他丢在坑里。那坑是空的、里头没有水。  
37:25 他们坐下吃饭、举目观看、见有一伙米甸的以实玛利人、从基列来、用骆驼驮着香料、乳香、没药、要带下埃及去。  

37:26 犹大对众弟兄说、我们杀我们的兄弟、藏了他的血、有甚么益处呢。  
37:27 我们不如将他卖给以实玛利人、不可下手害他、因为他是我们的兄弟、我们的骨肉。众弟兄就听从了他。  
37:28 有些米甸的商人、从那里经过、哥哥们就把约瑟从坑里拉上来、讲定二十舍客勒银子、把约瑟卖给以实玛利人。他们就把约瑟带到埃及去了。  
37:29 流便回到坑边、见约瑟不在坑里、就撕裂衣服。  
37:30 回到兄弟们那里、说、童子没有了、我往那里去才好呢。  

37:31 他们宰了一只公山羊、把约瑟的那件彩衣染了血。  
37:32 打发人送到他们的父亲那里说、我们捡了这个、请认一认、是你儿子的外衣不是。  
37:33 他认得、就说、这是我儿子的外衣、有恶兽把他吃了、约瑟被撕碎了、撕碎了。  
37:34 雅各便撕裂衣服、腰间围上麻布、为他儿子悲哀了多日。  
37:35 他的儿女都起来安慰他。他却不肯受安慰、说、我必悲哀着下阴间到我儿子那里。约瑟的父亲就为他哀哭。  

37:36 米甸人带约瑟到埃及、把他卖给法老的内臣、护卫长波提乏。

38:1 那时犹大离开他弟兄下去、到一个亚杜兰人名叫希拉的家里去。  
38:2 犹大在那里看见一个迦南人名叫书亚的女儿、就娶他为妻、与他同房、  
38:3 他就怀孕生了儿子、犹大给他起名叫珥。  
38:4 他又怀孕生了儿子、母亲给他起名叫俄南。  
38:5 他复又生了儿子、给他起名叫示拉。他生示拉的时候、犹大正在基悉。  

38:6 犹大为长子珥娶妻、名叫他玛。  
38:7 犹大的长子珥在耶和华眼中看为恶、耶和华就叫他死了。  
38:8 犹大对俄南说、你当与你哥哥的妻子同房、向他尽你为弟的本分、为你哥哥生子立后。  
38:9 俄南知道生子不归自己、所以同房的时候、便遗在地、免得给他哥哥留后。  
38:10 俄南所作的、在耶和华眼中看为恶、耶和华也就叫他死了。  

38:11 犹大心里说、恐怕示拉也死、像他两个哥哥一样、就对他儿妇他玛说、你去、在你父亲家里守寡、等我儿子示拉长大。他玛就回去住在他父亲家里。  
38:12 过了许久、犹大的妻子书亚的女儿死了、犹大得了安慰、就和他朋友亚杜兰人希拉上亭拿去、到他剪羊毛的人那里。  
38:13 有人告诉他玛说、你的公公上亭拿剪羊毛去了。  
38:14 他玛见示拉已经长大、还没有娶他为妻、就脱了他作寡妇的衣裳、用帕子蒙着脸、又遮住身体、坐在亭拿路上的伊拿印城门口。  
38:15 犹大看见他、以为是妓女、因为他蒙着脸。  

38:16 犹大就转到他那里去说、来吧、让我与你同寝。他原不知道是他的儿妇。他玛说、你要与我同寝、把甚么给我呢。  
38:17 犹大说、我从羊群里取一只山羊羔打发人送来给你。他玛说、在未送以先、你愿意给我一个当头么。  
38:18 他说、我给你甚么当头呢、他玛说、你的印、你的带子、和你手里的杖。犹大就给了他、与他同寝。他就从犹大怀了孕。  
38:19 他玛起来走了、除去帕子、仍旧穿上作寡妇的衣裳。  
38:20 犹大托他朋友亚杜兰人、送一只山羊羔去、要从那女人手里取回当头来、却找不着他、  

38:21 就问那地方的人说、伊拿印路旁的妓女在那里、他们说、这里并没有妓女。  
38:22 他回去见犹大说、我没有找着他、并且那地方的人说、这里没有妓女。  
38:23 犹大说、我把这山羊羔送去了、你竟找不着他、任凭他拿去吧、免得我们被羞辱。  
38:24 约过了三个月、有人告诉犹大说、你的儿妇他玛作了妓女、且因行淫有了身孕。犹大说、拉出他来把他烧了。  
38:25 他玛被拉出来的时候、便打发人去见他公公、对他说、这些东西是谁的、我就是从谁怀的孕、请你认一认、这印、和带子、并杖、都是谁的。  

38:26 犹大承认说、他比我更有义、因为我没有将他给我的儿子示拉。从此犹大不再与他同寝了。  
38:27 他玛将要生产、不料他腹里是一对双生。  
38:28 到生产的时候、一个孩子伸出一只手来、收生婆拿红线拴在他手上、说、这是头生的。  
38:29 随后这孩子把手收回去、他哥哥生出来了、收生婆说、你为甚么抢着来呢、因此给他起名叫法勒斯。  
38:30 后来他兄弟那手上有红线的、也生出来、就给他起名叫谢拉。

39:1 约瑟被带下埃及去。有一个埃及人是法老的内臣、护卫长波提乏、从那些带下他来的以实玛利人手下买了他去。  
39:2 约瑟住在他主人埃及人的家中。耶和华与他同在、他就百事顺利。  
39:3 他主人见耶和华与他同在、又见耶和华使他手里所办的尽都顺利。  
39:4 约瑟就在主人眼前蒙恩、伺候他主人、并且主人派他管理家务、把一切所有的都交在他手里。  
39:5 自从主人派约瑟管理家务、和他一切所有的、耶和华就因约瑟的缘故、赐福与那埃及人的家。凡家里和田间一切所有的、都蒙耶和华赐福。  

39:6 波提乏将一切所有的、都交在约瑟的手中、除了自己所吃的饭、别的事一概不知。约瑟原来秀雅俊美。  
39:7 这事以后、约瑟主人的妻以目送情给约瑟、说、你与我同寝吧。  
39:8 约瑟不从、对他主人的妻说、看哪、一切家务、我主人都不知道、他把所有的都交在我手里。  
39:9 在这家里没有比我大的、并且他没有留下一样不交给我、只留下了你、因为你是他的妻子、我怎能作这大恶、得罪　神呢。  
39:10 后来他天天和约瑟说、约瑟却不听从他、不与他同寝、也不和他在一处。  

39:11 有一天、约瑟进屋里去办事、家中人没有一个在那屋里。  
39:12 妇人就拉住他的衣裳说、你与我同寝吧。约瑟把衣裳丢在妇人手里、跑到外边去了。  
39:13 妇人看见约瑟把衣裳丢在他手里跑出去了、  
39:14 就叫了家里的人来、对他们说、你们看、他带了一个希伯来人、进入我们家里、要戏弄我们。他到我这里来、要与我同寝、我就大声喊叫。  
39:15 他听见我放声喊起来、就把衣裳丢在我这里、跑到外边去了。  

39:16 妇人把约瑟的衣裳放在自己那里、等着他主人回家、  
39:17 就对他如此如此说、你所带到我们这里的那希伯来仆人、进来要戏弄我。  
39:18 我放声喊起来、他就把衣裳丢在我这里跑出去了。  
39:19 约瑟的主人听见他妻子对他所说的话、说、你的仆人如此如此待我、他就生气。  
39:20 把约瑟下在监里、就是王的囚犯被囚的地方。于是约瑟在那里坐监。  

39:21 但耶和华与约瑟同在、向他施恩、使他在司狱的眼前蒙恩。  
39:22 司狱就把监里所有的囚犯、都交在约瑟手下、他们在那里所办的事、都是经他的手。  
39:23 凡在约瑟手下的事、司狱一概不察、因为耶和华与约瑟同在、耶和华使他所作的尽都顺利。

40:1 这事以后、埃及王的酒政和膳长、得罪了他们的主埃及王、  
40:2 法老就恼怒酒政和膳长这二臣。  
40:3 把他们下在护卫长府内的监里、就是约瑟被囚的地方。  
40:4 护卫长把他们交给约瑟、约瑟便伺候他们。他们有些日子在监里。  
40:5 被囚在监之埃及王的酒政和膳长、二人同夜各作一梦、各梦都有讲解。  

40:6 到了早晨、约瑟进到他们那里、见他们有愁闷的样子。  
40:7 他便问法老的二臣、就是与他同囚在他主人府里的、说、他们今日为甚么面带愁容呢。  
40:8 他们对他说、我们各人作了一梦、没有人能解。约瑟说、解梦不是出于　神么、请你们将梦告诉我。  
40:9 酒政便将他的梦告诉约瑟说、我梦见在我面前有一棵葡萄树、  
40:10 树上有三根枝子、好像发了芽、开了花、上头的葡萄都成熟了。  

40:11 法老的杯在我手中、我就拿葡萄挤在法老的杯里、将杯递在他手中。  
40:12 约瑟对他说、他所作的梦是这样解、三根枝子就是三天。  
40:13 三天之内、法老必提你出监、叫你官复原职、你仍要递杯在法老的手中、和先前作他的酒政一样。  
40:14 但你得好处的时候、求你记念我、施恩与我、在法老面前提说我、救我出这监牢。  
40:15 我实在是从希伯来人之地被拐来的、我在这里也没有作过甚么、叫他们把我下在监里。  

40:16 膳长见梦解得好、就对约瑟说、我在梦中见我头上顶着三筐白饼。  
40:17 极上的筐子里、有为法老烤的各样食物、有飞鸟来吃我头上筐子里的食物。  
40:18 约瑟说、你的梦是这样解、三个筐子就是三天。  
40:19 三天之内、法老必斩断你的头、把你挂在木头上、必有飞鸟来吃你身上的肉。  
40:20 到了第三天、是法老的生日、他为众臣仆设摆筵席、把酒政和膳长提出监来。  

40:21 使酒政官复原职、他仍旧递杯在法老手中。  
40:22 但把膳长挂起来、正如约瑟向他们所解的话。  
40:23 酒政却不记念约瑟、竟忘了他。

41:1 过了两年法老作梦。梦见自己站在河边。  
41:2 有七只母牛从河里上来、又美好、又肥壮在芦荻中吃草。  
41:3 随后又有七只母牛从河里上来、又丑陋、又干瘦、与那七只母牛一同站在河边。  
41:4 这又丑陋、又干瘦的七只母牛、吃尽了那又美好、又肥壮的七只母牛。法老就醒了。  
41:5 他又睡着、第二回作梦。梦见一棵麦子长了七个穗子、又肥大、又佳美。  

41:6 随后又长了七个穗子、又细弱、又被东风吹焦了。  
41:7 这细弱的穗子、吞了那七个又肥大又饱满的穗子。法老醒了、不料是个梦。  
41:8 到了早晨、法老心里不安、就差人召了埃及所有的术士和博士来。法老就把所作的梦告诉他们、却没有人能给法老圆解。  
41:9 那时酒政对法老说、我今日想起我的罪来。  
41:10 从前法老恼怒臣仆、把我和膳长下在护卫长府布的监里。  

41:11 我们二人同夜各作一梦、各梦都有讲解。  
41:12 在那里同着我们有一个希伯来的少年人、是护卫长的仆人、我们告诉他、他就把我们的梦圆解、是按着各人的梦圆解的。  
41:13 后来正如他给我们圆解的成就了。我官复原职、膳长被挂起来了。  
41:14 法老遂即差人去召约瑟。他们便急忙带他出监、他就剃头、刮脸、换衣裳、进到法老面前。  
41:15 法老对约瑟说、我作了一梦没有人能解、我听见人说、你听了梦就能解。  

41:16 约瑟回答法老说、这不在乎我、　神必将平安的话回答法老。  
41:17 法老对约瑟说、我梦见我站在河边。  
41:18 有七只母牛从河里上来、又肥壮、又美好、在芦荻中吃草。  
41:19 随后又有七只母牛上来、又软弱、又丑陋、又干瘦、在埃及遍地、我没有见过这样不好的。  
41:20 这又干瘦、又丑陋的母牛、吃尽了那以先的七只肥母牛。  

41:21 吃了以后、却看不出是吃了、那丑陋的样子仍旧和先前一样。我就醒了。  
41:22 我又梦见一棵麦子、长了七个穗子、又饱满、又佳美。  
41:23 随后又长了七个穗子、枯槁细弱、被东风吹焦了。  
41:24 这些细弱的穗子、吞了那七个佳美的穗子。我将这梦告诉了术士、却没有人能给我解说。  
41:25 约瑟对法老说、法老的梦乃是一个、　神已将所要作的事指示法老了。  

41:26 七只好母牛是七年。七个好穗子也是七年。这梦乃是一个。  
41:27 那随后上来的七只又干瘦、又丑陋的母牛是七年、那七个虚空被东风吹焦的穗子也是七年。都是七个荒年。  
41:28 这就是我对法老所说、　神已将所要作的事显明给法老了。  
41:29 埃及遍地必来七个大丰年。  
41:30 随后又要来七个荒年、甚至埃及地都忘了先前的丰收、全地必被饥荒所灭。  

41:31 因那以后的饥荒甚大、便不觉得先前的丰收了。  
41:32 至于法老两回作梦、是因　神命定这事、而且必速速成就。  
41:33 所以法老当拣选一个有聪明有智慧的人、派他治理埃及地。  
41:34 法老当这样行、又派官员管理这地。当七个丰年的时候、征收埃及地的五分之一。  
41:35 叫他们把将来丰年一切的粮食聚敛起来、积蓄五谷、收存在各城里作食物、归于法老的手下。  

41:36 所积蓄的粮食、可以防备埃及地将来的七个荒年、免得这地被饥荒所灭。  
41:37 法老和他一切臣仆、都以这事为妙。  
41:38 法老对臣仆说、像这样的人、有　神的灵在他里头、我们岂能找得着呢。  
41:39 法老对约瑟说、　神既将这事都指示你、可见没有人像你这样有聪明有智慧。  
41:40 你可以掌管我的家、我的民都必听从你的话、惟独在宝座上我比你大。  

41:41 法老又对约瑟说、我派你治理埃及全地。  
41:42 法老就摘下手上打印的戒指、戴在约瑟的手上。给他穿上细麻衣、把金链戴在他的颈项上。  
41:43 又叫约瑟坐他的副车、喝道的在前呼叫说、跪下。这样、法老派他治理埃及全地。  
41:44 法老对约瑟说、我是法老、在埃及全地、若没有你的命令、不许人擅自办事。〔原文作动手动脚〕  
41:45 法老赐名给约瑟、叫撒发那忒巴内亚。又将安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳、给他为妻。约瑟就出去巡行埃及地。  

41:46 约瑟见埃及王法老的时候、年三十岁。他从法老面前出去遍行埃及全地。  
41:47 七个丰年之内、地的出产极丰极盛。〔原文作一把一把的〕  
41:48 约瑟聚敛埃及地七个丰年一切的粮食、把粮食积存在各城里、各城周围田地的粮食、都积存在本城里。  
41:49 约瑟积蓄五谷甚多、如同海边的沙、无法计算、因为谷不可胜数。  
41:50 荒年未到以前、安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳给约瑟生了两个儿子。  

41:51 约瑟给长子起名叫玛拿西、〔就是使之忘了的意思〕因为他说、　神使我忘了一切的困苦、和我父的全家。  
41:52 他给次子起名叫以法莲、〔就是使之昌盛的意思〕因为他说、　神使我在受苦的地方昌盛。  
41:53 埃及地的七个丰年一完、  
41:54 七个荒年就来了、正如约瑟所说的。各地都有饥荒、惟独埃及全地有粮食。  
41:55 及至埃及全地有了饥荒、众民向法老哀求粮食、法老对他们说、你们往约瑟那里去、凡他所说的你们都要作。  

41:56 当时饥荒遍满天下、约瑟开了各处的仓、粜粮给埃及人。在埃及地饥荒甚大。  
41:57 各地的人都往埃及去、到约瑟那里籴粮、因为天下的饥荒甚大。

42:1 雅各见埃及有粮、就对儿子们说、你们为甚么彼此观望呢。  
42:2 我听见埃及有粮、你们可以下去从那里为我们籴些来、使我们可以存活、不至于死。  
42:3 于是约瑟的十个哥哥都下埃及籴粮去了。  
42:4 但约瑟的兄弟便雅悯、雅各没有打发他和哥哥们同去、因为雅各说、恐怕他遭害。  
42:5 来籴粮的人中有以色列的儿子们、因为迦南地也有饥荒。  

42:6 当时治理埃及地的是约瑟、粜粮给那地众民的就是他。约瑟的哥哥们来了、脸伏于地、向他下拜。  
42:7 约瑟看见他哥哥们、就认得他们、却装作生人、向他们说些严厉话、问他们说、你们从那里来。他们说、我们从迦南地来籴粮。  
42:8 约瑟认得他哥哥们、他们却不认得他。  
42:9 约瑟想起从前所作的那两个梦、就对他们说、你们是奸细、来窥探这地的虚实。  
42:10 他们对他说、我主阿、不是的、仆人们是籴粮来的、  

42:11 我们都是一个人的儿子、是诚实人、仆人们并不是奸细。  
42:12 约瑟说、不然、你们必是窥探这地的虚实来的。  
42:13 他们说、仆人们本是弟兄十二人、是迦南地一个人的儿子、顶小的现今在我们的父亲那里、有一个没有了。  
42:14 约瑟说、我才说你们是奸细、这话实在不错、  
42:15 我指着法老的性命起誓、若是你们的小兄弟、不到这里来、你们就不得出这地方、从此就可以把你们证验出来了。  

42:16 须要打发你们中间一个人去、把你们的兄弟带来、至于你们、都要囚在这里、好证验你们的话真不真、若不真、我指着法老的性命起誓、你们一定是奸细。  
42:17 于是约瑟把他们都下在监里三天。  
42:18 到了第三天、约瑟对他们说、我是敬畏　神的、你们照我的话行、就可以存活。  
42:19 你们如果是诚实人、可以留你们中间的一个人囚在监里、但你们可以带着粮食回去、救你们家里的饥荒。  
42:20 把你们的小兄弟带到我这里来、如此、你们的话便有证据、你们也不至于死。他们就照样而行。  

42:21 他们彼此说、我们在兄弟身上实在有罪、他哀求我们的时候、我们见他心里的愁苦、却不肯听、所以这场苦难临到我们身上。  
42:22 流便说、我岂不是对你们说过、不可伤害那孩子么、只是你们不肯听、所以流他血的罪向我们追讨。  
42:23 他们不知道约瑟听得出来、因为在他们中间用通事传话。  
42:24 约瑟转身退去、哭了一场、又回来对他们说话、就从他们中间挑出西缅来、在他们眼前把他捆绑。  
42:25 约瑟吩咐人把粮食装满他们的器具、把各人的银子归还在各人的口袋里、又给他们路上用的食物、人就照他的话办了。  

42:26 他们就把粮食驮在驴上、离开那里去了。  
42:27 到了住宿的地方、他们中间有一个人打开口袋、要拿料喂驴、才看见自己的银子仍在口袋里。  
42:28 就对弟兄们说、我的银子归还了、看哪、仍在我口袋里。他们就提心吊胆、战战兢兢的彼此说、这是　神向我们作甚么呢。  
42:29 他们来到迦南地他们的父亲雅各那里、将所遭遇的事都告诉他、说、  
42:30 那地的主对我们说严厉的话、把我们当作窥探那地的奸细。  

42:31 我们对他说、我们是诚实人、并不是奸细。  
42:32 我们本是弟兄十二人、都是一个父亲的儿子、有一个没有了、顶小的如今同我们的父亲在迦南地。  
42:33 那地的主对我们说、若要我知道你们是诚实人、可以留下你们中间的一个人在我这里、你们可以带着粮食回去、救你们家里的饥荒。  
42:34 把你们的小兄弟带到我这里来、我便知道你们不是奸细、乃是诚实人。这样、我就把你们的弟兄交给你们、你们也可以在这地作买卖。  
42:35 后来他们倒口袋、不料各人的银包都在口袋里、他们和父亲看见银包就都害怕。  

42:36 他们的父亲雅各对他们说、你们使我丧失我的儿子。约瑟没有了、西缅也没有了、你们又要将便雅悯带去。这些事都归到我身上了。  
42:37 流便对他父亲说、我若不带他回来交给你、你可以杀我的两个儿子、只管把他交在我手里、我必带他回来交给你。  
42:38 雅各说、我的儿子不可与你们一同下去。他哥哥死了、只剩下他、他若在你们所行的路上遭害、那便是你们使我白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨的下阴间去了。

43:1 那地的饥荒甚大。  
43:2 他们从埃及带来的粮食吃尽了、他们的父亲就对他们说、你们再去给我籴些粮来。  
43:3 犹大对他说、那人谆谆的诰诫我们、说、你们的兄弟若不与你们同来、你们就不得见我的面。  
43:4 你若打发我们的兄弟与我们同去、我们就下去给你籴粮。  
43:5 你若不打发他去、我们就不下去、因为那人对我们说、你们的兄弟若不与你们同来、你们就不得见我的面。  

43:6 以色列说、你们为甚么这样害我、告诉那人你们还有兄弟呢。  
43:7 他们回答说、那人详细问到我们、和我们的亲属、说、你们的父亲还在么。你们还有兄弟么。我们就按着他所问的告诉他、焉能知道他要说、必须把你们的兄弟带下来呢。  
43:8 犹大又对他父亲以色列说、你打发童子与我同去、我们就起身下去、好叫我们和你、并我们的妇人孩子都得存活、不至于死。  
43:9 我为他作保、你可以从我手中追讨、我若不带他回来交在你面前、我情愿永远担罪。  
43:10 我们若没有耽搁、如今第二次都回来了。  

43:11 他们的父亲以色列说、若必须如此、你们就当这样行、可以将这地、土产中最好的乳香、蜂蜜、香料、没药、榧子、杏仁、都取一点收在器具里、带下去送给那人作礼物。  
43:12 又要手里加倍的带银子、并将归还在你们口袋内的银子、仍带在手里。那或者是错了。  
43:13 也带着你们的兄弟、起身去见那人。  
43:14 但愿全能的　神使你们在那人面前蒙怜悯、释放你们的那弟兄和便雅悯回来。我若丧了儿子、就丧了吧。  
43:15 于是他们拿着那礼物、又手里加倍的带银子、并且带着便雅悯、起身下到埃及站在约瑟面前。  

43:16 约瑟见便雅悯和他们同来、就对家宰说、将这些人领到屋里、要宰杀牲畜、预备筵席、因为晌午这些人同我吃饭。  
43:17 家宰就遵着约瑟的命去行、领他们进约瑟的屋里。  
43:18 他们因为被领到约瑟的屋里、就害怕、说、领我们到这里来、必是因为头次归还在我们口袋里的银子、找我们的错缝、下手害我们、强取我们为奴仆、抢夺我们的驴。  
43:19 他们就挨进约瑟的家宰、在屋门口和他说话、  
43:20 说、我主阿、我们头次下来实在是要籴粮。  

43:21 后来到了住宿的地方、我们打开口袋、不料各人的银子分量足数、仍在各人的口袋内、现在我们手里又带回来了。  
43:22 另外又带下银子来籴粮、不知道先前谁把银子放在我们的口袋里。  
43:23 家宰说、你们可以放心、不要害怕、是你们的　神、和你们父亲的　神、赐给你们财宝在你们的口袋里。你们的银子我早已收了。他就把西缅带出来交给他们。  
43:24 家宰就领他们进约瑟的屋里、给他们水洗脚、又给他们草料喂驴。  
43:25 他们就预备那礼物、等候约瑟晌午来、因为他们听见要在那里吃饭。  

43:26 约瑟来到家里、他们就把手中的礼物拿进屋去给他、又俯伏在地向他下拜。  
43:27 约瑟问他们好、又问、你们的父亲、就是你们所说的那老人家平安么。他还在么。  
43:28 他们回答说、你仆人我们的父亲平安、他还在。于是他们低头下拜。  
43:29 约瑟举目看见他同母的兄弟便雅悯、就说、你们向我所说那顶小的兄弟、就是这位么。又说、小儿阿、愿　神赐恩给你。  
43:30 约瑟爱弟之情发动、就急忙寻找可哭之地、进入自己的屋里、哭了一场。  

43:31 他洗了脸出来、勉强隐忍、吩咐人摆饭。  
43:32 他们就为约瑟单摆了一席、为那些人又摆了一席、也为和约瑟同吃饭的埃及人另摆了一席。因为埃及人不可和希伯来人一同吃饭。那原是埃及人所厌恶的。  
43:33 约瑟使众弟兄在他面前排列坐席、都按着长幼的次序。众弟兄就彼此诧异。  
43:34 约瑟把他面前的食物分出来、送给他们。但便雅悯所得的、比别人多五倍。他们就饮酒、和约瑟一同宴乐。

创世纪 44章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34

44:1 约瑟吩咐家宰说、把粮食装满这些人的口袋、尽着他们的驴所能驮的、又把各人的银子放在各人的口袋里。  
44:2 并将我的银杯、和那少年人籴粮的银子、一同装在他的口袋里。家宰就照约瑟所说的话行了。  
44:3 天一亮就打发那些人带着驴走了。  
44:4 他们出城走了不远、约瑟对家宰说、起来追那些人去、追上了就对他们说、你们为甚么以恶报善呢。  
44:5 这不是我主人饮酒的杯么、岂不是他占卜用的么、你们这样行是作恶了。  

44:6 家宰追上他们、将这些话对他们说了。  
44:7 他们回答说、我主为甚么说这样的话呢、你仆人断不能作这样的事。  
44:8 你看、我们从前在口袋里所见的银子、尚且从迦南地带来还你、我们怎能从你主人家里偷窃金银呢。  
44:9 你仆人中、无论在谁那里搜出来、就叫他死、我们也作我主的奴仆。  
44:10 家宰说、现在就照你们的话行吧、在谁那里搜出来、谁就作我的奴仆。其余的都没有罪。  

44:11 于是他们各人急忙把口袋卸在地下、各人打开口袋。  
44:12 家宰就搜查、从年长的起、到年幼的为止、那杯竟在便雅悯的口袋里搜出来。  
44:13 他们就撕裂衣服、各人把驮子抬在驴上、回城去了。  
44:14 犹大和他弟兄们来到约瑟的屋中、约瑟还在那里、他们就在他面前俯伏于地。  
44:15 约瑟对他们说、你们作的是甚么事呢、你们岂不知像我这样的人必能占卜吗。  

44:16 犹大说、我们对我主说甚么呢。还有甚么话可说呢。我们怎能自己表白出来呢。　神已经查出仆人的罪孽了。我们与那在他手中搜出杯来的都是我主的奴仆。  
44:17 约瑟说、我断不能这样行、在谁的手中搜出杯来、谁就作我的奴仆。至于你们可以平平安安的上你们父亲那里去。  
44:18 犹大挨近他说、我主阿、求你容仆人说一句话给我主听、不要向仆人发烈怒、因为你如同法老一样。  
44:19 我主曾问仆人们说、你们有父亲有兄弟没有。  
44:20 我们对我主说、我们有父亲、已经年老、还有他老年所生的一个小孩子、他哥哥死了、他母亲只撇下他一人、他父亲疼爱他。  

44:21 你对仆人说、把他带到我这里来、叫我亲眼看看他。  
44:22 我们对我主说、童子不能离开他父亲、若是离开、他父亲必死。  
44:23 你对仆人说、你们的小兄弟若不与你们一同下来、你们就不得再见我的面。  
44:24 我们上到你仆人我们父亲那里、就把我主的话告诉了他。  
44:25 我们的父亲说、你们再去给我籴些粮来。  

44:26 我们就说、我们不能下去、我们的小兄弟若和我们同往、我们就可以下去、因为小兄弟若不与我们同往、我们必不得见那人的面。  
44:27 你仆人我父亲对我们说、你们知道我的妻子给我生了两个儿子。  
44:28 一个离开我出去了、我说、他必是被撕碎了、直到如今我也没有见他。  
44:29 现在你们又要把这个带去离开我、倘若他遭害、那便是你们使我白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨的下阴间去了。』
44:30 我父亲的命与这童子的命相连、如今我回到你仆人我父亲那里、若没有童子与我们同在、  

44:31 我们的父亲见没有童子、他就必死。这便是我们使你仆人我们的父亲白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨的下阴间去了。  
44:32 因为仆人曾向我父亲为这童子作保、说、我若不带他回来交给父亲、我便在父亲面前永远担罪。  
44:33 现在求你容仆人住下、替这童子作我主的奴仆、叫童子和他哥哥们一同上去。  
44:34 若童子不和我同去、我怎能上去见我父亲呢、恐怕我看见灾祸临到我父亲身上。

创世纪 45章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28

45:1 约瑟在左右站着的人面前、情不自禁、吩咐一声说、人都要离开我出去。约瑟和弟兄相认的时候、并没有一人站在他面前。  
45:2 他就放声大哭、埃及人、和法老家中的人都听见了。  
45:3 约瑟对他弟兄们说、我是约瑟、我的父亲还在么。他弟兄不能回答、因为在他面前都惊惶。  
45:4 约瑟又对他弟兄们说、请你们近前来、他们就近前来。他说、我是你们的兄弟约瑟、就是你们所卖到埃及的。  
45:5 现在不要因为把我卖到这里、自忧自恨、这是　神差我在你们以先来、为要保全生命。  

45:6 现在这地的饥荒已经二年了、还在五年不能耕种、不能收成。  
45:7 　神差我在你们以先来、为要给你们存留余种在世上、又要大施拯救、保全你们的生命。  
45:8 这样看来、差我到这里来的不是你们、乃是　神、他又使我如法老的父、作他全家的主、并埃及全地的宰相。  
45:9 你们要赶紧上到我父亲那里、对他说、你儿子约瑟这样说、　神使我作全埃及的主、请你下到我这里来、不要耽延。  
45:10 你和你我儿子、孙子、连牛群、羊群、并一切所有的、都可以住在歌珊地、与我相近。  

45:11 我要在那里奉养你。因为还有五年的饥荒、免得你和你的眷属、并一切所有的、都败落了。  
45:12 况且你们的眼和我兄弟便雅悯的眼、都看见是我亲口对你们说话。  
45:13 你们也要将我在埃及一切的荣耀、和你们所看见的事、都告诉我父亲、又要赶紧的将我父亲搬到我这里来。  
45:14 于是约瑟伏在他兄弟便雅悯的颈项上哭、便雅悯也在他的颈项上哭。  
45:15 他又与众弟兄亲嘴、抱着他们哭、随后他弟兄就和他说话。  

45:16 这风声传到法老的宫里、说、约瑟的弟兄们来了。法老和他的臣仆都很喜欢。  
45:17 法老对约瑟说、你吩咐你的弟兄们说、你们要这样行、把驮子抬在牲口上、起身往迦南地去。  
45:18 将你们的父亲和你们的眷属、都搬到我这里来、我要把埃及地的美物赐给你们、你们也要吃这地肥美的出产。  
45:19 现在我吩咐你们要这样行、从埃及地带着车辆去、把你们的孩子、和妻子、并你们的父亲都搬来。  
45:20 你们眼中不要爱惜你们的家具、因为埃及全地的美物、都是你们的。  

45:21 以色列的儿子们就如此行、约瑟照着法老的吩咐给他们车辆、和路上用的食物。  
45:22 又给他们各人一套衣服、惟独给便雅悯三百银子、五套衣服。  
45:23 送给他父亲公驴十匹、驮着埃及的美物、母驴十匹、驮着粮食与饼、和菜、为他父亲路上用。  
45:24 于是约瑟打发他弟兄们回去、又对他们说、你们不要在路上相争。  
45:25 他们从埃及上去、来到迦南地、他们的父亲雅各那里。  

45:26 告诉他说、约瑟还在、并且作埃及全地的宰相。雅各心里冰凉、因为不信他们。  
45:27 他们便将约瑟对他们说的一切话、都告诉了他。他们父亲雅各、又看见约瑟打发来接他的车辆、心就苏醒了。  
45:28 以色列说、罢了、罢了、我的儿子约瑟还在、趁我未死以先、我要去见他一面。

创世纪 46章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34

46:1 以色列带着一切所有的、起身来到别是巴、就献祭给他父亲以撒的　神。  
46:2 夜间　神在异象中对以色列说、雅各、雅各。他说、我在这里。  
46:3 　神说、我是　神、就是你父亲的　神、你下埃及去不要害怕、因为我必使你在那里成为大族。  
46:4 我要和你同下埃及去、也必定带你上来。约瑟必给你送终。〔原文作将手按在你的眼睛上〕  
46:5 雅各就从别是巴起行。以色列的儿子们使他们的父亲雅各、和他们的妻子、儿女、都坐在法老为雅各送来的车上。  

46:6 他们又带着迦南地所得的牲畜、货财、来到埃及。雅各和他的一切子孙都一同来了。  
46:7 雅各把他的儿子、孙子、女儿、孙女、并他的子子孙孙、一同带到埃及。  
46:8 来到埃及的以色列人、名字记在下面。雅各和他的儿孙、雅各的长子是流便。  
46:9 流便的儿子是哈诺、法路、希斯伦、迦米。  
46:10 西缅的儿子是耶母利、雅悯、阿辖、雅斤、琐辖。还有迦南女子所生的扫罗。  

46:11 利未的儿子是革顺、哥辖、米拉利。  
46:12 犹大的儿子是珥、俄南、示拉、法勒斯、谢拉。惟有珥与俄南死在迦南地。法勒斯的儿子是希斯伦、哈母勒。  
46:13 以萨迦的儿子是陀拉、普瓦、约伯、伸仑。  
46:14 西布伦的儿子是西烈、以伦、雅利。  
46:15 这是利亚在巴旦亚兰给雅各所生的儿子、还有女儿底拿。儿孙共三十三人。  

46:16 迦得的儿子是洗非芸、哈基、书尼、以斯本、以利、亚罗底、亚列利。  
46:17 亚设的儿子是音拿、亦施瓦、亦施韦、比利亚、还有他们的妹子西拉。比利亚的儿子是希别、玛结。  
46:18 这是拉班给他女儿利亚的婢女悉帕、从雅各所生的儿孙、共有十六人。  
46:19 雅各之妻拉结的儿子是约瑟、和便雅悯。  
46:20 约瑟在埃及地生了玛拿西和以法莲、就是安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳给约瑟生的。  

46:21 便雅悯的儿子是比拉、比结、亚实别、基拉、乃幔、以希、罗实、母平、户平、亚勒。  
46:22 这是拉结给雅各所生的儿孙、共有十四人。  
46:23 但的儿子是户伸。  
46:24 拿弗他利的儿子是雅薛、沽尼、耶色、示冷。  
46:25 这是拉班给他女儿拉结的婢女辟拉、从雅各所生的儿孙、共有七人。  

46:26 那与雅各同到埃及的、除了他儿妇之外、凡从他所生的、共有六十六人。  
46:27 还有约瑟在埃及所生的两个儿子。雅各家来到埃及的共有七十人。  
46:28 雅各打发犹大先去见约瑟、请派人引路往歌珊去。于是他们来到歌珊地。  
46:29 约瑟套车往歌珊去、迎接他父亲以色列。及至见了面、就伏在父亲的颈项上、哭了许久。  
46:30 以色列对约瑟说、我既得见你的面、知道你还在、就是死我也甘心。  

46:31 约瑟对他的弟兄、和他父的全家说、我要上去告诉法老、对他说、我的弟兄和我父的全家、从前在迦南地、现今都到我这里来了。  
46:32 他们本是牧羊的人、以养牲畜为业、他们把羊群、牛群、和一切所有的都带来了。  
46:33 等法老召你们的时候、问你们说、你们以何事为业、  
46:34 你们要说、你的仆人从幼年直到如今、都以养牲畜为业、连我们的祖宗也都以此为业。这样、你们可以住在歌珊地、因为凡牧羊的都被埃及人所厌恶。

创世纪 47章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31

47:1 约瑟进去告诉法老说、我的父亲和我的弟兄带着羊群、牛群、并一切所有的、从迦南地来了、如今在歌珊地。  
47:2 约瑟从他弟兄中挑出五个人来、引他们去见法老。  
47:3 法老问约瑟的弟兄说、你们以可事为业。他们对法老说、你仆人是牧羊的、连我们的祖宗、也是牧羊的。  
47:4 他们又对法老说、迦南地的饥荒甚大、仆人的羊群没有草吃、所以我们来到这地寄居。现在求你容仆人住在歌珊地。  
47:5 法老对约瑟说、你父亲和你弟兄到你这里来了。  

47:6 埃及地都在你面前、只管叫你父亲和你弟兄住在国中最好的地、他们可以住在歌珊地。你若知道他们中间有甚么能人、就派他们看管我的牲畜。  
47:7 约瑟领他父亲雅各进到法老面前、雅各就给法老祝福。  
47:8 法老问雅各说、你平生的年日是多少呢。  
47:9 雅各对法老说、我寄居在世的年日是一百三十岁、我平生的年日又少、又苦、不及我列祖早在世寄居的年日。  
47:10 雅各又给法老祝福、就从法老面前出去了。  

47:11 约瑟遵着法老的命、把埃及国最好的地、就是兰塞境内的地、给他父亲和弟兄居住、作为产业。  
47:12 约瑟用粮食奉养他父亲、和他弟兄、并他父亲全家的眷属、都是照各家的人口奉养他们。  
47:13 饥荒甚大、全地都绝了粮、甚至埃及地和迦南地的人、因那饥荒的缘故、都饿昏了。  
47:14 约瑟收聚了埃及地和迦南地所有的银子、就是众人籴粮的银子、约瑟就把那银子带到法老的宫里。  
47:15 埃及地和迦南地的银子都花尽了、埃及众人都来见约瑟说、我们的银子都用尽了、求你给我们粮食、我们为甚么死在你面前呢。  

47:16 约瑟说、若是银子用尽了、可以把你们的牲畜给我、我就为你们的牲畜给你们粮食。  
47:17 于是他们把牲畜赶到约瑟那里、约瑟就拿粮食换了他们的牛、羊、驴、马、那一年因换他们一切的牲畜、就用粮食养活他们。  
47:18 那一年过去、第二年他们又来见约瑟说、我们不瞒我主、我们的银子都花尽了、牲畜也都归了我主、我们在我主眼前除了我们的身体和田地之外、一无所剩。  
47:19 你何忍见我们人死地荒呢。求你用粮食买我们的我们的地、我们和我们的地就要给法老效力。又求你给我们种子、使我们得以存活、不至死亡、地土也不至荒凉。  
47:20 于是约瑟为法老买了埃及所有的地、埃及人因被饥荒所迫、各都卖了自己的田地。那地就都归了法老。  

47:21 至于百姓、约瑟叫他们从埃及这边、直到埃及那边、都各归各城。  
47:22 惟有祭司的地、约瑟没有买、因为祭司有从法老所得的常俸、他们吃法老所给的常俸、所以他们不卖自己的地。  
47:23 约瑟对百姓说、我今日为法老买了你们、和你们的地、看哪、这里有种子给你们、你们可以种地。  
47:24 后来打粮食的时候、你们要把五分之一纳给法老、四分可以归你们作地里的种子、也作你们和你们家口孩童的食物。  
47:25 他们说、你救了我们的性命、但愿我们在我主眼前蒙恩、我们就作法老的仆人。  

47:26 于是约瑟为埃及地定下常例直到今日、法老必得五分之一、惟独祭司的地不归法老。  
47:27 以色列人住在埃及的歌珊地、他们在那里置了产业、并且生育甚多。  
47:28 雅各住在埃及地十七年、雅各平生的年日是一百四十七岁。  
47:29 以色列的死期临近了、他就叫了他儿子约瑟来、说、我若在你眼前蒙恩、请你把手放在我大腿底下、用慈爱和诚实待我、请你不要将我葬在埃及。  
47:30 我与我祖我父同睡的时候、你要将我带出埃及、葬在他们所葬的地方。约瑟说、我必遵着你的命而行。  

47:31 雅各说、你要向我起誓、约瑟就向他起了誓、于是以色列在床头上〔或作扶着杖头〕敬拜　神。

48:1 这事以后、有人告诉约瑟说、你的父亲病了。他就带着两个儿子玛拿西和以法莲同去。  
48:2 有人告诉雅各说、请看、你儿子约瑟到你这里来了。以色列就勉强在床上坐起来。  
48:3 雅各对约瑟说、全能的　神曾在迦南地的路斯向我显现、赐福与我。  
48:4 对我说、我必使你生养众多、成为多民、又要把这地赐给你的后裔、永远为业。  
48:5 我未到埃及见你之先、你在埃及地所生的以法莲和玛拿西、这两个儿子是我的。正如流便和西缅是我的一样。  

48:6 你在他们以后所生的、就是你的、他们可以归于他们弟兄的名下得产业。  
48:7 至于我、我从巴旦来的时候、拉结死在我眼前、在迦南地的路上、离以法他还有一段路程、我就把他葬在以法他的路上。以法他就是伯利恒。  
48:8 以色列看见约瑟的两个儿子、就说、这是谁。  
48:9 约瑟对他父亲说、这是　神在这里赐给我的儿子。以色列说、请你领他们到我跟前、我要给他们祝福。  
48:10 以色列年纪老迈、眼睛昏花、不能看见、约瑟领他们到他跟前、他就和他们亲嘴、抱着他们。  

48:11 以色列对约瑟说、我想不到得见你的面、不料、　神又使我得见你的儿子。  
48:12 约瑟把两个儿子从以色列两膝中领出来、自己就脸伏于地下拜。  
48:13 随后约瑟又拉着他们两个、以法莲在他的右手里、对着以色列的左手、玛拿西在他的左手里、对着以色列的右手、领他们到以色列的跟前。  
48:14 以色列伸出右手来、按在以法莲的头上。以法莲乃是次子、又剪搭过左手来、按在玛拿西的头上、玛拿西原是长子。  
48:15 他就给约瑟祝福、说、愿我祖亚伯拉罕、和我父以撒所事奉的　神、就是一生牧养我直到今日的　神、  

48:16 救赎我脱离一切患难的那使者、赐福与这两个童子、愿他们归在我的名下、和我祖亚伯拉罕、我父以撒的名下、又愿他们在世界中生养众多。  
48:17 约瑟见他父亲把右手按在以法莲的头上、就不喜悦、便提起他父亲的手、要从以法莲的头上挪到玛拿西的头上。  
48:18 约瑟对他父亲说、我父不是这样、这本是长子、求你把右手按在他的头上。  
48:19 他父亲不从、说、我知道、我儿、我知道、他也必成为一族、也必昌大。只是他的兄弟将来比他还大、他兄弟的后裔要成为多族。  
48:20 当日就给他们祝福、说、以色列人要指着你们祝福、说、愿　神使你如以法莲玛拿西一样。于是立以法莲在玛拿西以上。  

48:21 以色列又对约瑟说、我要死了、但　神必与你们同在、领你们回到你们列祖之地。  
48:22 并且我从前用弓用刀、从亚摩利人手下夺的那块地、我都赐给你、使你比众弟兄多得一分。

创世纪 49章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33

49:1 雅各叫了他的儿子们来、说、你们都来聚集、我好把你们日后必遇的事告诉你们。  
49:2 雅各的儿子们、你们要聚集而听、要听你们父亲以色列的话。  
49:3 流便哪、你是我的长子、是我力量强壮的时候生的、本当大有尊荣、权力超众。  
49:4 但你放纵情欲、滚沸如水、必不得居首位、因为你上了你父亲的床、污秽了我的榻。  
49:5 西缅和利未是弟兄、他们的刀剑是残忍的器具。  

49:6 我的灵阿、不要与他们同谋、我的心哪、不要与他们联络、因为他们趁怒杀害人命、任意砍断牛腿大筋。  
49:7 他们的怒气暴烈可咒。他们的忿恨残忍可诅。我要使他们分居在雅各家里、散住在以色列地中。  
49:8 犹大阿、你弟兄们必赞美你、你手必掐住仇敌的颈项、你父亲的儿子们必向你下拜。  
49:9 犹大是个小狮子。我儿阿、你抓了食便上去。你屈下身去、卧如公狮、蹲如母狮、谁敢惹你。  
49:10 圭必不离犹大、杖必不离他两脚之间、直等细罗〔就是赐平安者〕来到、万民都必归顺。  

49:11 犹大把小驴拴在葡萄树上、把驴驹拴在美好的葡萄树上、他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服、在葡萄汁中洗了袍褂。  
49:12 他的眼睛必因酒红润、他的牙齿必因奶白亮。  
49:13 西布伦必住在海口、必成为停船的海口。他的境界必延到西顿。  
49:14 以萨迦是个强壮的驴、卧在羊圈之中。  
49:15 他以安静为佳、以肥地为美、便低肩背重、成为服苦的仆人。  

49:16 但必判断他的民、作以色列支派之一。  
49:17 但必作道上的蛇、路中的虺、咬伤马蹄、使骑马的坠落于后。  
49:18 耶和华阿、我向来等候你的救恩。  
49:19 迦得必被敌军追逼、他却要追逼他们的脚跟。  
49:20 亚设之地必出肥美的粮食、且出君王的美味。  

49:21 拿弗他利是被释放的母鹿、他出嘉美的言语。  
49:22 约瑟是多结果子的树枝、是泉旁多结果的枝子、他的枝条探出墙外。  
49:23 弓箭手将他苦害、向他射箭、逼迫他。  
49:24 但他的弓仍旧坚硬、他的手健壮敏捷。这是因以色列的牧者、以色列的磐石、就是雅各的大能者。  
49:25 你父亲的　神、必帮助你、那全能者、必将天上所有的福、地里所藏的福、以及生产乳养的福、都赐给你。  

49:26 你父亲所祝的福、胜过我祖先所祝的福、如永世的山岭、至极的边界、这些福必降在约瑟的头上、临列那与弟兄迥别之人的顶上。  
49:27 便雅悯是个撕掠的狼、早晨要吃他所抓的、晚上要分他所夺的。  
49:28 这一切是以色列的十二支派。这也是他们的父亲对他们所说的话、为他们所祝的福、都是按着各人的福分、为他们祝福。  
49:29 他又嘱咐他们说、我将要归到我列祖〔原文作本民〕那里、你们要将我葬在赫人以弗仑田间的洞里、与我祖我父在一处、  
49:30 就是在迦南地幔利前、麦比拉田间的洞。那洞和田、是亚伯拉罕向赫人以弗仑买来为业、作坟地的。  

49:31 他们在那里葬了亚伯拉罕和他妻子撒拉。又在那里葬了以撒、和他妻子利百加。我也在那里葬了利亚。  
49:32 那块田和田间的洞、原是向赫人买的。  
49:33 雅各嘱咐众子已毕、就把脚收在床上、气绝而死、归到列祖〔原文作本民〕那里去了。

创世纪 50章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26

50:1 约瑟伏在他父亲的面上哀哭、与他亲嘴。  
50:2 约瑟吩咐伺候他的医生、用香料薰他父亲、医生就用香料薰了以色列。  
50:3 薰尸的常例是四十天、那四十天满了、埃及人为他哀哭了七十天。  
50:4 为他哀哭的日子过了、约瑟对法老家中的人说、我若在你们眼前蒙恩、请你们报告法老说、  
50:5 我父亲要死的时候、叫我起誓、说、你要将我葬在迦南地、在我为自己所掘的坟墓里。现在求你让我上去葬我父亲、以后我必回来。  

50:6 法老说、你可以上去、照着你父亲叫你起的誓、将他葬埋。  
50:7 于是约瑟上去葬他父亲。与他一同上去的、有法老的臣仆、和法老家中的长老、并埃及国的长老。  
50:8 还有约瑟的全家、和他的弟兄们、并他父亲的眷属、只有他们的妇人、孩子、和羊群、牛群、都留在歌珊地。  
50:9 又有车辆、马兵、和他一同上去。那一帮人甚多。  
50:10 他们到了约但河外、亚达的禾场、就在那里大大的号咷痛哭。约瑟为他父亲哀哭了七天。  

50:11 迦南的居民、见亚达禾场上的哀哭、就说、这是埃及人一场大的哀哭、因此那地方名叫亚伯麦西、是在约但河东。  
50:12 雅各的儿子们、就遵着他父亲所吩咐的办了、  
50:13 把他搬到迦南地、葬在幔利前、麦比拉田间的洞里。那洞和田、是亚伯拉罕向赫人以弗仑买来为业作坟地的。  
50:14 约瑟葬了他父亲以后、就和众弟兄、并一切同他上去葬他父亲的人、都回埃及去了。  
50:15 约瑟的哥哥们见父亲死了、就说、或者约瑟怀恨我们、照着我们从前待他一切的恶、足足的报复我们。  

50:16 他们就打发人去见约瑟说、你父亲未死以先、吩咐说、  
50:17 你们要对约瑟这样说、从前你哥哥们恶待你、求你饶恕他们的过犯、和罪恶。如今求你饶恕你父亲　神之仆人的过犯。他们对约瑟说这话、约瑟就哭了。  
50:18 他的哥哥们又来俯伏在他面前说、我们是你的仆人。  
50:19 约瑟对他们说、不要害怕、我岂能代替　神呢。  
50:20 从前你们的意思是要害我、但　神的意思原是好的、要保全许多人的性命、成就今日的光景。  

50:21 现在你们不要害怕、我必养活你们、和你们的妇人、孩子。于是约瑟用亲爱的话安慰他们。  
50:22 约瑟和他父亲的眷属、都住在埃及。约瑟活了一百一十岁。  
50:23 约瑟得见以法莲第三代的子孙。玛拿西的孙子玛吉的儿子、也养在约瑟的膝上。  
50:24 约瑟对他弟兄们说、我要死了、但　神必定看顾你们、领你们从这地上去、到他起誓所应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各之地。  
50:25 约瑟叫以色列的子孙起誓、说、　神必定看顾你们、你们要把我的骸骨从这里搬上去。  

50:26 约瑟死了、正一百一十岁。人用香料将他薰了、把他收殓在棺材里、停在埃及。
