4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.  
4:2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:  
4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.  
4:4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.  
4:5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.  

4:6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.  
4:7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.  
4:8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.  
4:9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.  
4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.  

4:11 <a class ="blue">Beloved</a>, if God so <a class ="blue">loved</a> us, we ought also to <a class ="blue">love</a> one another.  
4:12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we <a class ="blue">love</a> one another, God dwelleth in us, and his <a class ="blue">love</a> is perfected in us.  
4:13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.  
4:14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.  
4:15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.  

4:16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.  
4:17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.  
4:18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.  
4:19 We love him, because he first loved us.  
4:20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?  

4:21 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.

4:1 亲爱的弟兄阿、一切的灵、你们不可都信。总要试验那些灵是出于　神的不是。因为世上有许多假先知已经出来了。  
4:2 凡灵认耶稣基督是成了肉身来的、就是出于　神的。从此你们可以认出　神的灵来。  
4:3 凡灵不认耶稣、就不是出于　神。这是那敌基督者的灵。你们从前听见他要来。现在已经在世上了。  
4:4 小子们哪、你们是属　神的、并且胜了他们。因为那在你们里面的、比那在世界上的更大。  
4:5 他们是属世界的。所以论世界的事、世人也听从他们。  

4:6 我们是属　神的。认识　神的就听从我们。不属　神的就不听从我们。从此我们可以认出真理的灵、和谬妄的灵来。  
4:7 亲爱的弟兄阿、我们应当彼此相爱。因为爱是从　神来的。凡有爱心的、都是由　神而生、并且认识　神。  
4:8 没有爱心的、就不认识　神。因为　神就是爱。  
4:9 　神差他独生子到世间来、使我们借着他得生、　神爱我们的心、在此就显明了。  
4:10 不是我们爱　神、乃是　神爱我们、差他的儿子、为我们的罪作了挽回祭、这就是爱了。  

4:11 亲爱的弟兄阿、　神既是这样爱我们、我们也当彼此相爱。  
4:12 从来没有人见过　神。我们若彼此相爱、　神就住在我们里面、爱他的心在我们里面得以完全了。  
4:13 　神将他的灵赐给我们、从此就知道我们是住在他里面、他也住在我们里面。  
4:14 父差子作世人的救主、这是我们所看见且作见证的。  
4:15 凡认耶稣为　神儿子的、　神就住在他里面、他也住在　神里面。  

4:16 　神爱我们的心、我们也知道也信。　神就是爱。住在爱里面的、就是住在　神里面、　神也住在他里面。  
4:17 这样、爱在我们里面得以完全、我们就可以在审判的日子、坦然无惧。因为他如何、我们在这世上也如何。  
4:18 爱里没有惧怕。爱既完全、就把惧怕除去。因为惧怕里含着刑罚。惧怕的人在爱里未得完全。  
4:19 我们爱、因为　神先爱我们。  
4:20 人若说、我爱　神、却恨他的弟兄、就是说谎话的。不爱他所看见的弟兄、就不能爱没有看见的　神。〔有古卷作怎能爱没有看见的　神呢〕  

4:21 爱　神的、也当爱弟兄、这是我们从　神所受的命令。
