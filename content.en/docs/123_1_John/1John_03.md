3:1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.  
3:2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.  
3:3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.  
3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.  
3:5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.  

3:6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.  
3:7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.  
3:8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.  
3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.  
3:10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.  

3:11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.  
3:12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.  
3:13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.  
3:14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.  
3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.  

3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.  
3:17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?  
3:18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.  
3:19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.  
3:20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.  

3:21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.  
3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.  
3:23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.  
3:24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.

3:1 你看父赐给我们是何等的慈爱、使我们得称为　神的儿女。我们也真是他的儿女。世人所以不认识我们、是因未曾认识他。  
3:2 亲爱的弟兄阿、我们现在是　神的儿女、将来如何、还未显明。但我们知道主若显现、我们必要像他。因为必得见他的真体。  
3:3 凡向他有这指望的、就洁净自己、像他洁净一样。  
3:4 凡犯罪的、就是违背律法。违背律法就是罪。  
3:5 你们知道主曾显现、是要除掉人的罪。在他并没有罪。  

3:6 凡住在他里面的、就不犯罪。凡犯罪的、是未曾看见他、也未曾认识他。  
3:7 小子们哪、不要被人诱惑、行义的才是义人。正如主是义的一样。  
3:8 犯罪的是属魔鬼、因为魔鬼从起初就犯罪。　神的儿子显现出来、为要除灭魔鬼的作为。  
3:9 凡从　神生的、就不犯罪、因　神的道〔原文作种〕存在他心里。他也不能犯罪、因为他是由　神生的。  
3:10 从此就显出谁是　神的儿女、谁是魔鬼的儿女。凡不行义的、就不属　神。不爱弟兄的也是如此。  

3:11 我们应当彼此相爱。这就是你们从起初所听见的命令。  
3:12 不可像该隐。他是属那恶者、杀了他的兄弟。为甚么杀了他呢。因自己的行为是恶的、兄弟的行为是善的。  
3:13 弟兄们、世人若恨你们、不要以为希奇。  
3:14 我们因为爱弟兄、就晓得是已经出死入生了。没有爱心的、仍住在死中。  
3:15 凡恨他弟兄的、就是杀人的。你们晓得凡杀人的、没有永生存在他里面。  

3:16 主为我们舍命、我们从此就知道何为爱。我们也当为弟兄舍命。  
3:17 凡有世上财物的、看见弟兄穷乏、却塞住怜恤的心、爱　神的心怎能存在他里面呢。  
3:18 小子们哪、我们相爱、不要只在言语和舌头上。总要在行为和诚实上。  
3:19 从此、就知道我们是属真理的、并且我们的心在　神面前可以安稳。  
3:20 我们的心若责备我们、　神比我们的心大、一切事没有不知道的。  

3:21 亲爱的弟兄阿、我们的心若不责备我们、就可以向　神坦然无惧了。  
3:22 并且我们一切所求的、就从他得着。因为我们遵守他的命令、行他所喜悦的事。  
3:23 　神的命令就是叫我们信他儿子耶稣基督的名、且照他所赐给我们的命令彼此相爱。  
3:24 遵守　神命令的、就住在　神里面。　神也住在他里面。我们所以知道　神住在我们里面、是因他所赐给我们的圣灵。
