1:1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;  
1:2 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)
1:3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.  
1:4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. [1 John 1:4 NLT] <a class ="marginnote">verse 4: The NLT seems to say: Our joy will be filled in you.  This verse sets the tone of the letter.  The apostle voluntarily gave up their right and became the bond-slave to Christ, because they were drawn to God by His love.</a>  
1:5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.  

1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:  
1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.  
1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  
1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  
1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

1:1 论到从起初原有的生命之道、就是我们所听见所看见、亲眼看过、亲手摸过的。  
1:2 （这生命已经显现出来、我们也看见过、现在又作见证、将原与父同在、且显现与我们那永远的生命、传给你们。)  
1:3 我们将所看见、所听见的、传给你们、使你们与我们相交、我们乃是与父并他儿子耶稣基督相交的。  
1:4 我们将这些话写给你们、使你们〔有古卷作我们〕的喜乐充足。  
1:5 　神就是光、在他毫无黑暗。这是我们从主所听见、又报给你们的信息。  

1:6 我们若说是与　神相交、却仍在黑暗里行、就是说谎话、不行真理了。  
1:7 我们若在光明中行、如同　神在光明中、就彼此相交、他儿子耶稣的血也洗净我们一切的罪。  
1:8 我们若说自己无罪、便是自欺、真理不在我们心里了。  
1:9 我们若认自己的罪、　神是信实的、是公义的、必要赦免我们的罪、洗净我们一切的不义。  
1:10 我们若说自己没有犯过罪、便是以　神为说谎的。他的道也不在我们心里了。
