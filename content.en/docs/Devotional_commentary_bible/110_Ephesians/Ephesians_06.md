6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.  
6:2 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;  
6:3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.  
6:4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.  
6:5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;  
 
6:6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;  
6:7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:  
6:8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.  
6:9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.  
6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.  
 
6:11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  
6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.  
6:13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.  
6:14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;  
6:15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;  
 
6:16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.  
6:17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:  
6:18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;  
6:19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,  
6:20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.  
 
6:21 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:  
6:22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.  
6:23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
6:24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.

6:1 你们作儿女的、要在主里听从父母、这是理所当然的。  
6:2 要孝敬父母、使你得福、在世长寿。这是第一条带应许的诫命。  
6:3 见上节
6:4 你们作父亲的、不要惹儿女的气、只要照着主的教训和警戒、养育他们。  
6:5 你们作仆人的、要惧怕战兢、用诚实的心听从你们肉身的主人、好像听从基督一般。  

6:6 不要只在眼前事奉、像是讨人喜欢的、要像基督的仆人、从心里遵行　神的旨意。  
6:7 甘心事奉、好像服事主、不像服事人。  
6:8 因为晓得各人所行的善事、不论是为奴的、是自主的、都必按所行的得主的赏赐。  
6:9 你们作主人的待仆人、也是一理、不要威吓他们。因为知道他们和你们、同有一位主在天上、他并不偏待人。  
6:10 我还有末了的话、你们要靠着主、倚赖他的大能大力、作刚强的人。  

6:11 要穿戴　神所赐的全副军装、就能抵挡魔鬼的诡计。  
6:12 因我们并不是与属血气的争战、乃是与那些执政的、掌权的、管辖这幽暗世界的、以及天空属灵气的恶魔争战。〔两争战原文都作摔跤〕  
6:13 所以要拿起　神所赐的全副军装、好在磨难的日子、抵挡仇敌、并且成就了一切、还能站立得住。  
6:14 所以要站稳了、用真理当作带子束腰、用公义当作护心镜遮胸。  
6:15 又用平安的福音、当作预备走路的鞋穿在脚上。  

6:16 此外又拿着信德当作藤牌、可以灭尽那恶者一切的火箭。  
6:17 并戴上救恩的头盔、拿着圣灵的宝剑、就是　神的道。  
6:18 靠着圣灵、随时多方祷告祈求、并要在此儆醒不倦、为众圣徒祈求、  
6:19 也为我祈求、使我得着口才、能以放胆、开口讲明福音的奥秘、  
6:20 （我为这福音的奥秘、作了带锁链的使者)并使我照着当尽的本分、放胆讲论。  

6:21 今有所亲爱忠心事奉主的兄弟推基古、他要把我的事情并我的景况如何、全告诉你们叫你们知道。  
6:22 我特意打发他到你们那里去、好叫你们知道我们的光景、又叫他安慰你们的心。  
6:23 愿平安、仁爱、信心、从父　神和主耶稣基督、归与弟兄们。  
6:24 并愿所有诚心爱我们主耶稣基督的人、都蒙恩惠。
