Hi, this is Joni Eareckson Tada with a word about healing.

Because often I meet people who ask, “Joni, don’t you want to get healed?” Well, duh—I wouldn’t be human if I didn't want to get healed. And, in fact, there was a season in my life when I begged God to heal me. I would say for the first, oh, five to ten years in my wheelchair, it was the major deal in all my prayers, and when it appeared that I would never walk again, I still kept praying for healing; I at least wanted my hands to get healed. And one of the key verses I used in my prayers was John 14:13-14 where Jesus says, "I will do whatever you ask in my name so that the Son may bring glory to the Father." Well, that was quite a promise! Jesus will give us whatever we ask, as long as we ask in his name?!

Well, I kept doing just that—asking in his name, but nothing happened, so I dug deeper, confessing, repenting of whatever extra sin might stand in the way. But still, my feet and my hands did not respond. I wondered what I was doing wrong. I don’t know, maybe you've experienced that same thing with that verse. You've asked for something important—like healing or whatever—you ask it in Jesus’ name, and you ask it, that it might bring glory to God, but still, all you get is silence or perhaps the reply from God is, "no." “But Jesus,” you think, “you said you would do whatever I ask in your name. What gives?!”

<div class = "quote">

So I went back to John 14, and this time I read all the way around it. I discovered that the context is all about "giving the Gospel." After all, this chapter was our Savior's last chance to teach his disciples about **the main thing**. And **the main thing**, we'd all agree, is his Gospel. Jesus was so passionate about his disciples giving the Good News, that he inasmuch said, “Look, if there are mountains in your way, I’ll move them. If there’s an obstacle in your path, I’ll help you get rid of it. If it means advancing the kingdom of God, I’ll do it.” Jesus was adamant about this because this is what would give his Father the most glory.

Once this fact sank in, it made my wheelchair seem insignificant in comparison. My problems didn’t seem so important. What’s more, **I began to grasp the fact that my paralysis was part of God's strategy to further his Gospel**. After all, it says in 1 Peter 2:21-22, "To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps." Just as Christ suffered yet trusted the Father, I am to follow in his steps on the road marked with suffering and trust my heavenly Father, even with quadriplegia.

And it’s a lesson for you. When we Christians trust the Lord in our hardships, it showcases to a skeptical, cynical, and unbelieving world that God is worth trusting and the Bible is worth believing. The world cannot argue when it sees people in pain rejoice in their God. Friend, no one goes to Christ’s heaven who does not first share in Christ’s sufferings. And there’s a good reason for it. Heaven is going to be populated with people who opened their eyes to God because they saw the power and the reality of his Gospel demonstrated through you. And that’s worth being healed on your feet any day.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this important topic of healing. Just go to my radio page at joniradio.org. And, hey, if you have experienced an extraordinary physical healing, I rejoice with you! Just remember to make that part of your testimony, because the important thing is not primarily your healing, but that it is used to advance the Gospel of Christ. Let’s keep **the main thing** **the main thing**!

<b><font class = "font_upper">my thoughts</font></b>  
It is not only healing, but also other things that bother us, or things that we are so eager to get it, that we pray to God.  There are other prayers in Bible seeming that God will answer our prayers, such as Jeremiah 33:3. However, God wants us to put Him at the first priority, put His will at the first priority, just as Matthew 6:31-33.  God knows our need because of His love, grace, and mercy, He will provide them at the right timing.   

Interestingly Joni saw her accident as a part of God's strategy to further His gospel.  Do I see myself as a part of God's strategy to preach gospel once I join in His family?  Do I preach the gospel while I am looking for a job?  Do I preach the gospel to the family members while I stay at home?  To go beyond that, I ask myself, am I the walking gospel?

Then I go over this question again: What is the gospel?    
1) First of all, it is the good news of Jesus' coming down and saving us from sin, so that we can be free from dying in the sin;   
2) Secondly, it is about the power of transformation.  The gospel can change me.  If I still prayed for the benefit for myself, and there was no change in me, the gospel would not be a good news.  God is not the Lord, but a servant of me;
