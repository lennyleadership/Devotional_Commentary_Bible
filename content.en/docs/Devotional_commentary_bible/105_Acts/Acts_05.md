5:1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,  
5:2 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.  
5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?  
5:4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.  
5:5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.  

5:6 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.  
5:7 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.  
5:8 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.  
5:9 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.  
5:10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.  

5:11 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.  
5:12 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.  
5:13 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.  
5:14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)  
5:15 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.  

5:16 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.  
5:17 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,  
5:18 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.  
5:19 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,  
5:20 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.  

5:21 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.  
5:22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,  
5:23 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.  
5:24 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.  
5:25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.  

5:26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.  
5:27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,  
5:28 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.  
5:29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.  
5:30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.  

5:31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.  
5:32 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.  
5:33 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.  
5:34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;  
5:35 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.  

5:36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.  
5:37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.  
5:38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:  
5:39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.  
5:40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.  

5:41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.  
5:42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

5:1 有一个人、名叫亚拿尼亚、同他的妻子撒非喇、卖了田产。  
5:2 把价银私自留下几分、他的妻子也知道、其余的几分、拿来放在使徒脚前。  
5:3 彼得说、亚拿尼亚为甚么撒但充满了你的心、叫你欺哄圣灵、把田地的价银私自留下几分呢。  
5:4 田地还没有卖、不是你自己的么。既卖了、价银不是你作主么。你怎么心里起这意念呢。你不是欺哄人、是欺哄　神了。  
5:5 亚拿尼亚听见这话、就仆倒断了气。听见的人都甚惧怕。  

5:6 有些少年人起来、把他包裹抬出去埋葬了。  
5:7 约过了三小时、他的妻子进来、还不知道这事。  
5:8 彼得对他说、你告诉我、你们卖田地的价银、就是这些么。他说、就是这些。  
5:9 彼得说、你们为甚么同心试探主的灵呢。埋葬你丈夫之人的脚、已到门口、他们也要把你抬出去。  
5:10 妇人立刻仆倒在彼得脚前、断了气。那些少年人进来、见他已经死了、就抬出去、埋在他丈夫旁边。  

5:11 全教会、和听见这事的人、都甚惧怕。  
5:12 主借使徒的手、在民间行了许多神迹奇事、（他们〔或作信的人〕都同心合意的在所罗门的廊下。  
5:13 其余的人、没有一个敢贴近他们。百姓却尊重他们。  
5:14 信而归主的人、越发增添、连男带女很多)
5:15 甚至有人将病人抬到街上、放在床上、或褥子上、指望彼得过来的时候、或者得他的影儿照在甚么人身上。  

5:16 还有许多人、带着病人、和被污鬼缠磨的、从耶路撒冷四围的城邑来、全都得了医治。  
5:17 大祭司和他的一切同人、就是撒都该教门的人、都起来、满心忌恨。  
5:18 就下手拿住使徒、收在外监。  
5:19 但主的使者、夜间开了监门、领他们出来、  
5:20 说、你们去站在殿里、把这生命的道、都讲给百姓听。  

5:21 使徒听了这话、天将亮的时候、就进殿里去教训人。大祭司和他的同人来了、叫齐公会的人、和以色列族的众长老、就差人到监里去、要把使徒提出来。  
5:22 但差役到了、不见他们在监里、就回来禀报说、  
5:23 我们看见监牢关得极妥当、看守的人也站在门外、及至开了门、里面一个人都不见。  
5:24 守殿官和祭司长听见这话、心里犯难、不知这事将来如何。  
5:25 有一个人来禀报说、你们收在监里的人、现在站在殿里教训百姓。  

5:26 于是守殿官和差役去带使徒来、并没有用强暴。因为怕百姓用石头打他们。  
5:27 带到了、便叫使徒站在公会前、大祭司问他们说、  
5:28 我们不是严严的禁止你们、不可奉这名教训人么。你们倒把你们的道理充满了耶路撒冷、想要叫这人的血归到我们身上。  
5:29 彼得和众使徒回答说、顺从　神、不顺从人、是应当的。  
5:30 你们挂在木头上杀害的耶稣、我们祖宗的　神已经叫他复活。  

5:31 　神且用右手将他高举、〔或作他就是　神高举在自己的右边〕叫他作君王、作救主、将悔改的心、和赦罪的恩、赐给以色列人。  
5:32 我们为这事作见证。　神赐给顺从之人的圣灵、也为这事作见证。  
5:33 公会的人听见就极其恼怒、想要杀他们。  
5:34 但有一个法利赛人、名叫迦玛列、是众百姓所敬重的教法师、在公会中站起来、吩咐人把使徒暂且带到外面去。  
5:35 就对众人说、以色列人哪、论到这些人、你们应当小心怎样办理。  

5:36 从前丢大起来、自夸为大。附从他的人约有四百。他被杀后、附从他的全都散了、归于无有。  
5:37 此后报名上册的时候、又有加利利的犹大起来、引诱些百姓跟从他、他也灭亡、附从他的人也都四散了。  
5:38 现在我劝你们不要管这些人、任凭他们吧。他们所谋的、所行的、若是出于人、必要败坏。  
5:39 若是出于　神、你们就不能败坏他们。恐怕你们倒是攻击　神了。  
5:40 公会的人听从了他、便叫使徒来、把他们打了、又吩咐他们不可奉耶稣的名讲道、就把他们释放了。  

5:41 他们离开公会、心里欢喜。因被算是配为这名受辱。  
5:42 他们就每日在殿里、在家里、不住的教训人、传耶稣是基督。
