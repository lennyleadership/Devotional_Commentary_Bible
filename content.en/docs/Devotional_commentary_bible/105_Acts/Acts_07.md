7:1 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?  
7:2 And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,  
7:3 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.  
7:4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.  
7:5 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.  

7:6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.  
7:7 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.  
7:8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.  
7:9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,  
7:10 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.  

7:11 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.  
7:12 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.  
7:13 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.  
7:14 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.  
7:15 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,  

7:16 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.  
7:17 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,  
7:18 Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.  
7:19 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.  
7:20 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:  

7:21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.  
7:22 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.  
7:23 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.  
7:24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:  
7:25 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.  

7:26 And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?  
7:27 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?  
7:28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?  
7:29 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.  
7:30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.  

7:31 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,  
7:32 Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.  
7:33 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.  
7:34 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.  
7:35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.  

7:36 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.  
7:37 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.  
7:38 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:  
7:39 To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and <a class = "red">in their hearts turned back again into Egypt</a>,  
7:40 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  

7:41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.  
7:42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?  
7:43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.  
7:44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.  
7:45 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;  

7:46 Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.  
7:47 But Solomon built him an house.  
7:48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,  
7:49 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?  
7:50 Hath not my hand made all these things?  

7:51 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.  
7:52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:  
7:53 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.  
7:54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.  
7:55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,  

7:56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.  
7:57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,  
7:58 And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.  
7:59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.  
7:60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

7:1 大祭司就说、这些事果然有么。  
7:2 司提反说、诸位父兄请听。当日我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕在米所波大米还未住哈兰的时候、荣耀的　神向他显现、  
7:3 对他说、『你要离开本地和亲族、往我所要指示你的地方去。』  
7:4 他就离开迦勒底人之地住在哈兰。他父亲死了以后、　神使他从那里搬到你们现在所住之地。  
7:5 在这地方　神并没有给他产业、连立足之地也没有给他。但应许要将这地赐给他和他的后裔为业。那时他还没有儿子。  

7:6 　神说、他的后裔、必寄居外邦、那里的人、要叫他们作奴仆、苦待他们四百年。  
7:7 　神又说、使他们作奴仆的那国、我要惩罚、以后他们要出来、在这地方事奉我。  
7:8 　神又赐他割礼的约。于是亚伯拉罕生了以撒、第八日给他行了割礼。以撒生雅各、雅各生十二位先祖。  
7:9 先祖嫉妒约瑟、把他卖到埃及去。　神却与他同在、  
7:10 救他脱离一切苦难、又使他在埃及王法老面前、得恩典有智慧。法老就派他作埃及国的宰相兼管全家。  

7:11 后来埃及和迦南全地遭遇饥荒、大受艰难、我们的祖宗、就绝了粮。  
7:12 雅各听见在埃及有粮、就打发我们的祖宗、初次往那里去。  
7:13 第二次约瑟与弟兄们相认、他的亲族也被法老知道了。  
7:14 约瑟就打发弟兄请父亲雅各、和全家七十五个人都来。  
7:15 于是雅各下了埃及、后来他和我们的祖宗都死在那里。  

7:16 又被带到示剑、葬于亚伯拉罕在示剑用银子从哈抹子孙买来的坟墓里。  
7:17 及至　神应许亚伯拉罕的日期将到、以色列民在埃及兴盛众多、  
7:18 直到有不晓得约瑟的新王兴起。  
7:19 他用诡计待我们的宗族、苦害我们的祖宗、叫他们丢弃婴孩、使婴孩不能存活。  
7:20 那时、摩西生下来、俊美非凡、在他父亲家里抚养了三个月。  

7:21 他被丢弃的时候、法老的女儿拾了去、养为自己的儿子。  
7:22 摩西学了埃及人一切的学问、说话行事、都有才能。  
7:23 他将到四十岁、心中起意、去看望他的弟兄以色列人。  
7:24 到了那里、见他们一个人受冤屈、就护庇他、为那受欺压的人报仇、打死了那埃及人。  
7:25 他以为弟兄必明白　神是借他的手搭救他们。他们却不明白。  

7:26 第二天、遇见两个以色列人争斗、就劝他们和睦、说、你们二位是弟兄、为甚么彼此欺负呢。  
7:27 那欺负邻舍的、把他推开说、『谁立你作我们的首领、和审判官呢。  
7:28 难道你要杀我、像昨天杀那埃及人么。』  
7:29 摩西听见这话就逃走了、寄居于米甸。在那里生了两个儿子。  
7:30 过了四十年、在西乃山的旷野、有一位天使、从荆棘火焰中、向摩西显现。  

7:31 摩西见了那异象、便觉希奇。正进前观看的时候、有主的声音说、  
7:32 『我是你列祖的　神、就是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神。』摩西战战兢兢、不敢观看。  
7:33 主对他说、『把你脚上的鞋脱下来。因为你所站之地是圣地。  
7:34 我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦、我实在看见了。他们悲叹的声音、我也听见了。我下来要救他们、你来、我要差你往埃及去。』  
7:35 这摩西、就是百姓弃绝说、谁立你作我们的首领、和审判官的。　神却借那在荆棘中显现之使者的手、差派他作首领、作救赎的。  

7:36 这人领百姓出来、在埃及、在红海、在旷野、四十年间行了奇事神迹。  
7:37 那曾对以色列人说、『　神要从你们弟兄中间、给你们兴起一位先知像我的、』就是这位摩西。  
7:38 这人曾在旷野会中、和西乃山上与那对他说话的天使同在、又与我们的祖宗同在、并且领受活泼的圣言传给我们。  
7:39 我们的祖宗不肯听从、反弃绝他、心里归向埃及、  
7:40 对亚伦说、『你且为我们造些神像、在我们前面引路。因为领我们出埃及地的那个摩西、我们不知道他遭了甚么事。』  

7:41 那时、他们造了一个牛犊、又拿祭物献给那像、欢喜自己手中的工作。  
7:42 　神就转脸不顾、任凭他们事奉天上的日月星辰、正如先知书上所写的说、『以色列家阿、你们四十年间在旷野、岂是将牺牲和祭物献给我么。  
7:43 你们抬着摩洛的帐幕、和理番神的星。就是你们所造为要敬拜的像。因此、我要把你们迁到巴比伦外去。』  
7:44 我们的祖宗在旷野、有法柜的帐幕、是　神吩咐摩西叫他照所看见的样式作的。  
7:45 这帐幕、我们的祖宗相继承受、当　神在他们面前赶出外邦人去的时候、他们同约书亚把帐幕搬进承受为业之地、直存到大卫的日子。  

7:46 大卫在　神面前蒙恩、祈求为雅各的　神预备居所。  
7:47 却是所罗门为　神造成殿宇。  
7:48 其实至高者并不住人手所造的。就如先知所言、  
7:49 『主说、天是我的座位、地是我的脚凳。你们要为我造何等的殿宇、那里是我安息的地方呢。  
7:50 这一切不都是我手所造的么。』  

7:51 你们这硬着颈项、心与耳未受割礼的人、常时抗拒圣灵。你们的祖宗怎样、你们也怎样。  
7:52 那一个先知、不是你们祖宗逼迫呢。他们也把预先传说那义者要来的人杀了。如今你们又把那义者卖了、杀了。  
7:53 你们受了天使所传的律法、竟不遵守
7:54 众人听见这话、就极其恼怒、向司提反咬牙切齿。  
7:55 但司提反被圣灵充满、定睛望天、看见　神的荣耀、又看见耶稣站在　神的右边。  

7:56 就说、我看见天开了、人子站在　神的右边。  
7:57 众人大声喊叫、摀着耳朵、齐心拥上前去。  
7:58 把他推到城外、用石头打他。作见证的人、把衣裳放在一个少年人名叫扫罗的脚前。  
7:59 他们正用石头打的时候、司提反呼吁主说、求主耶稣接收我的灵魂。  
7:60 又跪下大声喊着说、主阿、不要将这罪归于他们。说了这话、就睡了。扫罗也喜悦他被害。
