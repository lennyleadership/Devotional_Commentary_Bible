19:1 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,  
19:2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.  
19:3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.  
19:4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.  
19:5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.  

19:6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.  
19:7 And all the men were about twelve.  
19:8 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.  
19:9 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.  
19:10 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.  

19:11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:  
19:12 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.  
19:13 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.  
19:14 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.  
19:15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?  

19:16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.  
19:17 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  
19:18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.  
19:19 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.  
19:20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.  

19:21 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.  
19:22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.  
19:23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.  
19:24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;  
19:25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.  

19:26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:  
19:27 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.  
19:28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.  
19:29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.  
19:30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.  

19:31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.  
19:32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.  
19:33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.  
19:34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.  
19:35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?  

19:36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.  
19:37 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.  
19:38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.  
19:39 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.  
19:40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.  

19:41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

19:1 亚波罗在哥林多的时候、保罗经过了上边一带地方、就来到以弗所。在那里遇见几个门徒。  
19:2 问他们说、你们信的时候、受了圣灵没有。他们回答说、没有、也未曾听见有圣灵赐下来。  
19:3 保罗说、这样、你们受的是甚么洗呢。他们说、是约翰的洗。  
19:4 保罗说、约翰所行的是悔改的洗、告诉百姓、当信那在他以后要来的、就是耶稣。  
19:5 他们听见这话、就奉主耶稣的名受洗。  

19:6 保罗按手在他们头上、圣灵便降在他们身上。他们就说方言、又说预言。〔或作又讲道〕
19:7 一共约有十二个人。  
19:8 保罗进会堂、放胆讲道、一连三个月、辩论　神国的事、劝化众人。  
19:9 后来有些人、心里刚硬不信、在众人面前毁谤这道、保罗就离开他们、也叫门徒与他们分离、便在推喇奴的学房、天天辩论。  
19:10 这样有两年之久、叫一切住在亚西亚的、无论是犹太人、是希利尼人、都听见主的道。  

19:11 　神借保罗的手、行了些非常的奇事。  
19:12 甚至有人从保罗身上拿手巾、或围裙、放在病人身上、病就退了、恶鬼也出去了。  
19:13 那时、有几个游行各处、念咒赶鬼的犹太人、向那被恶鬼附的人、擅自称主耶稣的名、说、我奉保罗所传的耶稣、敕令你们出来。  
19:14 作这事的、有犹太祭司长士基瓦的七个儿子。  
19:15 恶鬼回答他们说、耶稣我认识、保罗我也知道。你们却是谁呢。  

19:16 恶鬼所附的人、就跳在他们身上、胜了其中二人、制伏他们、叫他们赤着身子受了伤、从那房子里逃出去了。  
19:17 凡住在以弗所的、无论是犹太人、是希利尼人、都知道这事、也都惧怕、主耶稣的名从此就尊大了。  
19:18 那已经信的、多有人来承认诉说自己所行的事。  
19:19 平素行邪术的、也有许多人把书拿来、堆积在众人面前焚烧。他们算计书价、便知道共合五万块钱。  
19:20 主的道大大兴旺而且得胜、就是这样。  

19:21 这些事完了、保罗心里定意、经过了马其顿亚该亚、就往耶路撒冷去、又说、我到了那里以后、也必须往罗马去看看。  
19:22 于是从帮助他的人中、打发提摩太以拉都二人、往马其顿去。自己暂时等在亚西亚。  
19:23 那时、因为这道起的扰乱不小。  
19:24 有一个银匠、名叫底米丢、是制造亚底米神银龛的、他使这样手艺人生意发达。  
19:25 他聚集他们和同行的工人、说、众位、你们知道我们是倚靠这生意发财。  

19:26 这保罗不但在以弗所、也几乎在亚西亚全地、引诱迷惑许多人、说、人手所作的不是神、这是你们所看见所听见的。  
19:27 这样、不独我们这事业、被人藐视、就是大女神亚底米的庙、也要被人轻忽、连亚西亚全地、和普天下、所敬拜的大女神之威荣、也要消灭了。  
19:28 众人听见、就怒气填胸、喊着说、大哉以弗所人的亚底米阿。  
19:29 满城都轰动起来。众人拿住与保罗同行的马其顿人该犹、和亚里达古、齐心拥进戏园里去。  
19:30 保罗想要进去、到百姓那里、门徒却不许他去。  

19:31 还有亚西亚几位首领、是保罗的朋友、打发人来劝他、不要冒险到戏园里去。  
19:32 聚集的人、纷纷乱乱、有喊叫这个的、有喊叫那个的、大半不知道是为甚么聚集。  
19:33 有人把亚力山大从众人中带出来、犹太人推他往前、亚力山大就摆手、要向百姓分诉。  
19:34 只因他们认出他是犹太人、就大家同声喊着说、大哉以弗所人的亚底米阿。如此约有两小时。  
19:35 那城里的书记、安抚了众人、就说、以弗所人哪、谁不知道以弗所人的城、是看守大亚底米的庙、和从丢斯那里落下来的像呢。  

19:36 这事既是驳不倒的、你们就当安静、不可造次。  
19:37 你们把这些人带来、他们并没有偷窃庙中之物、也没有谤讟我们的女神。  
19:38 若是底米丢和他同行的人、有控告人的事、自有放告的日子。〔或作自有公堂〕也有方伯、可以彼此对告。  
19:39 你们若问别的事、就可以照常例聚集断定。  
19:40 今日的扰乱、本是无缘无故、我们难免被查问。论到这样聚众、我们也说不出所以然来。  

19:41 说了这话、便叫众人散去。
