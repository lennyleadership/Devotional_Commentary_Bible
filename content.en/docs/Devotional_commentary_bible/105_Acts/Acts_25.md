25:1 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.  
25:2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,  
25:3 And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.  
25:4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.  
25:5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.  

25:6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.  
25:7 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.  
25:8 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.  
25:9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?  
25:10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.  

25:11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.  
25:12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.  
25:13 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.  
25:14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:  
25:15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.  

25:16 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.  
25:17 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.  
25:18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:  
25:19 But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.  
25:20 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.  

25:21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.  
25:22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.  
25:23 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.  
25:24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.  
25:25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.  

25:26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.  
25:27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.

25:1 非斯都到了任、过了三天、就从该撒利亚上耶路撒冷去。  
25:2 祭司长、和犹太人的首领、向他控告保罗、  
25:3 又央告他、求他的情、将保罗提到耶路撒冷来。他们要在路上埋伏杀害他。  
25:4 非斯都却回答说、保罗押在该撒利亚、我自己快要往那里去。  
25:5 又说、你们中间有权势的人、与我一同下去、那人若有甚么不是、就可以告他。  

25:6 非斯都在他们那里、住了不过十天八天、就下该撒利亚去。第二天坐堂、吩咐将保罗提上来。  
25:7 保罗来了、那些从耶路撒冷下来的犹太人、周围站着、将许多重大的事控告他、都是不能证实的。  
25:8 保罗分诉说、无论犹太人的律法、或是圣殿、或是该撒、我都没有干犯。  
25:9 但非斯都要讨犹太人的喜欢、就问保罗说、你愿意上耶路撒冷去、在那里听我审断这事么。  
25:10 保罗说、我站在该撒的堂前、这就是我应当受审的地方。我向犹太人并没有行过甚么不义的事、这也是你明明知道的。  

25:11 我若行了不义的事、犯了甚么该死的罪、就是死、我也不辞。他们所告我的事若都不实、就没有人可以把我交给他们。我要上告于该撒。  
25:12 非斯都和议会商量了、就说、你既上告于该撒、可以往该撒那里去。  
25:13 过了些日子、亚基帕王、和百尼基氏、来到该撒利亚、问非斯都安。  
25:14 在那里住了多日、非斯都将保罗的事告诉王、说、这里有一个人、是腓力斯留在监里的。  
25:15 我在耶路撒冷的时候、祭司长和犹太的长老、将他的事禀报了我、求我定他的罪。  

25:16 我对他们说、无论甚么人、被告还没有和原告对质、未得机会分诉所告他的事、就先定他的罪、这不是罗马人的条例。  
25:17 及至他们都来到这里、我就不耽延、第二天便坐堂、吩咐把那人提上来。  
25:18 告他的人站着告他。所告的、并没有我所逆料的那等恶事。  
25:19 不过是有几样辩论、为他们自己敬鬼神的事、又为一个人名叫耶稣、是已经死了、保罗却说他是活着的。  
25:20 这些事当怎样究问、我心里作难。所以问他说、你愿意上耶路撒冷去、在那里为这些事听审么。  

25:21 但保罗求我留下他要听皇上审断、我就吩咐把他留下、等我解他到该撒那里去。  
25:22 亚基帕对非斯都说、我自己也愿听这人辩论。非斯都说、明天你可以听。  
25:23 第二天、亚基帕和百尼基大张威势而来、同着众千夫长、和城里的尊贵人、进了公厅。非斯都吩咐一声、就有人将保罗带进来。  
25:24 非斯都说、亚基帕王、和在这里的诸位阿、你们看这人、就是一切犹太人在耶路撒冷、和这里、曾向我恳求、呼叫说、不可容他再活着。  
25:25 但我查明他没有犯甚么该死的罪。并且他自己上告于皇帝、所以我定意把他解去。  

25:26 论到这人、我没有确实的事、可以奏明主上。因此我带他到你们面前、也特意带他到你亚基帕王面前、为要在查问之后、有所陈奏。  
25:27 据我看来、解送囚犯、不指明他的罪案、是不合理的。
