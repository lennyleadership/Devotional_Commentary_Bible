3:1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.  
3:2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;  
3:3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.  
3:4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.  
3:5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.  

3:6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.  
3:7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.  
3:8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.  
3:9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:  
3:10 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.  

3:11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.  
3:12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?  
3:13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.  
3:14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;  
3:15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.  

3:16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.  
3:17 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.  
3:18 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.  
3:19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;  
3:20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:  

3:21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.  
3:22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.  
3:23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.  
3:24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.  
3:25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.  

3:26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.

3:1 申初祷告的时候、彼得、约翰、上圣殿去。  
3:2 有一个人、生来是瘸腿的、天天被人抬来、放在殿的一个门口、那门名叫美门、要求进殿的人赒济。  
3:3 他看见彼得约翰将要进殿、就求他们赒济。  
3:4 彼得约翰定睛看他。彼得说、你看我们。  
3:5 那人就留意看他们、指望得着甚么。  

3:6 彼得说、金银我都没有、只把我所有的给你、我奉拿撒勒人耶稣基督的名、叫你起来行走。  
3:7 于是拉着他的右手、扶他起来、他的脚和踝子骨、立刻健壮了。  
3:8 就跳起来、站着、又行走。同他们进了殿、走着、跳着、赞美　神。  
3:9 百姓都看见他行走、赞美　神。  
3:10 认得他是那素常坐在殿的美门口求赒济的。就因他所遇着的事、满心希奇惊讶。  

3:11 那人正在称为所罗门的廊下、拉着彼得、约翰。众百姓一齐跑到他们那里、很觉希奇。  
3:12 彼得看见、就对百姓说、以色列人哪、为甚么把这事当作希奇呢。为甚么定睛看我们、以为我们凭自己的能力和虔诚、使这人行走呢。  
3:13 亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的　神、就是我们列祖的　神、已经荣耀了他的仆人耶稣。〔仆人或作儿子〕你们却把他交付彼拉多。彼拉多定意要释放他、你们竟在彼拉多面前弃绝了他。  
3:14 你们弃绝了那圣洁公义者、反求着释放一个凶手给你们。  
3:15 你们杀了那生命的主、　神却叫他从死里复活了。我们都是为这事作见证。  

3:16 我们因信他的名、他的名便叫你们所看见所认识的这人、健壮了。正是他所赐的信心、叫这人在你们众人面前全然好了。  
3:17 弟兄们、我晓得你们作这事、是出于不知、你们的官长也是如此。  
3:18 但　神曾借众先知的口、预言基督将要受害、就这样应验了。  
3:19 所以你们当悔改归正、使你们的罪得以涂抹、这样、那安舒的日子、就必从主面前来到。  
3:20 主也必差遣所预定给你们的基督耶稣降临。  

3:21 天必留他、等到万物复兴的时候、就是　神从创世以来、借着圣先知的口所说的。  
3:22 摩西曾说、『主　神要从你们弟兄中间、给你们兴起一位先知像我、凡他向你们所说的、你们都要听从。  
3:23 凡不听从那先知的、必要从民中全然灭绝。』  
3:24 从撒母耳以来的众先知、凡说预言的、也都说到这些日子。  
3:25 你们是先知的子孙、也承受　神与你们祖宗所立的约、就是对亚伯拉罕说、地上万族、都要因你的后裔得福。  

3:26 　神既兴起他的仆人、〔或作儿子〕就先差他到你们这里来、赐福给你们、叫你们各人回转、离开罪恶。
