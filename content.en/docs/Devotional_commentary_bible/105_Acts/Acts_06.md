6:1 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.  
6:2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.  
6:3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.  
6:4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.  
6:5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:  

6:6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.  
6:7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.  
6:8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.  
6:9 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.  
6:10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.  

6:11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.  
6:12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,  
6:13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:  
6:14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.  
6:15 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

6:1 那时、门徒增多、有说希利尼话的犹太人、向希伯来人发怨言。因为在天天的供给上忽略了他们的寡妇。  
6:2 十二使徒叫众门徒来、对他们说、我们撇下　神的道、去管理饭食、原是不合宜的。  
6:3 所以弟兄们、当从你们中间选出七个有好名声、被圣灵充满、智慧充足的人、我们就派他们管理这事。  
6:4 但我们要专心以祈祷传道为事。  
6:5 大众都喜悦这话、就拣选了司提反、乃是大有信心、圣灵充满的人、又拣选腓利、伯罗哥罗、尼迦挪、提门、巴米拿、并进犹太教的安提阿人尼哥拉。  

6:6 叫他们站在使徒面前。使徒祷告了、就按手在他们头上。  
6:7 　神的道兴旺起来。在耶路撒冷门徒数目加增的甚多。也有许多祭司信从了这道。  
6:8 司提反满得恩惠能力、在民间行了大奇事和神迹。  
6:9 当时有称利百地拿会堂的几个人、并有古利奈、亚力山太、基利家、亚西亚、各处会堂的几个人、都起来、和司提反辩论。  
6:10 司提反是以智慧和圣灵说话、众人敌挡不住。  

6:11 就买出人来说、我们听见他说谤讟摩西、和　神的话。  
6:12 他们又耸动了百姓、长老、并文士、就忽然来捉拿他、把他带到公会去、  
6:13 设下假见证说、这个人说话、不住的糟践圣所和律法。  
6:14 我们曾听见他说、这拿撒勒人耶稣、要毁坏此地、也要改变摩西所交给我们的规条。  
6:15 在公会里坐着的人、都定睛看他、见他的面貌、好像天使的面貌。
