2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.  
2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.  
2:3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.  
2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.  
2:5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.  

2:6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.  
2:7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?  
2:8 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  
2:9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  
2:10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  

2:11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  
2:12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  
2:13 Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  
2:14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  
2:15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.  

2:16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  
2:17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  
2:18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  
2:19 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  
2:20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  

2:21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  
2:22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  
2:23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  
2:24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  
2:25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  

2:26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  
2:27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  
2:28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  
2:29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  
2:30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  

2:31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  
2:32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  
2:33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  
2:34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  
2:35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  

2:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  
2:37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  
2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  
2:39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.  
2:40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.  

2:41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  
2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  
2:43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.  
2:44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  
2:45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.  

2:46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  
2:47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

2:1 五旬节到了、门徒都聚集在一处。  
2:2 忽然从天上有响声下来、好像一阵大风吹过、充满了他们所坐的屋子。  
2:3 又有舌头如火焰显现出来、分开落在他们各人头上。  
2:4 他们就都被圣灵充满、按着圣灵所赐的口才、说起别国的话来。  
2:5 那时、有虔诚的犹太人、从天下各国来、住在耶路撒冷。  

2:6 这声音一响、众人都来聚集、各人听见门徒用众人的乡谈说话、就甚纳闷。  
2:7 都惊讶希奇说、看哪、这说话的不都是加利利人么。  
2:8 我们各人、怎么听见他们说我们生来所用的乡谈呢。  
2:9 我们帕提亚人、玛代人、以拦人、和住在米所波大米、犹太、加帕多家、本都、亚西亚、  
2:10 弗吕家、旁非利亚、埃及的人、并靠近古利奈的吕彼亚一带地方的人、从罗马来的客旅中、或是犹太人、或是进犹太教的人、  

2:11 革哩底和亚拉伯人、都听见他们用我们的乡谈、讲说　神的大作为。  
2:12 众人就都惊讶猜疑、彼此说、这是甚么意思呢。  
2:13 还有人讥诮说、他们无非是新酒灌满了。  
2:14 彼得和十一个使徒、站起、高声说、犹太人、和一切住在耶路撒冷的人哪、这件事你们当知道、也当侧耳听我的话。  
2:15 你们想这些人是醉了、其实不是醉了、因为时候刚到巳初。  

2:16 这正是先知约珥所说的。  
2:17 『　神说、在末后的日子、我要将我的灵浇灌凡有血气的。你们的儿女要说预言。你们的少年人要见异象。老年人要作异梦。  
2:18 在那些日子、我要将我的灵浇灌我的仆人和使女、他们就要说预言。  
2:19 在天上我要显出奇事、在地下我要显出神迹、有血、有火、有烟雾。  
2:20 日头要变为黑暗、月亮要变为血、这都在主大而明显的日子未到以前。  

2:21 到那时候、凡求告主名的、就必得救。』  
2:22 以色列人哪、请听我的话。　神借着拿撒勒人耶稣、在你们中间施行异能奇事神迹、将他证明出来、这是你们自己知道的。  
2:23 他既按着　神的定旨先见、被交与人、你们就借着无法之人的手、把他钉在十字架上杀了。  
2:24 　神却将死的痛苦解释了、叫他复活。因为他原不能被死拘禁。  
2:25 大卫指着他说、『我看见主常在我眼前、他在我右边、叫我不至于摇动。  

2:26 所以我心里欢喜、我的灵〔原文作舌〕快乐。并且我的肉身要安居在指望中。  
2:27 因你必不将我的灵魂撇在阴间、也不叫你的圣者见朽坏。  
2:28 你已将生命的道路指示我、必叫我因见你的面、〔或作叫我在你面前〕得着满足的快乐。』  
2:29 弟兄们、先祖大卫的事、我可以明明的对你们说、他死了、也葬埋了、并且他的坟墓、直到今日还在我们这里。  
2:30 大卫既是先知、又晓得　神曾向他起誓、要从他的后裔中、立一位坐在他的宝座上。  

2:31 就预先看明这事、讲论基督复活说、他的灵魂、不撇在阴间、他的肉身、也不见朽坏、  
2:32 这耶稣、　神已经叫他复活了、我们都为这事作见证。  
2:33 他既被　神的右手高举、〔或作他既高举在　神的右边〕又从父受了所应许的圣灵、就把你们所看见所听见的、浇灌下来。  
2:34 大卫并没有升到天上、但自己说、『主对我主说、你坐在我的右边、  
2:35 等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。』  

2:36 故此、以色列全家当确实的知道、你们钉在十字架上的这位耶稣、　神已经立他为主为基督了。  
2:37 众人听见这话、觉得扎心、就对彼得和其余的使徒说、弟兄们、我们当怎样行。  
2:38 彼得说、你们各人要悔改、奉耶稣基督的名受洗、叫你们的罪得赦、就必领受所赐的圣灵。  
2:39 因为这应许是给你们、和你们的儿女、并一切在远方的人、就是主我们　神所召来的。  
2:40 彼得还用许多话作见证、劝勉他们说、你们当救自己脱离这弯曲的世代。  

2:41 于是领受他话的人、就受了洗。那一天、门徒约添了三千人。  
2:42 都恒心遵守使徒的教训、彼此交接、擘饼、祈祷。  
2:43 众人都惧怕。使徒又行了许多奇事神迹。  
2:44 信的人都在一处、凡物公用。  
2:45 并且卖了田产家业、照各人所需用的分给各人。  

2:46 他们天天同心合意恒切的在殿里、且在家中擘饼、存着欢喜诚实的心用饭、  
2:47 赞美　神、得众民的喜爱。主将得救的人、天天加给他们。
