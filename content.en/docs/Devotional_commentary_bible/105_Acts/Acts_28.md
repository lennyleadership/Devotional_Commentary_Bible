28:1 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.  
28:2 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.  
28:3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.  
28:4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.  
28:5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.  

28:6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.  
28:7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.  
28:8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.  
28:9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:  
28:10 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.  

28:11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.  
28:12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.  
28:13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:  
28:14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.  
28:15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.  

28:16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.  
28:17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.  
28:18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.  
28:19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.  
28:20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.  

28:21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.  
28:22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.  
28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.  
28:24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.  
28:25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,  

28:26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:  
28:27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.  
28:28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.  
28:29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.  
28:30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,  

28:31 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.

28:1 我们既已得救、才知道那岛名叫米利大。  
28:2 土人看待我们、有非常的情分、因为当时下雨、天气又冷、就生火、接待我们众人。  
28:3 那时、保罗拾起一捆柴、放在火上、有一条毒蛇、因为热了出来、咬住他的手。  
28:4 土人看见那毒蛇、悬在他手上、就彼此说、这人必是个凶手、虽然从海里救上来、天理还不容他活着。  
28:5 保罗竟把那毒蛇甩在火里、并没有受伤。  

28:6 土人想他必要肿起来、或是忽然仆倒死了。看了多时、见他无害、就转念说、他是个神。  
28:7 离那地方不远、有田产是岛长部百流的。他接纳我们、尽情款待三日。  
28:8 当时、部百流的父亲、患热病和痢疾躺着。保罗进去、为他祷告、按手在他身上、治好了他。  
28:9 从此、岛上其余的病人、也来得了医治。  
28:10 他们又多方的尊敬我们。到了开船的时候、也把我们所需用的送到船上。  

28:11 过了三个月、我们上了亚力山太的船、往前行。这船以丢斯双子为记、是在那海岛过了冬的。  
28:12 到了叙拉古、我们停泊三日。  
28:13 又从那里绕行、来到利基翁。过了一天、起了南风、第二天就来到部丢利。  
28:14 在那里遇见弟兄们、请我们与他们同住了七天。这样、我们来到罗马。  
28:15 那里的弟兄们、一听见我们的信息、就出来到亚比乌市、和三馆地方迎接我们。保罗见了他们、就感谢　神、放心壮胆。  

28:16 进了罗马城、〔有古卷在此有百夫长把众囚犯交给御营的统领惟有〕保罗蒙准、和一个看守他的兵、另住在一处。  
28:17 过了三天、保罗请犹太人的首领来。他们来了、就对他们说、弟兄们、我虽没有作甚么事干犯本国的百姓、和我们祖宗的规条、却被锁绑、从耶路撒冷解在罗马人的手里。  
28:18 他们审问了我、就愿意释放我。因为在我身上、并没有该死的罪。  
28:19 无奈犹太人不服、我不得已、只好上告于该撒。并非有甚么事、要控告我本国的百姓。  
28:20 因此、我请你们来见面说话。我原为以色列人所指望的、被这链子捆锁。  

28:21 他们说、我们并没有接着从犹太来论你的信、也没有弟兄到这里来、报给我们说、你有甚么不好处。  
28:22 但我们愿意听你的意见如何。因为这教门、我们晓得是到处被毁谤的。  
28:23 他们和保罗约定了日子、就有许多人到他的寓处来、保罗从早到晚、对他们讲论这事、证明　神国的道、引摩西的律法和先知的书、以耶稣的事、劝勉他们。  
28:24 他所说的话、有信的、有不信的。  
28:25 他们彼此不合、就散了。未散以先、保罗说了一句话、说、圣灵借先知以赛亚、向你们祖宗所说的话、是不错的。  

28:26 他说、『你去告诉这百姓说、你们听是要听见、却不明白。看是要看见、却不晓得。  
28:27 因为这百姓、油蒙了心、耳朵发沉、眼睛闭着。恐怕眼睛看见、耳朵听见、心里明白、回转过来、我就医治他们。』  
28:28 所以你们当知道、　神这救恩、如今传给外邦人、他们也必听受。〔有古卷在此有〕
28:29 〔保罗说了这话犹太人议论纷纷的就走了〕
28:30 保罗在自己所租的房子里、住了足足两年。凡来见他的人、他全都接待、  

28:31 放胆传讲　神国的道、将主耶稣基督的事教导人、并没有人禁止。
