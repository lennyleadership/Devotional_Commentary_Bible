8:1 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.  
8:2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.  
8:3 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.  
8:4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.  
8:5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.  

8:6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.  
8:7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.  
8:8 And there was great joy in that city.  
8:9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:  
8:10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.  

8:11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.  
8:12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  
8:13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.  
8:14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:  
8:15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:  

8:16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)  
8:17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.  
8:18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,  
8:19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.  
8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.  

8:21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.  
8:22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.  
8:23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.  
8:24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.  
8:25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.  

8:26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.  
8:27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,  
8:28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.  
8:29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.  
8:30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?  

8:31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.  
8:32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:  
8:33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.  
8:34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?  
8:35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.  

8:36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?  
8:37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  
8:38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.  
8:39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.  
8:40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

8:1 从这日起、耶路撒冷的教会、大遭逼迫。除了使徒以外、门徒都分散在犹太和撒玛利亚各处。  
8:2 有虔诚的人、把司提反埋葬了、为他捶胸大哭。  
8:3 扫罗却残害教会、进各人的家、拉着男女下在监里。  
8:4 那些分散的人、往各处去传道。  
8:5 腓利下撒玛利亚城去、宣讲基督。  

8:6 众人听见了、又看见腓利所行的神迹、就同心合意的听从他的话。  
8:7 因为有许多人被污鬼附着、那些鬼大声呼叫、从他们身上出来。还有许多瘫痪的、瘸腿的、都得了医治。  
8:8 在那城里、就大有欢喜。  
8:9 有一个人、名叫西门、向来在那城里行邪术、妄自尊大、使撒玛利亚的百姓惊奇。  
8:10 无论大小、都听从他、说、这人就是那称为　神的大能者。  

8:11 他们听从他、因他久用邪术、使他们惊奇。  
8:12 及至他们信了腓利所传　神国的福音、和耶稣基督的名、连男带女就受了洗。  
8:13 西门自己也信了。既受了洗、就常与腓利在一处。看见他所行的神迹和大异能、就甚惊奇。  
8:14 使徒在耶路撒冷、听见撒玛利亚人领受了　神的道、就打发彼得约翰往他们那里去。  
8:15 两个人到了、就为他们祷告、要叫他们受圣灵。  

8:16 因为圣灵还没有降在他们一个人身上。他们只奉主耶稣的名受了洗。  
8:17 于是使徒按手在他们头上、他们就受了圣灵。  
8:18 西门看见使徒按手、便有圣灵赐下。就拿钱给使徒、  
8:19 说、把这权柄也给我、叫我手按着谁、谁就可以受圣灵。  
8:20 彼得说、你的银子、和你一同灭亡吧。因你想　神的恩赐、是可以用钱买的。  

8:21 你在这道上、无分无关。因为在　神面前、你的心不正。  
8:22 你当懊悔你这罪恶、祈求主。或者你心里的意念可得赦免。  
8:23 我看出你正在苦胆之中、被罪恶捆绑。  
8:24 西门说、愿你们为我求主、叫你们所说的、没有一样临到我身上。  
8:25 使徒既证明主道、而且传讲、就回耶路撒冷去、一路在撒玛利亚好些村庄传扬福音。  

8:26 有主的一个使者对腓利说、起来、向南走、往那从耶路撒冷下迦萨的路上去。那路是旷野。  
8:27 腓利就起身去了。不料、有一个埃提阿伯〔即古实见以赛亚十八章一节〕人、是个有大权的太监、在埃提阿伯女王干大基的手下总管银库、他上耶路撒冷礼拜去了。  
8:28 现在回来、在车上坐着、念先知以赛亚的书。  
8:29 圣灵对腓利说、你去贴近那车走。  
8:30 腓利就跑到太监那里、听见他念先知以赛亚的书、便问他说、你所念的、你明白么。  

8:31 他说、没有人指教我、怎能明白呢。于是请腓利上车、与他同坐。  
8:32 他所念的那段经、说、『他像羊被牵到宰杀之地、又像羊羔在剪毛的人手下无声、他也是这样不开口。  
8:33 他卑微的时候、人不按公义审判他。〔原文作他的审判被夺去〕谁能述说他的世代、因为他的生命从地上夺去。』  
8:34 太监对腓利说、请问、先知说这话、是指着谁、是指着自己呢、是指着别人呢。  
8:35 腓利就开口从这经上起、对他传讲耶稣。  

8:36 二人正往前走、到了有水的地方。太监说、看哪、这里有水、我受洗有甚么妨碍呢。〔有古卷在此有
8:37 腓利说、你若是一心相信、就可以。他回答说我信耶稣基督是　神的儿子〕
8:38 于是吩咐车站住、腓利和太监二人同下水里去、腓利就给他施洗。  
8:39 从水里上来、主的灵把腓利提了去、太监也不再见他了、就欢欢喜喜的走路。  
8:40 后来有人在亚锁都遇见腓利、他走遍那地方、在各城宣传福音、直到该撒利亚。
