18:1 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;  
18:2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.  
18:3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.  
18:4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.  
18:5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.  

18:6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.  
18:7 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.  
18:8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.  
18:9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:  
18:10 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.  

18:11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.  
18:12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,  
18:13 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.  
18:14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:  
18:15 But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.  

18:16 And he drave them from the judgment seat.  
18:17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.  
18:18 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.  
18:19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.  
18:20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;  

18:21 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.  
18:22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.  
18:23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.  
18:24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.  
18:25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.  

18:26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.  
18:27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:  
18:28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

18:1 这事以后、保罗离了雅典、来到哥林多。  
18:2 遇见一个犹太人、名叫亚居拉、他生在本都。因为革老丢命犹太人都离开罗马、新近带着妻百基拉、从义大利来。保罗就投奔了他们。  
18:3 他们本是制造帐棚为业。保罗因与他们同业、就和他们同住作工。  
18:4 每逢安息日、保罗在会堂里辩论、劝化犹太人和希利尼人。  
18:5 西拉和提摩太从马其顿来的时候、保罗为道迫切、向犹太人证明耶稣是基督。  

18:6 他们既抗拒、毁谤、保罗就抖着衣裳说、你们的罪归到你们自己头上、〔罪原文作血〕与我无干、〔原文作我却干净〕从今以后、我要往外邦人那里去、  
18:7 于是离开那里、到了一个人的家中、这人名叫提多犹士都、是敬拜　神的、他的家靠近会堂。  
18:8 管会堂的基利司布和全家都信了主。还有许多哥林多人听了、就相信受洗。  
18:9 夜间主在异象中对保罗说、不要怕、只管讲、不要闭口。  
18:10 有我与你同在、必没有人下手害你。因为在这城里我有许多的百姓。  

18:11 保罗在那里住了一年零六个月、将　神的道教训他们。  
18:12 到迦流作亚该亚方伯的时候、犹太人同心起来攻击保罗、拉他到公堂、  
18:13 说、这个人劝人不按着律法敬拜　神。  
18:14 保罗刚要开口、迦流就对犹太人说、你们这些犹太人、如果是为冤枉、或奸恶的事、我理当耐性听你们。  
18:15 但所争论的、若是关乎言语、名目、和你们的律法、你们自己去办吧。这样的事我不愿意审问。  

18:16 就把他们撵出公堂。  
18:17 众人便揪住管会堂的所提尼、在堂前打他。这些事迦流都不管。  
18:18 保罗又住了多日、就辞别了弟兄、坐船往叙利亚去、百基拉、亚居拉和他同去。他因为许过愿、就在坚革哩剪了头发。  
18:19 到了以弗所、保罗就把他们留在那里、自己进了会堂、和犹太人辩论。  
18:20 众人请他多住些日子、他却不允。  

18:21 就辞别他们说、　神若许我、我还要回到你们这里。于是开船离了以弗所。  
18:22 在该撒利亚下了船、就上耶路撒冷去问教会安、随后下安提阿去。  
18:23 住了些日子、又离开那里、挨次经过加拉太和弗吕家地方、坚固众门徒。  
18:24 有一个犹太人、名叫亚波罗、来到以弗所。他生在亚力山太、是有学问的、最能讲解圣经。〔学问或作口才〕
18:25 这人已经在主的道上受了教训、心里火热、将耶稣的事、详细讲论教训人。只是他单晓得约翰的洗礼。  

18:26 他在会堂里放胆讲道、百基拉亚居拉听见、就接他来、将　神的道给他讲解更加详细。  
18:27 他想要往亚该亚去。弟兄们就勉励他、并写信请门徒接待他。〔或作弟兄们就写信劝门徒接待他〕他到了那里、多帮助那蒙恩信主的人。  
18:28 在众人面前极有能力、驳倒犹太人、引圣经证明耶稣是基督。
