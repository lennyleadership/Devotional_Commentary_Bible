17:1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:  
17:2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,  
17:3 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.  
17:4 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.  
17:5 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.  

17:6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;  
17:7 Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.  
17:8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.  
17:9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.  
17:10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.  

17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.  
17:12 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.  
17:13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.  
17:14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.  
17:15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.  

17:16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.  
17:17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.  
17:18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.  
17:19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  
17:20 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.  

17:21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)  
17:22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.  
17:23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.  
17:24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;  
17:25 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;  

17:26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;  
17:27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:  
17:28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.  
17:29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.  
17:30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:  

17:31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.  
17:32 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.  
17:33 So Paul departed from among them.  
17:34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

17:1 保罗和西拉、经过暗妃波里、亚波罗尼亚、来到帖撒罗尼迦、在那里有犹太人的会堂。  
17:2 保罗照他素常的规矩进去、一连三个安息日、本着圣经与他们辩论、  
17:3 讲解陈明基督必须受害、从死里复活。又说、我所传与你们的这位耶稣、就是基督。  
17:4 他们中间有些人听了劝、就附从保罗和西拉。并有许多虔敬的希利尼人、尊贵的妇女也不少。  
17:5 但那不信的犹太人心里嫉妒、招聚了些市井匪类、搭伙成群、耸动合城的人、闯进耶孙的家、要将保罗西拉带到百姓那里。  

17:6 找不着他们、就把耶孙、和几个弟兄、拉到地方官那里、喊叫说、那搅乱天下的、也到这里来了。  
17:7 耶孙收留他们。这些人都违背该撒的命令、说另有一个王耶稣。  
17:8 众人和地方官、听见这话、就惊慌了。  
17:9 于是取了耶孙和其余之人的保状、就释放了他们。  
17:10 弟兄们、随即在夜间打发保罗和西拉往庇哩亚去。二人到了、就进入犹太人的会堂。  

17:11 这地方的人、贤于帖撒罗尼迦的人、甘心领受这道、天天考查圣经、要晓得这道是与不是。  
17:12 所以他们中间多有相信的。又有希利尼尊贵的妇女、男子也不少。  
17:13 但帖撒罗尼迦的犹太人、知道保罗又在庇哩亚传　神的道、也就往那里去、耸动搅扰众人。  
17:14 当时弟兄们便打发保罗往海边去。西拉和提摩太仍住在庇哩亚。  
17:15 送保罗的人带他到了雅典。既领了保罗的命、叫西拉和提摩太速速到他这里来、就回去了。  

17:16 保罗在雅典等候他们的时候、看见满城都是偶像、就心里着急。  
17:17 于是在会堂里、与犹太人、和虔敬的人、并每日在市上所遇见的人辩论。  
17:18 还有以彼古罗和斯多亚两门的学士、与他争论。有的说、这胡言乱语的要说甚么。有的说、他似乎是传说外邦鬼神的。这话是因保罗传讲耶稣、与复活的道。  
17:19 他们就把他带到亚略巴古说、你所讲的这新道、我们也可以知道么。  
17:20 因为你有些奇怪的事、传到我们耳中。我们愿意知道这些事是甚么意思。  

17:21 （雅典人、和住在那里的客人、都不顾别的事、只将新闻说说听听。)
17:22 保罗站在亚略巴古当中、说、众位雅典人哪、我看你们凡事很敬畏鬼神。  
17:23 我游行的时候、观看你们所敬拜的、遇见一座坛、上面写着未识之神。你们所不认识而敬拜的、我现在告诉你们。  
17:24 创造宇宙和其中万物的　神、既是天地的主、就不住人手所造的殿。  
17:25 也不用人手服事、好像缺少甚么、自己倒将生命、气息、万物、赐给万人。  

17:26 他从一本造出万族的人、〔本有古卷作血脉〕住在全地上、并且预先定准他们的年限、和所住的疆界。  
17:27 要叫他们寻求　神、或者可以揣摩而得、其实他离我们各人不远。  
17:28 我们生活、动作、存留、都在乎他。就如你们作诗的、有人说、我们也是他所生的。  
17:29 我们既是　神所生的、就不当以为　神的神性像人用手艺、心思、所雕刻的金、银、石。  
17:30 世人蒙昧无知的时候、　神并不监察、如今却吩咐各处的人都要悔改。  

17:31 因为他已经定了日子、要借着他所设立的人、按公义审判天下。并且叫他从死里复活、给万人作可信的凭据。  
17:32 众人听见从死里复活的话、就有讥诮他的。又有人说、我们再听你讲这个吧。  
17:33 于是保罗从他们当中出去了。  
17:34 但有几个人贴近他、信了主、其中有亚略巴古的官丢尼修、并一个妇人、名叫大马哩、还有别人一同信从。
