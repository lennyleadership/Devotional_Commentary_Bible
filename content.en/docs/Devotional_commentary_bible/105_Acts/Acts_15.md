15:1 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.  
15:2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.  
15:3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.  
15:4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.  
15:5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.  

15:6 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.  
15:7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.  
15:8 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;  
15:9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.  
15:10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?  

15:11 But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.  
15:12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.  
15:13 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:  
15:14 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.  
15:15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,  

15:16 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:  
15:17 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.  
15:18 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.  
15:19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:  
15:20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.  

15:21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.  
15:22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:  
15:23 And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:  
15:24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:  
15:25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,  

15:26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
15:27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.  
15:28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;  
15:29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.  
15:30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:  

15:31 Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.  
15:32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.  
15:33 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.  
15:34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.  
15:35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.  

15:36 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.  
15:37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.  
15:38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.  
15:39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;  
15:40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.  

15:41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.

15:1 有几个人、从犹太下来、教训弟兄们说、你们若不按摩西的规条受割礼、不能得救。  
15:2 保罗巴拿巴与他们大大的分争辩论、众门徒就定规、叫保罗巴拿巴和本会中几个人、为所辩论的、上耶路撒冷去、见使徒和长老。  
15:3 于是教会送他们起行、他们经过腓尼基、撒玛利亚、随处传说外邦人归主的事、叫众弟兄都甚欢喜。  
15:4 到了耶路撒冷、教会和使徒并长老、都接待他们、他们就述说　神同他们所行的一切事。  
15:5 惟有几个信徒是法利赛教门的人、起来说、必须给外邦人行割礼、吩咐他们遵守摩西的律法。  

15:6 使徒和长老、聚会商议这事。  
15:7 辩论已经多了、彼得就起来、说、诸位弟兄、你们知道　神早已在你们中间拣选了我、叫外邦人从我口中得听福音之道、而且相信。  
15:8 知道人心的　神、也为他们作了见证。赐圣灵给他们、正如给我们一样。  
15:9 又借着信洁净了他们的心、并不分他们我们。  
15:10 现在为甚么试探　神、要把我们祖宗和我们所不能负的轭、放在门徒的颈项上呢。  

15:11 我们得救、乃是因主耶稣的恩、和他们一样、这是我们所信的。  
15:12 众人都默默无声、听巴拿巴和保罗、述说　神借他们在外邦人中所行的神迹奇事。  
15:13 他们住了声、雅各就说、诸位弟兄、请听我的话。  
15:14 方才西门述说　神当初怎样眷顾外邦人、从他们中间选取百姓归于自己的名下。  
15:15 众先知的话、也与这意思相合。  

15:16 正如经上所写的、『此后我要回来、重新修造大卫倒塌的帐幕、把那破坏的、重新修造建立起来。  
15:17 叫余剩的人、就是凡称为我名下的外邦人、都寻求主。  
15:18 这话是从创世以来、显明这事的主说的。』  
15:19 所以据我的意见、不可难为那归服　神的外邦人。  
15:20 只要写信、吩咐他们禁戒偶像的污秽和奸淫、并勒死的牲畜、和血。  

15:21 因为从古以来、摩西的书在各城有人传讲、每逢安息日、在会堂里诵读。  
15:22 那时、使徒和长老并全教会、定意从他们中间拣选人、差他们和保罗、巴拿巴、同往安提阿去。所拣选的、就是称呼巴撒巴的犹大、和西拉、这两个人在弟兄中是作首领的。  
15:23 于是写信交付他们、内中说、使徒和作长老的弟兄们、问安提阿、叙利亚、基利家外邦众弟兄的安。  
15:24 我们听说有几个人、从我们这里出去、用言语搅扰你们、惑乱你们的心。〔有古卷在此有你们必须受割礼守摩西的律法〕其实我们并没有吩咐他们。  
15:25 所以我们同心定意、拣选几个人、差他们同我们所亲爱的巴拿巴、和保罗、往你们那里去。  

15:26 这二人是为我主耶稣基督的名、不顾性命的。  
15:27 我们就差了犹大和西拉、他们也要亲口诉说这些事。  
15:28 因为圣灵和我们、定意不将别的重担放在你们身上。惟有几件事是不可少的、  
15:29 就是禁戒祭偶像的物、和血、并勒死的牲畜、和奸淫。这几件你们若能自己禁戒不犯、就好了。愿你们平安。  
15:30 他们既奉了差遣、就下安提阿去、聚集众人、交付书信。  

15:31 众人念了、因为信上安慰的话、就欢喜了。  
15:32 犹大和西拉也是先知、就用许多话劝勉弟兄、坚固他们。  
15:33 住了些日子、弟兄们打发他们平平安安的回到差遣他们的人那里去。〔有古卷在此有〕
15:34 〔惟有西拉定意仍住在那里〕
15:35 但保罗和巴拿巴、仍住在安提阿、和许多别人一同教训人、传主的道。  

15:36 过了些日子、保罗对巴拿巴说、我们可以回到从前宣传主道的各城、看望弟兄们景况如何。  
15:37 巴拿巴有意、要带称呼马可的约翰同去。  
15:38 但保罗、因为马可从前在旁非利亚离开他们、不和他们同去作工、就以为不可带他去。  
15:39 于是二人起了争论、甚至彼此分开。巴拿巴带着马可、坐船往居比路去。  
15:40 保罗拣选了西拉、也出去、蒙弟兄们把他交于主的恩中。  

15:41 他就走遍叙利亚、基利家、坚固众教会。
