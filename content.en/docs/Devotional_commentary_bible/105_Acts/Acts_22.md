22:1 Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.  
22:2 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)  
22:3 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.  
22:4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.  
22:5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.  

22:6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.  
22:7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?  
22:8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.  
22:9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.  
22:10 And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.  

22:11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.  
22:12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,  
22:13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.  
22:14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.  
22:15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.  

22:16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.  
22:17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;  
22:18 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.  
22:19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:  
22:20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.  

22:21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.  
22:22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.  
22:23 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,  
22:24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.  
22:25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?  

22:26 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.  
22:27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.  
22:28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.  
22:29 Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.  
22:30 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

22:1 诸位父兄请听、我现在对你们分诉。  
22:2 众人听他说的是希伯来话、就更加安静了。  
22:3 保罗说、我原是犹太人、生在基利家的大数、长在这城里、在迦玛列门下、按着我们祖宗严紧的律法受教、热心事奉　神、像你们众人今日一样。  
22:4 我也曾逼迫奉这道的人、直到死地、无论男女都锁拿下监。  
22:5 这是大祭司和众长老都可以给我作见证的。我又领了他们达与弟兄的书信、往大马色去、要把在那里奉这道的人锁拿、带到耶路撒冷受刑。  

22:6 我将到大马色、正走的时候、约在晌午、忽然从天上发大光、四面照着我。  
22:7 我就仆倒在地、听见有声音对我说、扫罗、扫罗、你为甚么逼迫我。  
22:8 我回答说、主阿、你是谁。他说、我就是你所逼迫的拿撒勒人耶稣。  
22:9 与我同行的人、看见了那光、却没有听明那位对我说话的声音。  
22:10 我说、主阿、我当作甚么。主说、起来、进大马色去、在那里要将所派你作的一切事、告诉你。  

22:11 我因那光的荣耀、不能看见、同行的人、就拉着我手进了大马色。  
22:12 那里有一个人、名叫亚拿尼亚、按着律法是虔诚人、为一切住在那里的犹太人所称赞。  
22:13 他来见我、站在旁边、对我说、兄弟扫罗、你可以看见。我当时往上一看、就看见了他。  
22:14 他又说、我们祖宗的　神、拣选了你、叫你明白他的旨意、又得见那义者、听他口中所出的声音。  
22:15 因为你要将所看见的、所听见的、对着万人为他作见证。  

22:16 现在你为甚么耽延呢、起来、求告他的名受洗、洗去你的罪。  
22:17 后来我回到耶路撒冷、在殿里祷告的时候、魂游象外、  
22:18 看见主向我说、你赶紧的离开耶路撒冷、不可迟延、因你为我作的见证、这里的人、必不领受。  
22:19 我就说、主阿、他们知道我从前把信你的人、收在监里、又在各会堂里鞭打他们。  
22:20 并且你的见证人司提反、被害流血的时候、我也站在旁边欢喜。又看守害死他之人的衣裳。  

22:21 主向我说、你去吧。我要差你远远的往外邦人那里去。  
22:22 众人听他说到这句话、就高声说、这样的人、从世上除掉他吧。他是不当活着的。  
22:23 众人喧嚷、摔掉衣裳、把尘土向空中扬起来。  
22:24 千夫长就吩咐将保罗带进营楼去、叫人用鞭子拷问他、要知道他们向他这样喧嚷、是为甚么缘故。  
22:25 刚用皮条捆上、保罗对旁边站着的百夫长说、人是罗马人、又没有定罪、你们就鞭打他、有这个例吗。  

22:26 百夫长听见这话、就去见千夫长、告诉他说、你要作甚么。这人是罗马人。  
22:27 千夫长就来问保罗说、你告诉我、你是罗马人么。保罗说、是。  
22:28 千夫长说、我用许多银子、才入了罗马的民籍。保罗说、我生来就是。  
22:29 于是那些要拷问保罗的人、就离开他去了。千夫长既知道他是罗马人、又因为捆绑了他、也害怕了。  
22:30 第二天、千夫长为要知道犹太人控告保罗的实情、便解开他、吩咐祭司长和全公会的人、都聚集、将保罗带下来、叫他站在他们面前。
