4:1 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,  
4:2 Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.  
4:3 And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.  
4:4 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.  
4:5 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,  

4:6 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.  
4:7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?  
4:8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,  
4:9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;  
4:10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.  

4:11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.  
4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.  
4:13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.  
4:14 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.  
4:15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,  

4:16 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.  
4:17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.  
4:18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.  
4:19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.  
4:20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.  

4:21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.  
4:22 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.  
4:23 And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.  
4:24 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:  
4:25 Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?  

4:26 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.  
4:27 For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,  
4:28 For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.  
4:29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,  
4:30 By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.  

4:31 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.  
4:32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.  
4:33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.  
4:34 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,  
4:35 And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.  

4:36 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,  
4:37 Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.

4:1 使徒对百姓说话的时候、祭司们和守殿官、并撒都该人、忽然来了。  
4:2 因他们教训百姓、本着耶稣、传说死人复活、就很烦恼。  
4:3 于是下手拿住他们。因为天已经晚了、就把他们押到第二天。  
4:4 但听道之人、有许多信的、男丁数目、约到五千。  
4:5 第二天、官府、长老、和文士、在耶路撒冷聚会。  

4:6 又有大祭司亚那、和该亚法、约翰、亚力山大、并大祭司的亲族都在那里。  
4:7 叫使徒站在当中、就问他们说、你们用甚么能力、奉谁的名、作这事呢。  
4:8 那时、彼得被圣灵充满、对他们说、  
4:9 治民的官府、和长老阿、倘若今日、因为在残疾人身上所行的善事、查问我们他是怎么得了痊癒。  
4:10 你们众人、和以色列百姓、都当知道、站在你们面前的这人得痊癒、是因你们所钉十字架、　神叫他从死里复活的、拿撒勒人耶稣基督的名。  

4:11 他是你们匠人所弃的石头、已成了房角的头块石头。  
4:12 除他以外、别无拯救。因为在天下人间、没有赐下别的名、我们可以靠着得救。  
4:13 他们见彼得约翰的胆量、又看出他们原是没有学问的小民、就希奇、认明他们是跟过耶稣的。  
4:14 又看见那治好了的人、和他们一同站着、就无话可驳。  
4:15 于是吩咐他们从公会出去、就彼此商议说、  

4:16 我们当怎样办这两个人呢、因为他们诚然行了一件明显的神迹、凡住耶路撒冷的人都知道、我们也不能说没有。  
4:17 惟恐这事越发传扬在民间、我们必须恐吓他们、叫他们不再奉这名对人讲论。  
4:18 于是叫了他们来、禁止他们、总不可奉耶稣的名讲论教训人。  
4:19 彼得约翰说、听从你们、不听从　神、这在　神面前合理不合理、你们自己酌量吧。  
4:20 我们所看见所听见的、不能不说。  

4:21 官长为百姓的缘故、想不出法子刑罚他们、又恐吓一番、把他们释放了。这是因众人为所行的奇事、都归荣耀与　神。  
4:22 原来借着神迹医好的那人、有四十多岁了。  
4:23 二人既被释放、就到会友那里去、把祭司长和长老所说的话、都告诉他们。  
4:24 他们听见了、就同心合意的、高声向　神说、主阿、你是造天、地、海、和其中万物的。  
4:25 你曾借着圣灵、托你仆人我们祖宗大卫的口、说、『外邦为甚么争闹、万民为甚么谋算虚妄的事。  

4:26 世上的君王一齐起来、臣宰也聚集、要敌挡主、并主的受膏者。〔或作基督〕』  
4:27 希律和本丢彼拉多、外邦人和以色列民、果然在这城里聚集、要攻打你所膏的圣仆耶稣、〔仆或作子〕
4:28 成就你手和你意旨所预定必有的事。  
4:29 他们恐吓我们、现在求主鉴察。一面叫你仆人大放胆量、讲你的道、一面伸出你的手来、医治疾病、并且使神迹奇事、因着你圣仆耶稣的名行出来。〔仆或作子〕
4:30 见上节

4:31 祷告完了、聚会的地方震动。他们就都被圣灵充满、放胆讲论　神的道。  
4:32 那许多信的人、都是一心一意的、没有一人说、他的东西有一样是自己的、都是大家公用。  
4:33 使徒大有能力、见证主耶稣复活。众人也都蒙大恩。  
4:34 内中也没有一个缺乏的、因为人人将田产房屋都卖了、把所卖的价银拿来、放在使徒脚前。  
4:35 照各人所需用的、分给各人。  

4:36 有一个利未人、生在居比路、名叫约瑟、使徒称他为巴拿巴。（巴拿巴翻出来、就是劝慰子)
4:37 他有田地、也卖了、把价银拿来、放在使徒脚前。
