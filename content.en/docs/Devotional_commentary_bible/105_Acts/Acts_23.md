23:1 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.  
23:2 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.  
23:3 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?  
23:4 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?  
23:5 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.  

23:6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.  
23:7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.  
23:8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.  
23:9 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.  
23:10 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.  

23:11 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.  
23:12 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.  
23:13 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.  
23:14 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.  
23:15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.  

23:16 And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.  
23:17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.  
23:18 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.  
23:19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?  
23:20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.  

23:21 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.  
23:22 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.  
23:23 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;  
23:24 And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.  
23:25 And he wrote a letter after this manner:  

23:26 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.  
23:27 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.  
23:28 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:  
23:29 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.  
23:30 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.  

23:31 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.  
23:32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:  
23:33 Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.  
23:34 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;  
23:35 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

23:1 保罗定睛看着公会的人、说、弟兄们、我在　神面前行事为人、都是凭着良心、直到今日。  
23:2 大祭司亚拿尼亚、就吩咐旁边站着的人打他的嘴。  
23:3 保罗对他说、你这粉饰的墙、　神要打你。你坐堂为的是按律法审问我、你竟违背律法、吩咐人打我么。  
23:4 站在旁边的人说、你辱骂　神的大祭司么。  
23:5 保罗说、弟兄们、我不晓得他是大祭司。经上记着说、『不可毁谤你百姓的官长。』  

23:6 保罗看出大众、一半是撒都该人、一半是法利赛人、就在公会中大声说、弟兄们、我是法利赛人、也是法利赛人的子孙。我现在受审问、是为盼望死人复活。  
23:7 说了这话、法利赛人和撒都该人、就争论起来、会众分为两党。  
23:8 因为撒都该人说、没有复活、也没有天使、和鬼魂。法利赛人却说、两样都有。  
23:9 于是大大的喧嚷起来。有几个法利赛党的文士站起来、争辩说、我们看不出这人有甚么恶处、倘若有鬼魂、或是天使、对他说过话、怎么样呢。  
23:10 那时大起争吵、千夫长恐怕保罗被他们扯碎了、就吩咐兵丁下去、把他从众人当中抢出来、带进营楼去。  

23:11 当夜、主站在保罗旁边说、放心吧、你怎样在耶路撒冷为我作见证、也必怎样在罗马为我作见证。  
23:12 到了天亮、犹太人同谋起誓、说、若不先杀保罗、就不吃不喝。  
23:13 这样同心起誓的、有四十多人。  
23:14 他们来见祭司长和长老说、我们已经起了一个大誓、若不先杀保罗、就不吃甚么。  
23:15 现在你们和公会要知会千夫长、叫他带下保罗到你们这里来、假作要详细察考他的事。我们已经预备好了、不等他来到跟前就杀他。  

23:16 保罗的外甥、听见他们设下埋伏、就来到营楼里告诉保罗。  
23:17 保罗请一个百夫长来、说、你领这少年人去见千夫长、他有事告诉他。  
23:18 于是把他领去见千夫长说、被囚的保罗请我到他那里、求我领这少年人来见你。他有事告诉你。  
23:19 千夫长就拉着他的手、走到一旁、私下问他说、你有甚么事告诉我呢。  
23:20 他说、犹太人已经约定、要求你明天带下保罗到公会里去、假作要详细查问他的事。  

23:21 你切不要随从他们、因为他们有四十多人埋伏、已经起誓、说、若不先杀保罗、就不吃不喝。现在预备好了、只等你应允。  
23:22 于是千夫长打发少年人走、嘱咐他说、不要告诉人你将这事报给我了。  
23:23 千夫长便叫了两个百夫长来、说、预备步兵二百、马兵七十、长枪手二百、今夜亥初往该撒利亚去。  
23:24 也要预备牲口叫保罗骑上、护送到巡抚腓力斯那里去。  
23:25 千夫长又写了文书、  

23:26 大略说、革老丢吕西亚、请巡抚腓力斯大人安。  
23:27 这人被犹太人拿住、将要杀害、我得知他是罗马人、就带兵丁下去救他出来。  
23:28 因要知道他们告他的缘故、我就带他下到他们的公会去。  
23:29 便查知他被告、是因他们律法的辩论、并没有甚么该死该绑的罪名。  
23:30 后来有人把要害他的计谋告诉我、我就立时解他到你那里去、又吩咐告他的人、在你面前告他。〔有古卷在此有愿你平安〕

23:31 于是兵丁照所吩咐他们的、将保罗夜里带到安提帕底。  
23:32 第二天、让马兵护送、他们就回营楼去。  
23:33 马兵来到该撒利亚、把文书呈给巡抚、便叫保罗站在他面前。  
23:34 巡抚看了文书、问保罗是那省的人、既晓得他是基利家人、  
23:35 就说、等告你的人来到、我要细听你的事、便吩咐人把他看守在希律的衙门里。
