22:1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.  
22:2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.  
22:3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.  
22:4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.  
22:5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.  

22:6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.  
22:7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.  
22:8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.  
22:9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
22:10 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.  

22:11 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
22:12 And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.  
22:13 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.  
22:14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.  
22:15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:  

22:16 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.  
22:17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:  
22:18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.  
22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.  
22:20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.  

22:21 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.  
22:22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
22:23 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.  
22:24 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.  
22:25 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.  

22:26 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.  
22:27 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.  
22:28 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.  
22:29 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;  
22:30 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  

22:31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:  
22:32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.  
22:33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.  
22:34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.  
22:35 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.  

22:36 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.  
22:37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.  
22:38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.  
22:39 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.  
22:40 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.  

22:41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,  
22:42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.  
22:43 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.  
22:44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.  
22:45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,  

22:46 And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.  
22:47 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.  
22:48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
22:49 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
22:50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.  

22:51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.  
22:52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?
22:53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.  
22:54 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.  
22:55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.  

22:56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.  
22:57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.  
22:58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.  
22:59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.  
22:60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.  

22:61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  
22:62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.  
22:63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.  
22:64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
22:65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.  

22:66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,  
22:67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:  
22:68 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.  
22:69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.  
22:70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.  

22:71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.

22:1 除酵节、又名逾越节、近了。  
22:2 祭司长和文士、想法子怎么才能杀害耶稣。是因他们惧怕百姓。  
22:3 这时、撒但入了那称为加略人犹大的心、他本是十二门徒里的一个。  
22:4 他去和祭司长并守殿官商量、怎么可以把耶稣交给他们。  
22:5 他们欢喜、就约定给他银子。  

22:6 他应允了、就找机会要趁众人不在跟前的时候、把耶稣交给他们。  
22:7 除酵节、须宰逾越羊羔的那一天到了。  
22:8 耶稣打发彼得、约翰、说、你们去为我们预备逾越节的筵席、好叫我们吃。  
22:9 他们问他说、要我们在那里预备。  
22:10 耶稣说、你们进了城、必有人拿着一瓶水迎面而来。你们就跟着他、到他所进的房子里去。  

22:11 对那家的主人说、夫子说、客房在那里、我与门徒好在那里吃逾越节的筵席。  
22:12 他必指给你们摆设整齐的一间大楼、你们就在那里预备。  
22:13 他们去了、所遇见的、正如耶稣所说的。他们就预备了逾越节的筵席。  
22:14 时候到了、耶稣坐席、使徒也和他同坐。  
22:15 耶稣对他们说、我很愿意在受害以先、和你们吃这逾越节的筵席。  

22:16 我告诉你们、我不再吃这筵席、直到成就在　神的国里。  
22:17 耶稣接过杯来、祝谢了、说、你们拿这个、大家分着喝。  
22:18 我告诉你们、从今以后、我不再喝这葡萄汁、直等　神的国来到。  
22:19 又拿起饼来祝谢了、就擘开递给他们、说、这是我的身体、为你们舍的。你们也应当如此行、为的是记念我。  
22:20 饭后也照样拿起杯来、说、这杯是用我血所立的新约、是为你们流出来的。  

22:21 看哪、那卖我之人的手、与我一同在桌子上。  
22:22 人子固然要照所预定的去世。但卖人子的人有祸了。  
22:23 他们就彼此对问、是那一个要作这事。  
22:24 门徒起了争论、他们中间那一个可算为大。  
22:25 耶稣说、外邦人有君王为主治理他们。那掌权管他们的称为恩主。  

22:26 但你们不可这样。你们里头为大的、倒要像年幼的。为首领的、倒要像服事人的。  
22:27 是谁为大、是坐席的呢、是服事人的呢。不是坐席的大么。然而我在你们中间、如同服事人的。  
22:28 我在磨炼之中、常和我同在的就是你们。  
22:29 我将国赐给你们、正如我父赐给我一样。  
22:30 叫你们在我国里、坐在我的席上吃喝。并且坐在宝座上、审判以色列十二个支派。  

22:31 主又说、西门、西门、撒但想要得着你们、好筛你们、像筛麦子一样。  
22:32 但我已经为你祈求、叫你不至于失了信心。你回头以后、要坚固你的弟兄。  
22:33 彼得说、主阿。我就是同你下监、同你受死、也是甘心。  
22:34 耶稣说、彼得、我告诉你、今日鸡还没有叫、你要三次说不认得我。  
22:35 耶稣又对他们说、我差你们出去的时候、没有钱囊、没有口袋、没有鞋、你们缺少甚么没有。他们说、没有。  

22:36 耶稣说、但如今有钱囊的可以带着、有口袋的也可以带着。没有刀的要卖衣服买刀。  
22:37 我告诉你们、经上写着说、『他被列在罪犯之中。』这话必应验在我身上、因为那关系我的事、必然成就。  
22:38 他们说、主阿、请看、这里有两把刀。耶稣说、够了。  
22:39 耶稣出来、照常往橄榄山去。门徒也跟随他。  
22:40 到了那地方、就对他们说、你们要祷告、免得入了迷惑。  

22:41 于是离开他们、约有扔一块石头那么远、跪下祷告、
22:42 说、父阿、你若愿意、就把这杯撤去。然而不要成就我的意思、只要成就你的意思。  
22:43 有一位天使从天上显现、加添他的力量。  
22:44 耶稣极其伤痛、祷告更加恳切。汗珠如大血点、滴在地上。  
22:45 祷告完了、就起来、到门徒那里、见他们因为忧愁都睡着了。  

22:46 就对他们说、你们为甚么睡觉呢。起来祷告、免得入了迷惑。  
22:47 说话之间来了许多人、那十二个门徒里名叫犹大的、走在前头、就近耶稣、要与他亲嘴。  
22:48 耶稣对他说、犹大、你用亲嘴的暗号卖人子么。  
22:49 左右的人见光景不好、就说、主阿、我们拿刀砍可以不可以。  
22:50 内中有一个人、把大祭司的仆人砍了一刀、削掉了他的右耳。  

22:51 耶稣说、到了这个地步、由他们吧。就摸那人的耳朵、把他治好了。  
22:52 耶稣对那些来拿他的祭司长、和守殿官、并长老、说、你们带着刀棒、出来拿我、如同拿强盗么。  
22:53 我天天同你们在殿里、你们不下手拿我。现在却是你们的时候、黑暗掌权了。  
22:54 他们拿住耶稣、把他带到大祭司的宅里。彼得远远的跟着。  
22:55 他们在院子里生了火、一同坐着。彼得也坐在他们中间。  

22:56 有一个使女、看见彼得坐在火光里、就定睛看他、说、这个人素来也是同那人一伙的。  
22:57 彼得却不承认、说、女子、我不认得他。  
22:58 过了不多的时候、又有一个人看见他、说、你也是他们一党的。彼得说、你这个人、我不是。  
22:59 约过了一小时、又有一个人极力的说、他实在是同那人一伙的。因为他也是加利利人。  
22:60 彼得说、你这个人、我不晓得你说的是甚么。正说话之间、鸡就叫了。  

22:61 主转过身来、看彼得。彼得便想起主对他所说的话、今日鸡叫以先、你要三次不认我。  
22:62 他就出去痛哭。  
22:63 看守耶稣的人戏弄他、打他、
22:64 又蒙着他的眼问他说、你是先知、告诉我们、打你的是谁。  
22:65 他们还用许多别的话辱骂他。  

22:66 天一亮、民间的众长老连祭司长带文士都聚会。把耶稣带到他们的公会里、
22:67 说、你若是基督、就告诉我们。耶稣说、我若告诉你们、你们也不信。  
22:68 我若问你们、你们也不回答。  
22:69 从今以后、人子要坐在　神权能的右边。  
22:70 他们都说、这样、你是　神的儿子么。耶稣说、你们所说的是。  

22:71 他们说、何必再用见证呢。他亲口所说的、我们都亲自听见了。
