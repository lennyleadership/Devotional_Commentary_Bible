23:1 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.  
23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.  
23:3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.  
23:4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.  
23:5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.  

23:6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.  
23:7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.  
23:8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.  
23:9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.  
23:10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.  

23:11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.  
23:12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.  
23:13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,  
23:14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:  
23:15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.  

23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.  
23:17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
23:18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:  
23:19 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
23:20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.  

23:21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.  
23:22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.  
23:23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.  
23:24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.  
23:25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.  

23:26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.  
23:27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.  
23:28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.  
23:29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.  
23:30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.  

23:31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
23:32 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.  
23:33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.  
23:34 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.  
23:35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.  

23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,  
23:37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.  
23:38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  
23:39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.  
23:40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

23:41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.  
23:42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.  
23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.  
23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.  
23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.  

23:46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.  
23:47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. <a class = "marginnote">[2023.02.22 LBC]v47 glorified: it is translated as worshiped in NLT.<br> Worship: show adoration, deity, reverent to God. <br> to agree with who he is, to acknowledge who he is, and repent.</a>  
23:48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.  
23:49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.  
23:50 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:  

23:51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.  
23:52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.  
23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.  
23:54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.  
23:55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.  

23:56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.

23:1 众人都起来、把耶稣解到彼拉多面前。  
23:2 就告他说、我们见这人诱惑国民、禁止纳税给该撒、并说自己是基督、是王。  
23:3 彼拉多问耶稣说、你是犹太人的王么。耶稣回答说、你说的是。  
23:4 彼拉多对祭司长和众人说、我查不出这人有甚么罪来。  
23:5 但他们越发极力的说、他煽惑百姓、在犹太遍地传道、从加利利起、直到这里了。  

23:6 彼拉多一听见、就问这人是加利利人么。  
23:7 既晓得耶稣属希律所管、就把他送到希律那里去。那时希律正在耶路撒冷。  
23:8 希律看见耶稣、就很欢喜。因为听见过他的事、久已想要见他。并且指望看他行一件神迹。  
23:9 于是问他许多的话。耶稣却一言不答。  
23:10 祭司长和文士、都站着极力的告他。  

23:11 希律和他的兵丁就藐视耶稣、戏弄他、给他穿上华丽衣服、把他送回彼拉多那里去。  
23:12 从前希律和彼拉多彼此有仇。在那一天就成了朋友。  
23:13 彼拉多传齐了祭司长、和、官府并百姓、
23:14 就对他们说、你们解这人到我这里、说他是诱惑百姓的。看哪、我也曾将你们告他的事、在你们面前审问他、并没有查出他甚么罪来。  
23:15 就是希律也是如此、所以把他送回来。可见他没有作甚么该死的事。  

23:16 故此我要责打他、把他释放了。〔有古卷在此有〕
23:17 〔每逢这节期巡抚必须释放一个囚犯给他们〕
23:18 众人却一齐喊着说、除掉这个人、释放巴拉巴给我们。  
23:19 这巴拉巴是因在城里作乱杀人下在监里的。  
23:20 彼拉多愿意释放耶稣、就又劝解他们。  

23:21 无奈他们喊着说、钉他十字架、钉他十字架。  
23:22 彼拉多第三次对他们说、为甚么呢、这人作了甚么恶事呢、我并没有查出他甚么该死的罪来。所以我要责打他、把他释放了。  
23:23 他们大声催逼彼拉多、求他把耶稣钉在十字架上。他们的声音就得了胜、
23:24 彼拉多这才照他们所求的定案。  
23:25 把他们所求的那作乱杀人下在监里的、释放了。把耶稣交给他们、任凭他们的意思行。  

23:26 带耶稣去的时候、有一个古利奈人西门、从乡下来。他们就抓住他、把十字架搁在他身上、叫他背着跟随耶稣。  
23:27 有许多百姓、跟随耶稣、内中有好些妇女、妇女们为他号咷痛哭。  
23:28 耶稣转身对他们说、耶路撒冷的女子、不要为我哭、当为自己和自己的儿女哭。  
23:29 因为日子要到、人必说、不生育的、和未曾怀胎的、未曾乳养婴孩的、有福了。  
23:30 那时、人要向大山说、倒在我们身上。向小山说、遮盖我们。  

23:31 这些事既行在有汁水的树上、那枯干的树、将来怎么样呢。  
23:32 又有两个犯人、和耶稣一同带来处死。  
23:33 到了一个地方、名叫髑髅地、就在那里把耶稣钉在十字架上、又钉了两个犯人、一个在左边、一个在右边。  
23:34 当下耶稣说、父阿、赦免他们。因为他们所作的、他们不晓得。兵丁就拈阄分他的衣服。  
23:35 百姓站在那里观看。官府也嗤笑他说、他救了别人。他若是基督、　神所拣选的、可以救自己吧。  

23:36 兵丁也戏弄他、上前拿醋送给他喝、
23:37 说、你若是犹太人的王、可以救自己吧。  
23:38 在耶稣以上有一个牌子、〔有古卷在此有用希利尼罗马希伯来的文字〕写着、这是犹太人的王。  
23:39 那同钉的两个犯人、有一个讥诮他说、你不是基督么。可以救自己和我们吧。  
23:40 那一个就应声责备他说、你既是一样受刑的、还不怕　神么。  

23:41 我们是应该的。因我们所受的、与我们所作的相称。但这个人没有作过一件不好的事。  
23:42 就说、耶稣阿、你得国降临的时候、求你记念我。  
23:43 耶稣对他说、我实在告诉你、今日你要同我在乐园里了。  
23:44 那时约有午正、遍地都黑暗了、直到申初、
23:45 日头变黑了。殿里的幔子从当中裂为两半。  

23:46 耶稣大声喊着说、父阿、我将我的灵魂交在你手里。说了这话、气就断了。  
23:47 百夫长看见所成的事、就归荣耀与　神说、这真是个义人。  
23:48 聚集观看的众人、见了这所成的事、都捶着胸回去了。  
23:49 还有一切与耶稣熟识的人、和从加利利跟着他来的妇女们、都远远的站着、看这些事。  
23:50 有一个人名叫约瑟、是个议士、为人善良公义。  

23:51 众人所谋所为、他并没有附从。他本是犹太亚利马太城里素常盼望　神国的人。  
23:52 这人去见彼拉多、求耶稣的身体。  
23:53 就取下来用细麻布裹好、安放在石头凿成的坟墓里、那里头从来没有葬过人。  
23:54 那日是预备日、安息日也快到了。  
23:55 那些从加利利和耶稣同来的妇女、跟在后面、看见了坟墓、和他的身体怎样安放。  

23:56 他们就回去、预备了香料香膏。他们在安息日、便遵着诫命安息了。
