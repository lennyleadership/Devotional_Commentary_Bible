10:1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;  
10:2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;  
10:3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;  
10:4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. <a class ="marginnote">the spiritual rock</a>  
10:5 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.  

10:6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.  
10:7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.  
10:8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.  
10:9 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.  
10:10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.  

10:11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.  
10:12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.  
10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.  
10:14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.  
10:15 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.  

10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  
10:17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.  
10:18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?  
10:19 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?  
10:20 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.  

10:21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.  
10:22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?  
10:23 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.  
10:24 Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.  
10:25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:  

10:26 For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.  
10:27 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.  
10:28 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:  
10:29 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?  
10:30 For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?  

10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.    
10:32 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:  
10:33 Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

10:1 弟兄们、我不愿意你们不晓得、我们的祖宗从前都在云下、都从海中经过。  
10:2 都在云里海里受洗归了摩西。  
10:3 并且都吃了一样的灵食。  
10:4 也都喝了一样的灵水。所喝的是出于随着他们的灵磐石。那磐石就是基督。<a class ="marginnote">那作为基督表号的盘石已经被击打一次，表明基督必须一次被献。第二次，只需向磐石说话，正如我们现今只需奉耶稣的名祈求恩典一样。由于摩西第二次又击打磐石，这预表基督的美妙灵意就被破坏了。</a>  
10:5 但他们中间、多半是　神不喜欢的人。所以在旷野倒毙。  

10:6 这些事都是我们的鉴戒、叫我们不要贪恋恶事、像他们那样贪恋的。  
10:7 也不要拜偶像、像他们有人拜的。如经上所记、『百姓坐下吃喝、起来玩耍。』  
10:8 我们也不要行奸淫、像他们有人行的、一天就倒毙了二万三千人。  
10:9 也不要试探主、〔主有古卷作基督〕像他们有人试探的、就被蛇所灭。  
10:10 你们也不要发怨言、像他们有发怨言的、就被灭命的所灭。  

10:11 他们遭遇这些事、都要作为鉴戒。并且写在经上、正是警戒我们这末世的人。  
10:12 所以自己以为站得稳的、须要谨慎、免得跌倒。  
10:13 你们所遇见的试探、无非是人所能受的、　神是信实的、必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的。在受试探的时候、总要给你们开一条出路、叫你们能忍受得住。  
10:14 我所亲爱的弟兄阿、你们要逃避拜偶像的事。  
10:15 我好像对明白人说的、你们要审察我的话。  

10:16 我们所祝福的杯、岂不是同领基督的血么。我们所擘开的饼、岂不是同领基督的身体么。  
10:17 我们虽多、仍是一个饼、一个身体。因为我们都是分受这一个饼。  
10:18 你们看属肉体的以色列人。那吃祭物的、岂不是在祭坛上有分么。  
10:19 我是怎么说呢。岂是说祭偶像之物算得甚么呢。或说偶像算得甚么呢。  
10:20 我乃是说、外邦人所献的祭、是祭鬼、不是祭　神。我不愿意你们与鬼相交。  

10:21 你们不能喝主的杯、又喝鬼的杯。不能吃主的筵席、又吃鬼的筵席。  
10:22 我们可惹主的愤恨么。我们比他还有能力么。  
10:23 凡事都可行。但不都有益处。凡事都可行。但不都造就人。  
10:24 无论何人、不要求自己的益处、乃要求别人的益处。  
10:25 凡市上所卖的、你们只管吃、不要为良心的缘故问甚么话。  

10:26 因为地和其中所充满的、都属乎主。  
10:27 倘有一个不信的人请你们赴席、你们若愿意去、凡摆在你们面前的、只管吃、不要为良心的缘故问甚么话。  
10:28 若有人对你们说、这是献过祭的物、就要为那告诉你们的人、并为良心的缘故、不吃。  
10:29 我说的良心、不是你的、乃是他的。我这自由、为甚么被别人的良心论断呢。  
10:30 我若谢恩而吃、为甚么因我谢恩的物被人毁谤呢。  

10:31 所以你们或吃或喝、无论作甚么、都要为荣耀　神而行。  
10:32 不拘是犹太人、是希利尼人、是　神的教会、你们都不要使他跌倒。  
10:33 就好像我凡事都叫众人喜欢、不求自己的益处、只求众人的益处、叫他们得救。

  <h2>Still Human</h2>
  By Oswald Chambers   

>*…whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. — 1 Corinthians 10:31*  

In the Scriptures, the great miracle of the incarnation slips into the ordinary life of a child; the great miracle of the transfiguration fades into the demon-possessed valley below; the glory of the resurrection descends into a breakfast on the seashore. This is not an anticlimax, but a great revelation of God.  

We have a tendency to look for wonder in our experience, and <u class = "red">we mistake heroic actions for real heroes</u>. It’s one thing to go through a crisis grandly, yet quite another to go through every day glorifying God when there is no witness, no limelight, and no one paying even the remotest attention to us. If we are not looking for halos, we at least want something that will make people say, “What a wonderful man of prayer he is!” or, “What a great woman of devotion she is!” If you are properly devoted to the Lord Jesus, you have reached the lofty height where no one would ever notice you personally. All that is noticed is the power of God coming through you all the time.  

We want to be able to say, “Oh, I have had a wonderful call from God!” But to do even the most humbling tasks to the glory of God takes the Almighty God Incarnate working in us. To be utterly unnoticeable requires God’s Spirit in us making us absolutely humanly His. The true test of a saint’s life is not successfulness but faithfulness on the human level of life. We tend to set up success in Christian work as our purpose, but our purpose should be to display the glory of God in human life, to live a life “hidden with Christ in God” in our everyday human conditions (Colossians 3:3). Our human relationships are the very conditions in which the ideal life of God should be exhibited.

<h2>仍然是人</h2>  

无论作什么，都要为荣耀神而行。（林前十31）  

道成肉身的超其，湮没在平凡的童年生活；登山变象的辉煌光彩，消失在鬼附的山谷间；复活的荣耀，降卑成为海旁早餐。这不是反高潮，而是神极大的启示。  

我们总有一种倾向，就是想去追求超奇的经历；错把英雄感当作英雄。在重大关头昂然度过是一回事，在每天生活中荣耀神，没有人作证，没有光彩，丝毫没有被注意，又是另一回事。我们有时虽然不求中世纪那种圣人的光环，也想做些事令人家说：[看他是个多么会祈祷的人！]或[她多虔诚，多热心！]可是，若你对主耶稣有正确的献上，人所注意的是神透过你流露出来的大能。  

[噢，我从神得到一个奇妙的呼召！]其实要在最卑微的生活上荣耀神，正需要那全能的神在我们里面，才可以做得到。惟有圣灵在我们里面，才能使我们完全地属于他，以致全不为人所注意。圣徒生命的考验不在于成功，而是对实际生活的忠心。我们会以在基督教事工上的成功作目标，可是正确的目标，乃是在生活上彰显神的荣耀，在属世的环境下，活出与基督一同藏在神里面的生命。属神的理想生命，是在人与人之间的实际关系上表现出来。  

祈祷◆主啊，在今天的读经中，以下这句话使我的心灵震荡－－[摩西这样行，耶和华怎样吩咐他，他就照样行了。]

<h2>Brother LL Thoughts</h2>

[2022.11.27]  

中国有一句智慧的话，勿以善小而不为，勿以恶小而为之。  

我常常不在乎对待家人的态度，在言语上表现不恭。养成了下意识的动作。
