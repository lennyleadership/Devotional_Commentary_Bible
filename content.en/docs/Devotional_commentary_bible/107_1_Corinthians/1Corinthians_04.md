4:1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.  
4:2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.  
4:3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.  
4:4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.  
4:5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.  

4:6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.  
4:7 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?  
4:8 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.  
4:9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.  
4:10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.  

4:11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace:  
4:12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:  
4:13 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.  
4:14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.  
4:15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.  

4:16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.  
4:17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.  
4:18 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.  
4:19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.  
4:20 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.  

4:21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?

4:1 人应当以我们为基督的执事、为　神奥秘事的管家。<a id="1_ref" href = "#1">[1]</a>  
4:2 所求于管家的、是要他有忠心。  
4:3 我被你们论断、或被别人论断、我都以为极小的事。连我自己也不论断自己。  
4:4 我虽不觉得自己有错、却也不能因此得以称义。但判断我的乃是主。  
4:5 所以时候未到、甚么都不要论断、只等主来、他要照出暗中的隐情、显明人心的意念。那时各人要从　神那里得着称赞。  

4:6 弟兄们、我为你们的缘故、拿这些事转比自己和亚波罗。叫你们效法我们不可过于圣经所记。免得你们自高自大、贵重这个、轻看那个。  
4:7 使你与人不同的是谁呢。你有甚么不是领受的呢。若是领受的、为何自夸、彷彿不是领受的呢。  
4:8 你们已经饱足了、已经丰富了、不用我们、自己就作王了。我愿意你们果真作王、叫我们也得与你们一同作王。  
4:9 我想　神把我们使徒明明列在末后、好像定死罪的囚犯。因为我们成了一台戏、给世人和天使观看。  
4:10 我们为基督的缘故算是愚拙的、你们在基督里倒是聪明的、我们软弱、你们倒强壮。你们有荣耀、我们倒被藐视。  

4:11 直到如今、我们还是又饥、又渴、又赤身露体、又挨打、又没有一定的住处。  
4:12 并且劳苦、亲手作工。被人咒骂、我们就祝福。被人逼迫、我们就忍受。  
4:13 被人毁谤、我们就善劝。直到如今、人还把我们看作世界上的污秽、万物中的渣滓。  
4:14 我写这话、不是叫你们羞愧、乃是警戒你们、好像我所亲爱的儿女一样。  
4:15 你们学基督的、师傅虽有一万、为父的却是不多、因我在基督耶稣里用福音生了你们。  

4:16 所以我求你们效法我。  
4:17 因此我已打发提摩太到你们那里去。他在主里面、是我所亲爱有忠心的儿子。他必提醒你们、记念我在基督里怎样行事、在各处各教会中怎样教导人。  
4:18 有些人自高自大、以为我不到你们那里去。  
4:19 然而主若许我、我必快到你们那里去。并且我所要知道的、不是那些自高自大之人的言语、乃是他们的权能。  
4:20 因为　神的国不在乎言语、乃在乎权能。  

4:21 你们愿意怎么样呢。是愿意我带着刑杖到你们那里去呢、还是要我存慈爱温柔的心呢。  

<p id="1">[1] 奴仆的角色很多。有一类奴仆是指在船甲板下面划船的奴隶。他们出卖体力，不见天日，没有人权。

保罗称自己是基督的执事 (哥林多前书四章一节)，“执事”原文意思就是这类在船舱下的奴隶。他虽在生命中很成熟，配得上信徒的尊重，但却自称是耶稣的奴隶。因为耶稣是一位好主人，做祂的奴隶可以“头脑简单、不需要动脑筋”，耶稣叫他做什么，他就做什么。
