20:1 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.  
20:2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.  
20:3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!
20:4 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?  
20:5 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.  

20:6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.  
20:7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
20:8 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.  
20:9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.  
20:10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?  

20:11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also. <a class ="marginnote">Second time of smiting the rock.  The place is called Zin.</a>  
20:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.  
20:13 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.  
20:14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:  
20:15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:  

20:16 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:  
20:17 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.  
20:18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.  
20:19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.  
20:20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.  

20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.  
20:22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.  
20:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,  
20:24 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.  
20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:  

20:26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.  
20:27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.  
20:28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.  
20:29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

20:1 正月间以色列全会众、到了寻的旷野、就住在加低斯、米利暗死在那里、就葬在那里。  
20:2 会众没有水喝、就聚集攻击摩西、亚伦。  
20:3 百姓向摩西争闹说、我们的弟兄曾死在耶和华面前、我们恨不得与他们同死。  
20:4 你们为何把耶和华的会众领到这旷野、使我们和牲畜都死在这里呢。  
20:5 你们为何逼着我们出埃及、领我们到这坏地方呢。这地方不好撒种、也没有无花果树、葡萄树、石榴树、又没有水喝。  

20:6 摩西、亚伦离开会众、到会幕门口、俯伏在地。耶和华的荣光向他们显现。  
20:7 耶和华晓谕摩西说、  
20:8 你拿着杖去、和你的哥哥亚伦招聚会众、在他们眼前吩咐磐石发出水来、水就从磐石流出给会众、和他们的牲畜喝。  
20:9 于是摩西照耶和华所吩咐的、从耶和华面前取了杖去。  
20:10 摩西、亚伦就招聚会众到磐石前、摩西说、你们这些背叛的人听我说、我为你们使水从这磐石中流出来么。  

20:11 摩西举手、用杖击打磐石两下、就有许多水流出来、会众和他们的牲畜都喝了。  
20:12 耶和华对摩西、亚伦说、因为你们不信我、不在以色列人眼前尊我为圣、所以你们必不得领这会众进我所赐给他们的地去。  
20:13 这水名叫米利巴水〔米利巴就是争闹的意思〕、是因以色列人向耶和华争闹、耶和华就在他们面前显为圣。  
20:14 摩西从加低斯差遣使者去见以东王、说、你的弟兄以色列人这样说、我们所遭遇的一切艰难、  
20:15 就是我们的列祖下到埃及、我们在埃及久住、埃及人恶待我们的列祖、和我们、  

20:16 我们哀求耶和华的时候、他听了我们的声音、差遣使者把我们从埃及领出来、这事你都知道。如今、我们在你边界上的城加低斯。  
20:17 求你容我们从你的地经过、我们不走田间和葡萄园、也不喝井里的水、只走大道〔原文作王道〕、不偏左右、直到过了你的境界。  
20:18 以东王说、你不可从我的地经过、免得我带刀出去攻击你。  
20:19 以色列人说、我们要走大道上去、我们和牲畜若喝你的水、必给你价值、不求别的、只求你容我们步行过去。  
20:20 以东王说、你们不可经过。就率领许多人出来、要用强硬的手攻击以色列人。  

20:21 这样、以东王不肯容以色列人从他的境界过去。于是他们转去离开他。  
20:22 以色列全会众从加低斯起行、到了何珥山。  
20:23 耶和华在附近以东边界的何珥山上、晓谕摩西、亚伦说、  
20:24 亚伦要归到他列祖〔原文作本民〕那里、他必不得入我所赐给以色列人的地、因为在米利巴水你们违背了我的命。  
20:25 你带亚伦、和他的儿子以利亚撒上何珥山。  

20:26 把亚伦的圣衣脱下来、给他的儿子以利亚撒穿上、亚伦必死在那里归他列祖。  
20:27 摩西就照耶和华所吩咐的行。三人当着会众的眼前上了何珥山。  
20:28 摩西把亚伦的圣衣脱下来、给他的儿子以利亚撒穿上。亚伦就死在山顶那里。于是摩西和以利亚撒下了山。  
20:29 全会众、就是以色列全家、见亚伦已经死了、便都为亚伦哀哭了三十天。
