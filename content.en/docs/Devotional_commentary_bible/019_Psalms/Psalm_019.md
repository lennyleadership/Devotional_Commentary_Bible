19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.  
19:2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.  
19:3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.  
19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,  
19:5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.  

19:6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.  
19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.  
19:8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.  
19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.  
19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.  

19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.  
19:12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from <b>secret faults</b>.  
19:13 Keep back thy servant also from <b>presumptuous sins</b><a id="1_ref" href = "#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.<label for="19:13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">shared on 2023-09-03 at the breaking of bread meeting</span>     
19:14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.   

<p id="1">[1] a portion of a poem:  
<br>I have sinned times without number,  
<br>and been guilty of pride and unbelief,  
<br>of failure to find thy mind in thy Word,  
<br>of neglect to seek thee in my daily life.

19:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕诸天述说　神的荣耀。穹苍传扬他的手段。  
19:2 这日到那日发出言语。这夜到那夜传出知识。  
19:3 无言无语、也无声音可听。  
19:4 它的量带通遍天下、它的言语传到地极。　神在其间为太阳安设帐幕。  
19:5 太阳如同新郎出洞房、又如勇士欢然奔路。  

19:6 它从天这边出来、绕到天那边。没有一物被隐藏不得它的热气。  
19:7 耶和华的律法全备、能苏醒人心。耶和华的法度确定、能使愚人有智慧。  
19:8 耶和华的训词正直、能快活人的心。耶和华的命令清洁、能明亮人的眼目。  
19:9 耶和华的道理洁净、存到永远。耶和华的典章真实、全然公义。  
19:10 都比金子可羡慕、且比极多的精金可羡慕。比蜜甘甜、且比蜂房下滴的蜜甘甜。  

19:11 况且你的仆人因此受警戒、守着这些便有大赏。  
19:12 谁能知道自己的错失呢。愿你赦免我隐而未现的过错。  
19:13 求你拦阻仆人、不犯任意妄为的罪。不容这罪辖制我。我便完全、免犯大罪。  
19:14 耶和华我的磐石、我的救赎主阿、愿我口中的言语、心里的意念、在你面前蒙悦纳。
