Psalms Chapter 1  
1:1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.  
1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.  
1:3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.  
1:4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.  
1:5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.  

1:6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

Psalms Chapter 2   
2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?  
2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,  
2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.  
2:4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.  
2:5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.  

2:6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.  
2:7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.  
2:8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.  
2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.  
2:10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.  

2:11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.  
2:12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.

Psalms Chapter 3   
3:1 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.  
3:2 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.  
3:3 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.  
3:4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.  
3:5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.  

3:6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.  
3:7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.  
3:8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 4   
4:1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.  
4:2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.  
4:3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.  
4:4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.  
4:5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.  

4:6 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.  
4:7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.  
4:8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 5   
5:1 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.  
5:2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.  
5:3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.  
5:4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.  
5:5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.  

5:6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.  
5:7 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.  
5:8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.  
5:9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.  
5:10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.  

5:11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.  
5:12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.

Psalms Chapter 6   
6:1 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.  
6:2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.  
6:3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?  
6:4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.  
6:5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?  

6:6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.  
6:7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.  
6:8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.  
6:9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.  
6:10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 7     
7:1 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:  
7:2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.  
7:3 O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;  
7:4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)  
7:5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.  

7:6 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.  
7:7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.  
7:8 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.  
7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.  
7:10 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.  

7:11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.  
7:12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.  
7:13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.  
7:14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.  
7:15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.  

7:16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.  
7:17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

Psalms Chapter 8   
8:1 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.  
8:2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.  
8:3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;  
8:4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?  
8:5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.  

8:6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:  
8:7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;  
8:8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.  
8:9 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 9    
9:1 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.  
9:2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.  
9:3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.  
9:4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.  
9:5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.  

9:6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.  
9:7 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.  
9:8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.  
9:9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.  
9:10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.  

9:11 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.  
9:12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.  
9:13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:  
9:14 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.  
9:15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.  

9:16 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.  
9:17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.  
9:18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.  
9:19 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.  
9:20 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 10     
10:1 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?  
10:2 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.  
10:3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.  
10:4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.  
10:5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.  

10:6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.  
10:7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.  
10:8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.  
10:9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.  
10:10 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.  

10:11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.  
10:12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.  
10:13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.  
10:14 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.  
10:15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.  

10:16 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.  
10:17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:  
10:18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 11  
11:1 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?  
11:2 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.  
11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?  
11:4 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.  
11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.  

11:6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.  
11:7 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 12   
12:1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.  
12:2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.  
12:3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:  
12:4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?  
12:5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.  

12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.  
12:7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.  
12:8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 13  
13:1 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?  
13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?  
13:3 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;  
13:4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.  
13:5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.  

13:6 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 14  
14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.  
14:2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.  
14:3 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  
14:4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.  
14:5 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.  

14:6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.  
14:7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 15   
15:1 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?  
15:2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.  
15:3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.  
15:4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.  
15:5 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 16  
16:1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.  
16:2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;  
16:3 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.  
16:4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.  
16:5 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.  

16:6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.  
16:7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.  
16:8 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.  
16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.  
16:10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  

16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 17    
17:1 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.  
17:2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.  
17:3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.  
17:4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.  
17:5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.  

17:6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.  
17:7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.  
17:8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,  
17:9 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.  
17:10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.  

17:11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;  
17:12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.  
17:13 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:  
17:14 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.  
17:15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 18      
18:1 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.  
18:2 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.  
18:3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.  
18:4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.  
18:5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.  

18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.  
18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.  
18:8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  
18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.  
18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.  

18:11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.  
18:12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.  
18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.  
18:14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.  
18:15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.  

18:16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.  
18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.  
18:18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.  
18:19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.  
18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.  

18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.  
18:22 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.  
18:23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.  
18:24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.  
18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;  

18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.  
18:27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.  
18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.  
18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.  
18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.  

18:31 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?  
18:32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.  
18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.  
18:34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.  
18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.  

18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.  
18:37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.  
18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.  
18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.  
18:40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.  

18:41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  
18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.  
18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.  
18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.  
18:45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.  

18:46 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.  
18:47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.  
18:48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.  
18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.  
18:50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

Psalms Chapter 19    
19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.  
19:2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.  
19:3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.  
19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,  
19:5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.  

19:6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.  
19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.  
19:8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.  
19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.  
19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.  

19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.  
19:12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.  
19:13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.  
19:14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 20   
20:1 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;  
20:2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;  
20:3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.  
20:4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.  
20:5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.  

20:6 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.  
20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.  
20:8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.  
20:9 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

Psalms Chapter 21   
21:1 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!  
21:2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.  
21:3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.  
21:4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.  
21:5 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.  

21:6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.  
21:7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.  
21:8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.  
21:9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.  
21:10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.  

21:11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.  
21:12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.  
21:13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.

Psalms Chapter 22        
22:1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?  
22:2 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.  
22:3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.  
22:4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.  
22:5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.  

22:6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.  
22:7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,  
22:8 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.  
22:9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.  
22:10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.  

22:11 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.  
22:12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.  
22:13 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.  
22:14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.  
22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.  

22:16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.  
22:17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.  
22:18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.  
22:19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.  
22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.  

22:21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.  
22:22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.  
22:23 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.  
22:24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.  
22:25 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.  

22:26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.  
22:27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.  
22:28 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.  
22:29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.  
22:30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.  

22:31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 23  
23:1 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
23:2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  
23:3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  
23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  
23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  

23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 24   
24:1 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.  
24:2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.  
24:3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?  
24:4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.  
24:5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.  

24:6 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.  
24:7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.  
24:8 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.  
24:9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.  
24:10 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.

Psalms Chapter 25  
25:1 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.  
25:2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.  
25:3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.  
25:4 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.  
25:5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.  

25:6 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.  
25:7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.  
25:8 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.  
25:9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.  
25:10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.  

25:11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.  
25:12 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.  
25:13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.  
25:14 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.  
25:15 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.  

25:16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.  
25:17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.  
25:18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.  
25:19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.  
25:20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.  

25:21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.  
25:22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 26   
26:1 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.  
26:2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.  
26:3 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.  
26:4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.  
26:5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.  

26:6 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:  
26:7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.  
26:8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.  
26:9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:  
26:10 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.  

26:11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.  
26:12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 27    
27:1 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?  
27:2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.  
27:3 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.  
27:4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.  
27:5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.  

27:6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.  
27:7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.  
27:8 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.  
27:9 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.  
27:10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.  

27:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.  
27:12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.  
27:13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.  
27:14 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 28   
28:1 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.  
28:2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.  
28:3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.  
28:4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.  
28:5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.  

28:6 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.  
28:7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.  
28:8 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.  
28:9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.

Psalms Chapter 29  
29:1 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength.  
29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.  
29:3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.  
29:4 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.  
29:5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.  

29:6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.  
29:7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.  
29:8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.  
29:9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.  
29:10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.  

29:11 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.

Psalms Chapter 30   
30:1 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.  
30:2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.  
30:3 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.  
30:4 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.  
30:5 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.  

30:6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.  
30:7 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.  
30:8 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.  
30:9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?  
30:10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.  

30:11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;  
30:12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

Psalms Chapter 31     
31:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.  
31:2 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.  
31:3 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.  
31:4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.  
31:5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.  

31:6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.  
31:7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;  
31:8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.  
31:9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.  
31:10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.  

31:11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.  
31:12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.  
31:13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.  
31:14 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.  
31:15 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.  

31:16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.  
31:17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.  
31:18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.  
31:19 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!  
31:20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.  

31:21 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.  
31:22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.  
31:23 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.  
31:24 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.

Psalms Chapter 32  <
32:1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.  
32:2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.  
32:3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.  
32:4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.  
32:5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.  

32:6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.  
32:7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.  
32:8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.  
32:9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.  
32:10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.  

32:11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 33    
33:1 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.  
33:2 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.  
33:3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.  
33:4 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.  
33:5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.  

33:6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.  
33:7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.  
33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.  
33:9 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.  
33:10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.  

33:11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.  
33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.  
33:13 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.  
33:14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.  
33:15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.  

33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.  
33:17 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.  
33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;  
33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.  
33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.  

33:21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.  
33:22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.

Psalms Chapter 34     
34:1 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.  
34:2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.  
34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.  
34:4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.  
34:5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.  

34:6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.  
34:7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.  
34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.  
34:9 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.  
34:10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.  

34:11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.  
34:12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?  
34:13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.  
34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.  
34:15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.  

34:16 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.  
34:17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.  
34:18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.  
34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.  
34:20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.  

34:21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.  
34:22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.

Psalms Chapter 35       
35:1 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.  
35:2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.  
35:3 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.  
35:4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.  
35:5 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.  

35:6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.  
35:7 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.  
35:8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.  
35:9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.  
35:10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?  

35:11 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.  
35:12 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.  
35:13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.  
35:14 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.  
35:15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:  

35:16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.  
35:17 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.  
35:18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.  
35:19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.  
35:20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.  

35:21 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.  
35:22 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.  
35:23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.  
35:24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.  
35:25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.  

35:26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.  
35:27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.  
35:28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.

Psalms Chapter 36   
36:1 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.  
36:2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.  
36:3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.  
36:4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.  
36:5 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.  

36:6 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.  
36:7 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.  
36:8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.  
36:9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.  
36:10 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.  

36:11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.  
36:12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.

Psalms Chapter 37          
37:1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.  
37:2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.  
37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.  
37:4 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.  
37:5 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.  

37:6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.  
37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.  
37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.  
37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.  
37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.  

37:11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.  
37:12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.  
37:13 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.  
37:14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.  
37:15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.  

37:16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.  
37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.  
37:18 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.  
37:19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.  
37:20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.  

37:21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.  
37:22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.  
37:23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.  
37:24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.  
37:25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.  

37:26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.  
37:27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.  
37:28 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.  
37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.  
37:30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.  

37:31 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.  
37:32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.  
37:33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.  
37:34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.  
37:35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.  

37:36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.  
37:37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.  
37:38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.  
37:39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.  
37:40 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.

Psalms Chapter 38     
38:1 O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.  
38:2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.  
38:3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.  
38:4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.  
38:5 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.  

38:6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.  
38:7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.  
38:8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.  
38:9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.  
38:10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.  

38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.  
38:12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.  
38:13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.  
38:14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.  
38:15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.  

38:16 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.  
38:17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.  
38:18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.  
38:19 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.  
38:20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.  

38:21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.  
38:22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 39    
39:1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.  
39:2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.  
39:3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,  
39:4 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.  
39:5 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.  

39:6 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.  
39:7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.  
39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.  
39:9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.  
39:10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.  

39:11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.  
39:12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.  
39:13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 40     
40:1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.  
40:2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.  
40:3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.  
40:4 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.  
40:5 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.  

40:6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.  
40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,  
40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.  
40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.  
40:10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.  

40:11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.  
40:12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.  
40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.  
40:14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.  
40:15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.  

40:16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.  
40:17 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 41    
41:1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.  
41:2 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.  
41:3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.  
41:4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.  
41:5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?  

41:6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.  
41:7 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.  
41:8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.  
41:9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.  
41:10 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.  

41:11 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.  
41:12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.  
41:13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

Psalms Chapter 42    
42:1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.  
42:2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?  
42:3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?  
42:4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.  
42:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.  

42:6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.  
42:7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.  
42:8 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.  
42:9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?  
42:10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?  

42:11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 43   
43:1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.  
43:2 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?  
43:3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.  
43:4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.  
43:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.

Psalms Chapter 44      
44:1 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.  
44:2 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.  
44:3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.  
44:4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.  
44:5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.  

44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.  
44:7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.  
44:8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.  
44:9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.  
44:10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.  

44:11 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.  
44:12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.  
44:13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.  
44:14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.  
44:15 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,  

44:16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.  
44:17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.  
44:18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;  
44:19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.  
44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;  

44:21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.  
44:22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.  
44:23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.  
44:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?  
44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.  

44:26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.

Psalms Chapter 45     
45:1 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.  
45:2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.  
45:3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.  
45:4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.  
45:5 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.  

45:6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.  
45:7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.  
45:8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.  
45:9 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.  
45:10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;  

45:11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.  
45:12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.  
45:13 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.  
45:14 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.  
45:15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.  

45:16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.  
45:17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

Psalms Chapter 46    
46:1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.  
46:2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;  
46:3 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.  
46:4 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.  
46:5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.  

46:6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.  
46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.  
46:8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.  
46:9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.  
46:10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.  

46:11 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

Psalms Chapter 47   
47:1 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.  
47:2 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.  
47:3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.  
47:4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.  
47:5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.  

47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.  
47:7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.  
47:8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.  
47:9 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.

Psalms Chapter 48    
48:1 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.  
48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.  
48:3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.  
48:4 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.  
48:5 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.  

48:6 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.  
48:7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.  
48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.  
48:9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.  
48:10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.  

48:11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.  
48:12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.  
48:13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.  
48:14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.

Psalms Chapter 49    
49:1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:  
49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.  
49:3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.  
49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.  
49:5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?  

49:6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;  
49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:  
49:8 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)  
49:9 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.  
49:10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.  

49:11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.  
49:12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.  
49:13 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.  
49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.  
49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.  

49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;  
49:17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.  
49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.  
49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.  
49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.

Psalms Chapter 50     
50:1 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.  
50:2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.  
50:3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.  
50:4 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.  
50:5 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.  

50:6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.  
50:7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.  
50:8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.  
50:9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.  
50:10 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.  

50:11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.  
50:12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.  
50:13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?  
50:14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:  
50:15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.  

50:16 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?  
50:17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee.  
50:18 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.  
50:19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.  
50:20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.  

50:21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.  
50:22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.  
50:23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

Psalms Chapter 51      
51:1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.  
51:2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.  
51:3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.  
51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.  
51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.  

51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.  
51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  
51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.  
51:9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.  
51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.  

51:11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.  
51:12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.  
51:13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.  
51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.  
51:15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.  

51:16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.  
51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.  
51:18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.  
51:19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

Psalms Chapter 52   
52:1 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually.  
52:2 Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.  
52:3 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.  
52:4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.  
52:5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.  

52:6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:  
52:7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.  
52:8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.  
52:9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 53  
53:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.  
53:2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.  
53:3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  
53:4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.  
53:5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.  

53:6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 54  
54:1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.  
54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.  
54:3 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.  
54:4 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.  
54:5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.  

54:6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.  
54:7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 55     
55:1 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.  
55:2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;  
55:3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.  
55:4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.  
55:5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.  

55:6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.  
55:7 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.  
55:8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.  
55:9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.  
55:10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.  

55:11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.  
55:12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:  
55:13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.  
55:14 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.  
55:15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.  

55:16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.  
55:17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.  
55:18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.  
55:19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.  
55:20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.  

55:21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.  
55:22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.  
55:23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 56    
56:1 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.  
56:2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.  
56:3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.  
56:4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.  
56:5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.  

56:6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.  
56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.  
56:8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?  
56:9 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.  
56:10 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.  

56:11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.  
56:12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.  
56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 57    
57:1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.  
57:2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.  
57:3 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.  
57:4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.  
57:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.  

57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.  
57:7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.  
57:8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.  
57:9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.  
57:10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.  

57:11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 58    
58:1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?  
58:2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.  
58:3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.  
58:4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;  
58:5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.  

58:6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.  
58:7 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.  
58:8 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.  
58:9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.  
58:10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.  

58:11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 59     
59:1 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.  
59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.  
59:3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.  
59:4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.  
59:5 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.  

59:6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.  
59:7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?  
59:8 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.  
59:9 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.  
59:10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.  

59:11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.  
59:12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.  
59:13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.  
59:14 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.  
59:15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.  

59:16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.  
59:17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.

Psalms Chapter 60   
60:1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.  
60:2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.  
60:3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.  
60:4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.  
60:5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.  

60:6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.  
60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;  
60:8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.  
60:9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?  
60:10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?  

60:11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.  
60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

Psalms Chapter 61   
61:1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.  
61:2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.  
61:3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.  
61:4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.  
61:5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.  

61:6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.  
61:7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.  
61:8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.

Psalms Chapter 62   
62:1 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.  
62:2 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.  
62:3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.  
62:4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.  
62:5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.  

62:6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.  
62:7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.  
62:8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.  
62:9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.  
62:10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.  

62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.  
62:12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.

Psalms Chapter 63    
63:1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;  
63:2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.  
63:3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.  
63:4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.  
63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:  

63:6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.  
63:7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.  
63:8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.  
63:9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.  
63:10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.  

63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.

Psalms Chapter 64   
64:1 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.  
64:2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:  
64:3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:  
64:4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.  
64:5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?  

64:6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.  
64:7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.  
64:8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.  
64:9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.  
64:10 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

Psalms Chapter 65    
65:1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.  
65:2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.  
65:3 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.  
65:4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.  
65:5 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:  

65:6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:  
65:7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.  
65:8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.  
65:9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.  
65:10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.  

65:11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.  
65:12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.  
65:13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

Psalms Chapter 66    
66:1 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:  
66:2 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.  
66:3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.  
66:4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah.  
66:5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.  

66:6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.  
66:7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.  
66:8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:  
66:9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.  
66:10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.  

66:11 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.  
66:12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.  
66:13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,  
66:14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.  
66:15 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.  

66:16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.  
66:17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.  
66:18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:  
66:19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.  
66:20 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.

67:3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.  
67:4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.  
67:5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.  

67:6 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.  
67:7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.

Psalms Chapter 68         
68:1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.  
68:2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.  
68:3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.  
68:4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.  
68:5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.  

68:6 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.  
68:7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:  
68:8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.  
68:9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.  
68:10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.  

68:11 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.  
68:12 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.  
68:13 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.  
68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.  
68:15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.  

68:16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.  
68:17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.  
68:18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.  
68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.  
68:20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.  

68:21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.  
68:22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:  
68:23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.  
68:24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.  
68:25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.  

68:26 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.  
68:27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.  
68:28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.  
68:29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.  
68:30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.  

68:31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.  
68:32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:  
68:33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.  
68:34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.  
68:35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.

Psalms Chapter 69          
69:1 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.  
69:2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.  
69:3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.  
69:4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.  
69:5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.  

69:6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.  
69:7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.  
69:8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.  
69:9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.  
69:10 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.  

69:11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.  
69:12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.  
69:13 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.  
69:14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.  
69:15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.  

69:16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.  
69:17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.  
69:18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.  
69:19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.  
69:20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.  

69:21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.  
69:22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.  
69:23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.  
69:24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.  
69:25 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.  

69:26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.  
69:27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.  
69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.  
69:29 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.  
69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.  

69:31 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.  
69:32 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.  
69:33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.  
69:34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.  
69:35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.  

69:36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

Psalms Chapter 70   
70:1 Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.  
70:2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.  
70:3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.  
70:4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.  
70:5 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 71     
71:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.  
71:2 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.  
71:3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.  
71:4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.  
71:5 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.  

71:6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.  
71:7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.  
71:8 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.  
71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.  
71:10 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,  

71:11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.  
71:12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.  
71:13 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.  
71:14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.  
71:15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.  

71:16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.  
71:17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.  
71:18 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.  
71:19 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!  
71:20 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.  

71:21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.  
71:22 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.  
71:23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.  
71:24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.

Psalms Chapter 72    
72:1 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.  
72:2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.  
72:3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.  
72:4 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.  
72:5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.  

72:6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.  
72:7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.  
72:8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.  
72:9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.  
72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.  

72:11 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.  
72:12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.  
72:13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.  
72:14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.  
72:15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.  

72:16 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.  
72:17 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.  
72:18 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.  
72:19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.  
72:20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

Psalms Chapter 73       
73:1 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.  
73:2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.  
73:3 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.  
73:4 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.  
73:5 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.  

73:6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.  
73:7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.  
73:8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.  
73:9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.  
73:10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.  

73:11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?  
73:12 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.  
73:13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.  
73:14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.  
73:15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.  

73:16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;  
73:17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.  
73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.  
73:19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.  
73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.  

73:21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.  
73:22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.  
73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.  
73:24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.  
73:25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.  

73:26 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.  
73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.  
73:28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 74     
74:1 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?  
74:2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.  
74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.  
74:4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.  
74:5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.  

74:6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.  
74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.  
74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.  
74:9 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.  
74:10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?  

74:11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.  
74:12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.  
74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.  
74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.  
74:15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.  

74:16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.  
74:17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.  
74:18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.  
74:19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.  
74:20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.  

74:21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.  
74:22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.  
74:23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 75   
75:1 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.  
75:2 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.  
75:3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.  
75:4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:  
75:5 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.  

75:6 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.  
75:7 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.  
75:8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.  
75:9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.  
75:10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 76   
76:1 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.  
76:2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.  
76:3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.  
76:4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.  
76:5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.  

76:6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.  
76:7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?  
76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,  
76:9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.  
76:10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.  

76:11 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.  
76:12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 77    
77:1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.  
77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.  
77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.  
77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.  
77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.  

77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.  
77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?  
77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?  
77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.  
77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.  

77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.  
77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.  
77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?  
77:14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.  
77:15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.  

77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.  
77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.  
77:18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.  
77:19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.  
77:20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 78            
78:1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.  
78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:  
78:3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.  
78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.  
78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:  

78:6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:  
78:7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:  
78:8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.  
78:9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.  
78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;  

78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.  
78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.  
78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.  
78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.  
78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.  

78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.  
78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.  
78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.  
78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?  
78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?  

78:21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;  
78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:  
78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,  
78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.  
78:25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.  

78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.  
78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:  
78:28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.  
78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;  
78:30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,  

78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.  
78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.  
78:33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.  
78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.  
78:35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.  

78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.  
78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.  
78:38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.  
78:39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.  
78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!  

78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.  
78:42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.  
78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:  
78:44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.  
78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.  

78:46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.  
78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.  
78:48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.  
78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.  
78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;  

78:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:  
78:52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.  
78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.  
78:54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.  
78:55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.  

78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:  
78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.  
78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.  
78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:  
78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;  

78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.  
78:62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.  
78:63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.  
78:64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.  
78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.  

78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.  
78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:  
78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.  
78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.  
78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:  

78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.  
78:72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

Psalms Chapter 79    
79:1 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.  
79:2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.  
79:3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.  
79:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.  
79:5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?  

79:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.  
79:7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.  
79:8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.  
79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.  
79:10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.  

79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;  
79:12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.  
79:13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.

Psalms Chapter 80      
80:1 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.  
80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.  
80:3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.  
80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?  
80:5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.  

80:6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.  
80:7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.  
80:8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.  
80:9 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.  
80:10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.  

80:11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.  
80:12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?  
80:13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.  
80:14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;  
80:15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.  

80:16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.  
80:17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.  
80:18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.  
80:19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

Psalms Chapter 81     
81:1 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.  
81:2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.  
81:3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.  
81:4 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.  
81:5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.  

81:6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.  
81:7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.  
81:8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;  
81:9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.  
81:10 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.  

81:11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.  
81:12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.  
81:13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!  
81:14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.  
81:15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.  

81:16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

Psalms Chapter 82   
82:1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.  
82:2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.  
82:3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.  
82:4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.  
82:5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.  

82:6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.  
82:7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.  
82:8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.

Psalms Chapter 83     
83:1 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.  
83:2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.  
83:3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.  
83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.  
83:5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:  

83:6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;  
83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;  
83:8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.  
83:9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:  
83:10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.  

83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:  
83:12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.  
83:13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.  
83:14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;  
83:15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.  

83:16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.  
83:17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:  
83:18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 84   
84:1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!  
84:2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.  
84:3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.  
84:4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.  
84:5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.  

84:6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.  
84:7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.  
84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.  
84:9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.  
84:10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.  

84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.  
84:12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 85    
85:1 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.  
85:2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.  
85:3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.  
85:4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.  
85:5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?  

85:6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?  
85:7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.  
85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.  
85:9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.  
85:10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.  

85:11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.  
85:12 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.  
85:13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.

Psalms Chapter 86     
86:1 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.  
86:2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.  
86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.  
86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.  
86:5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.  

86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.  
86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.  
86:8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.  
86:9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.  
86:10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.  

86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.  
86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.  
86:13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.  
86:14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.  
86:15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.  

86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.  
86:17 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.

Psalms Chapter 87  
87:1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.  
87:2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.  
87:3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.  
87:4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.  
87:5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.  

87:6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah.  
87:7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 88     
88:1 O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:  
88:2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;  
88:3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.  
88:4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:  
88:5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.  

88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.  
88:7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.  
88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.  
88:9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.  
88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.  

88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?  
88:12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?  
88:13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.  
88:14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?  
88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.  

88:16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.  
88:17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.  
88:18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 89           
89:1 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.  
89:2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.  
89:3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,  
89:4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.  
89:5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.  

89:6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?  
89:7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.  
89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?  
89:9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.  
89:10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.  

89:11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.  
89:12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.  
89:13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.  
89:14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.  
89:15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.  

89:16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.  
89:17 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.  
89:18 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.  
89:19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.  
89:20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:  

89:21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.  
89:22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.  
89:23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.  
89:24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.  
89:25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.  

89:26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.  
89:27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.  
89:28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.  
89:29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.  
89:30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;  

89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;  
89:32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.  
89:33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.  
89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.  
89:35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.  

89:36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.  
89:37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.  
89:38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.  
89:39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.  
89:40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.  

89:41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.  
89:42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.  
89:43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.  
89:44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.  
89:45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.  

89:46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?  
89:47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?  
89:48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.  
89:49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?  
89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;  

89:51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.  
89:52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

Psalms Chapter 90     
90:1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.  
90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.  
90:3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.  
90:4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.  
90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.  

90:6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.  
90:7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.  
90:8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.  
90:9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.  
90:10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.  

90:11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.  
90:12 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.  
90:13 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.  
90:14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.  
90:15 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.  

90:16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.  
90:17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.

Psalms Chapter 91     
91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  
91:2 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.  
91:3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.  
91:4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.  
91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;  

91:6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.  
91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.  
91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.  
91:9 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;  
91:10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.  

91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.  
91:12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.  
91:13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.  
91:14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.  
91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.  

91:16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

Psalms Chapter 92     
92:1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:  
92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,  
92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.  
92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.  
92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.  

92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.  
92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:  
92:8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.  
92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.  
92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.  

92:11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.  
92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.  
92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.  
92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;  
92:15 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

Psalms Chapter 93   
93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.  
93:2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.  
93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.  
93:4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.  
93:5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.

94:1 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.  
94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.  
94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?  
94:4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?  
94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.  

94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.  
94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.  
94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?  
94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?  
94:10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?  

94:11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.  
94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;  
94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.  
94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.  
94:15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.  

94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?  
94:17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.  
94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.  
94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.  
94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?  

94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.  
94:22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.  
94:23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.

Psalms Chapter 95    
95:1 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.  
95:2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.  
95:3 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.  
95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.  
95:5 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.  

95:6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.  
95:7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,  
95:8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:  
95:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.  
95:10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:  

95:11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 96    
96:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.  
96:2 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.  
96:3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.  
96:4 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.  
96:5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.  

96:6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.  
96:7 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.  
96:8 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.  
96:9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.  
96:10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.  

96:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.  
96:12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
96:13 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 97   
97:1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.  
97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.  
97:3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.  
97:4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.  
97:5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.  

97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.  
97:7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.  
97:8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.  
97:9 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.  
97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.  

97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.  
97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

Psalms Chapter 98   
98:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.  
98:2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.  
98:3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.  
98:4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.  
98:5 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.  

98:6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.  
98:7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.  
98:8 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together
98:9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 99   
99:1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.  
99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.  
99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.  
99:4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.  
99:5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.  

99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.  
99:7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.  
99:8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.  
99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.

Psalms Chapter 100   
100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.  
100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.  
100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.  
100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.  
100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.

Psalms Chapter 101   
101:1 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.  
101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.  
101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.  
101:4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.  
101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.  

101:6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.  
101:7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.  
101:8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

Psalms Chapter 102       
102:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.  
102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.  
102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.  
102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.  
102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.  

102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.  
102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.  
102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.  
102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,  
102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.  

102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.  
102:12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.  
102:13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.  
102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.  
102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.  

102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.  
102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.  
102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.  
102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;  
102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;  

102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;  
102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.  
102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.  
102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.  
102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.  

102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:  
102:27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.  
102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.

Psalms Chapter 103     
103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.  
103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:  
103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;  
103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;  
103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.  

103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.  
103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.  
103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.  
103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.  
103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.  

103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.  
103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.  
103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.  
103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.  
103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.  

103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.  
103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;  
103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.  
103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.  
103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.  

103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.  
103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.

Psalms Chapter 104         
104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.  
104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:  
104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:  
104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:  
104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.  

104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.  
104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.  
104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.  
104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.  
104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.  

104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.  
104:12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.  
104:13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.  
104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;  
104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.  

104:16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;  
104:17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.  
104:18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.  
104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.  
104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.  

104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.  
104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.  
104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.  
104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.  
104:25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.  

104:26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.  
104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.  
104:28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.  
104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.  
104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.  

104:31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.  
104:32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.  
104:33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.  
104:34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.  
104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.

Psalms Chapter 105          
105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.  
105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.  
105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.  
105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.  
105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;  

105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.  
105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.  
105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.  
105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;  
105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:  

105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:  
105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.  
105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;  
105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;  
105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.  

105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.  
105:17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:  
105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:  
105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.  
105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.  

105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:  
105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.  
105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.  
105:24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.  
105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.  

105:26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.  
105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.  
105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.  
105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.  
105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.  

105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.  
105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.  
105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.  
105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,  
105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.  

105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.  
105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.  
105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.  
105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.  
105:40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.  

105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.  
105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.  
105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:  
105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;  
105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.

Psalms Chapter 106          
106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.  
106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?  
106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.  
106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;  
106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.  

106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.  
106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.  
106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.  
106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.  
106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.  

106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.  
106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.  
106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:  
106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.  
106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.  

106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.  
106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.  
106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.  
106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.  
106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.  

106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;  
106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.  
106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.  
106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:  
106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.  

106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:  
106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.  
106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.  
106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.  
106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.  

106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.  
106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:  
106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.  
106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:  
106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.  

106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.  
106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,  
106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.  
106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.  
106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.  

106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.  
106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.  
106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.  
106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:  
106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.  

106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.  
106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.  
106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.

Psalms Chapter 107         
107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.  
107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;  
107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.  
107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.  
107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.  

107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.  
107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.  
107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!  
107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.  
107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;  

107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:  
107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.  
107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.  
107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.  
107:15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!  

107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.  
107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.  
107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.  
107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.  
107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.  

107:21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!  
107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.  
107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;  
107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.  
107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.  

107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.  
107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.  
107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.  
107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.  
107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.  

107:31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!  
107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.  
107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;  
107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.  
107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.  

107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;  
107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.  
107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.  
107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.  
107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.  

107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.  
107:42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.  
107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.

Psalms Chapter 108    
108:1 O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.  
108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.  
108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.  
108:4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.  
108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;  

108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.  
108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.  
108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;  
108:9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.  
108:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?  

108:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?  
108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.  
108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

Psalms Chapter 109        
109:1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;  
109:2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.  
109:3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.  
109:4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.  
109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.  

109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.  
109:7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.  
109:8 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.  
109:9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.  
109:10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.  

109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.  
109:12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.  
109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.  
109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.  
109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.  

109:16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.  
109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.  
109:18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.  
109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.  
109:20 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.  

109:21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.  
109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.  
109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.  
109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.  
109:25 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.  

109:26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:  
109:27 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.  
109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.  
109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.  
109:30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.  

109:31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.

Psalms Chapter 110  
110:1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.  
110:2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.  
110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.  
110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.  
110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.  

110:6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.  
110:7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 111   
111:1 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.  
111:2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.  
111:3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.  
111:4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.  
111:5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.  

111:6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.  
111:7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.  
111:8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.  
111:9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.  
111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 112   
112:1 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.  
112:2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.  
112:3 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.  
112:4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.  
112:5 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.  

112:6 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.  
112:7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.  
112:8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.  
112:9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.  
112:10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.

Psalms Chapter 113   
113:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.  
113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.  
113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised.  
113:4 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.  
113:5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,  

113:6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!  
113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;  
113:8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.  
113:9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.

Psalms Chapter 114   
114:1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;  
114:2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.  
114:3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.  
114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.  
114:5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?  

114:6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?  
114:7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;  
114:8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

Psalms Chapter 115     
115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.  
115:2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?  
115:3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.  
115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.  
115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:  

115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:  
115:7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.  
115:8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.  
115:9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.  
115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.  

115:11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.  
115:12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.  
115:13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.  
115:14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.  
115:15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.  

115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.  
115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.  
115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.

Psalms Chapter 116      
116:1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.  
116:2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.  
116:3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.  
116:4 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.  
116:5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.  

116:6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.  
116:7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.  
116:8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.  
116:9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.  
116:10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:  

116:11 I said in my haste, All men are liars.  
116:12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?  
116:13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.  
116:14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.  
116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.  

116:16 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.  
116:17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.  
116:18 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,  
116:19 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

Psalms Chapter 118       
118:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.  
118:2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.  
118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.  
118:4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.  
118:5 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.  

118:6 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?  
118:7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.  
118:8 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.  
118:9 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.  
118:10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.  

118:11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.  
118:12 They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.  
118:13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.  
118:14 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.  
118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.  

118:16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.  
118:17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.  
118:18 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.  
118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:  
118:20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.  

118:21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.  
118:22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.  
118:23 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.  
118:24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.  
118:25 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.  

118:26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.  
118:27 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.  
118:28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.  
118:29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

Psalms Chapter 119       
119:1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.  
119:2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.  
119:3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.  
119:4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.  
119:5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!  

119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.  
119:7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.  
119:8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.  
119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.  
119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.  

119:11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.  
119:12 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.  
119:13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.  
119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.  
119:15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.  

119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.  
119:17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.  
119:18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.  
119:19 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.  
119:20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.  

119:21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.  
119:22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.  
119:23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.  
119:24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.  
119:25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.  

119:26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.  
119:27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.  
119:28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.  
119:29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.  
119:30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.  

119:31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.  
119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.  
119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.  
119:34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.  
119:35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.  

119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.  
119:37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.  
119:38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.  
119:39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.  
119:40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.  

119:41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.  
119:42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.  
119:43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.  
119:44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.  
119:45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.  

119:46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.  
119:47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.  
119:48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.  
119:49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.  
119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.  

119:51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.  
119:52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.  
119:53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.  
119:54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.  
119:55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.  

119:56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.  
119:57 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.  
119:58 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.  
119:59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.  
119:60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.  

119:61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.  
119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.  
119:63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.  
119:64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.  
119:65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.  

119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.  
119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.  
119:68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.  
119:69 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.  
119:70 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.  

119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.  
119:72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.  
119:73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.  
119:74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.  
119:75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.  

119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.  
119:77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.  
119:78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.  
119:79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.  
119:80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.  

119:81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.  
119:82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?  
119:83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.  
119:84 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?  
119:85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.  

119:86 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.  
119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.  
119:88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.  
119:89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.  
119:90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.  

119:91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.  
119:92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.  
119:93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.  
119:94 I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.  
119:95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.  

119:96 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.  
119:97 O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.  
119:98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.  
119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.  
119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.  

119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.  
119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.  
119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!  
119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.  
119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.  

119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.  
119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.  
119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.  
119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.  
119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.  

119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.  
119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.  
119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.  
119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.  
119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.  

119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.  
119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.  
119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.  
119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.  
119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.  

119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.  
119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.  
119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.  
119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.  
119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.  

119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.  
119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.  
119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.  
119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.  
119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.  

119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.  
119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.  
119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.  
119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.  
119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.  

119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.  
119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.  
119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.  
119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.  
119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.  

119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.  
119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.  
119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.  
119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.  
119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.  

119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.  
119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.  
119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.  
119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.  
119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.  

119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.  
119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.  
119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.  
119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.  
119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.  

119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.  
119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.  
119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.  
119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.  
119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.  

119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.  
119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.  
119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.  
119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.  
119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.  

119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.  
119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.  
119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.  
119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.  
119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.  

119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.  
119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.  
119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.  
119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight.  
119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.  

119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.

Psalms Chapter 120  
120:1 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.  
120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.  
120:3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?  
120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.  
120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!  

120:6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.  
120:7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.

122:1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.  
122:2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.  
122:3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:  
122:4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.  
122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.  

122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.  
122:7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

123:1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.  
123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.  
123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.  
123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

Psalms Chapter 124   8
124:1 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;  
124:2 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:  
124:3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:  
124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:  
124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.  

124:6 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.  
124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.  
124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.

125:1 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.  
125:2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.  
125:3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.  
125:4 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.  
125:5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.

Psalms Chapter 126  
126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.  
126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.  
126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.  
126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.  
126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.  

126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.

Psalms Chapter 127   
127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.  
127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.  
127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.  
127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.  
127:5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.

129:2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.  
129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.  
129:4 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.  
129:5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.  

129:6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:  
129:7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.

Psalms Chapter 132     
132:1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:  
132:2 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;  
132:3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;  
132:4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,  
132:5 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.  

132:6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.  
132:7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.  
132:8 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.  
132:9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.  
132:10 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.  

132:11 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.  
132:12 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.  
132:13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.  
132:14 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.  
132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.  

132:16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.  
132:17 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.  
132:18 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.

Psalms Chapter 133  
133:1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!  
133:2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;  
133:3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.

135:3 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.  
135:4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.  
135:5 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.  

135:6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.  
135:7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.  
135:8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.  
135:9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.  
135:10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;  

135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:  
135:12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.  
135:13 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.  
135:14 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.  
135:15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.  

135:16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;  
135:17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.  
135:18 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.  
135:19 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:  
135:20 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.  

135:21 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

136:24 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.  
136:25 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.

Psalms Chapter 137   
137:1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.  
137:2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.  
137:3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.  
137:4 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?  
137:5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.  

137:6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.  
137:7 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.  
137:8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.  
137:9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.

138:3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.  
138:4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.  
138:5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.  

138:6 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.  
138:7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.  
138:8 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.

Psalms Chapter 139     
139:1 O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.  
139:2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.  
139:3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.  
139:4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.  
139:5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.  

139:6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.  
139:7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?  
139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.  
139:9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;  
139:10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.  

139:11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.  
139:12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.  
139:13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.  
139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.  
139:15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.  

139:16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.  
139:17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!  
139:18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.  
139:19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.  
139:20 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.  

139:21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?  
139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.  
139:23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:  
139:24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

Psalms Chapter 140    
140:1 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;  
140:2 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.  
140:3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.  
140:4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.  
140:5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.  

140:6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.  
140:7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.  
140:8 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.  
140:9 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.  
140:10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.  

140:11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.  
140:12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.  
140:13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.

Psalms Chapter 141   
141:1 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.  
141:2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.  
141:3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.  
141:4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.  
141:5 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.  

141:6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.  
141:7 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.  
141:8 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.  
141:9 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.  
141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 142  
142:1 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.  
142:2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.  
142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.  
142:4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.  
142:5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.  

142:6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.  
142:7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.  

* ----------------------------------------
Psalms Chapter 143   
143:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.  
143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.  
143:3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.  
143:4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.  
143:5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.  

143:6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.  
143:7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.  
143:8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.  
143:9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.  
143:10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.  

143:11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.  
143:12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.

Psalms Chapter 144     
144:1 Blessed be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:  
144:2 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.  
144:3 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!  
144:4 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.  
144:5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.  

144:6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.  
144:7 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;  
144:8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.  
144:9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.  
144:10 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.  

144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:  
144:12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:  
144:13 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:  
144:14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.  
144:15 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.

145:14 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.  
145:15 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.  

145:16 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.  
145:17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.  
145:18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.  
145:19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.

146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.  
146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.  
146:5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:  

146:6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:  
146:7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:  
146:8 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:  
146:9 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

诗篇 1章  

1:1 不从恶人的计谋、不站罪人的道路、不坐亵慢人的座位、  
1:2 惟喜爱耶和华的律法、昼夜思想、这人便为有福。  
1:3 他要像一棵树栽在溪水旁、按时候结果子、叶子也不枯干。凡他所作的、尽都顺利。  
1:4 恶人并不是这样、乃像糠秕被风吹散。  
1:5 因此当审判的时候、恶人必站立不住。罪人在义人的会中、也是如此。  

1:6 因为耶和华知道义人的道路。恶人的道路、却必灭亡。

2:1 外邦为甚么争闹、万民为甚么谋算虚妄的事。  
2:2 世上的君王一齐起来、臣宰一同商议、要敌挡耶和华、并他的受膏者、  
2:3 说、我们要挣开他们的捆绑、脱去他们的绳索。  
2:4 那坐在天上的必发笑。主必嗤笑他们。  
2:5 那时他要在怒中责备他们、在烈怒中惊吓他们、  

2:6 说、我已经立我的君在锡安我的圣山上了。  
2:7 受膏者说、我要传圣旨。耶和华曾对我说、你是我的儿子、我今日生你。  
2:8 你求我、我就将列国赐你为基业、将地极赐你为田产。  
2:9 你必用铁杖打破他们。你必将他们如同窑匠的瓦器摔碎。  
2:10 现在你们君王应当省悟。你们世上的审判官该受管教。  

2:11 当存畏惧事奉耶和华、又当存战兢而快乐。  
2:12 当以嘴亲子、恐怕他发怒、你们便在道中灭亡、因为他的怒气快要发作。凡投靠他的、都是有福的。

3:1 〔大卫逃避他儿子押沙龙的时候作的诗。〕耶和华阿、我的敌人何其加增。有许多人起来攻击我。  
3:2 有许多人议论我说、他得不着　神的帮助。〔细拉〕  
3:3 但你耶和华是我四围的盾牌。是我的荣耀、又是叫我抬起头来的。  
3:4 我用我的声音求告耶和华、他就从他的圣山上应允我。〔细拉〕  
3:5 我躺下睡觉。我醒着。耶和华都保佑我。  

3:6 虽有成万的百姓来周围攻击我、我也不怕。

4:2 你们这上流人哪、你们将我的尊荣变为羞辱、要到几时呢。你们喜爱虚妄、寻找虚假、要到几时呢。〔细拉〕  
4:3 你们要知道耶和华已经分别虔诚人归他自己。我求告耶和华、他必听我。  
4:4 你们应当畏惧、不可犯罪。在床上的时候、要心里思想、并要肃静。〔细拉〕  
4:5 当献上公义的祭、又当倚靠耶和华。  

4:6 有许多人说、谁能指示我们甚么好处。耶和华阿、求你仰起脸来、光照我们。

5:2 我的王我的　神阿、求你垂听我呼求的声音。因为我向你祈祷。  
5:3 耶和华阿、早晨你必听我的声音。早晨我必向你陈明我的心意、并要儆醒。  
5:4 因为你不是喜悦恶事的　神。恶人不能与你同居。  
5:5 狂傲人不能站在你眼前。凡作孽的、都是你所恨恶的。  

5:6 说谎言的、你必灭绝。好流人血弄诡诈的、都为耶和华所憎恶。  
5:7 至于我、我必凭你丰盛的慈爱进入你的居所。我必存敬畏你的心向你的圣殿下拜。  
5:8 耶和华阿、求你因我的仇敌、凭你的公义、引领我。使你的道路在我面前正直。  
5:9 因为他们的口中没有诚实。他们的心里满有邪恶。他们的喉咙、是敞开的坟墓。他们用舌头谄媚人。  
5:10 　神阿、求你定他们的罪。愿他们因自己的计谋跌倒。愿你在他们许多的过犯中、把他们逐出。因为他们背叛了你。  

5:11 凡投靠你的、愿他们喜乐、时常欢呼、因为你护庇他们。又愿那爱你名的人、都靠你欢欣。  
5:12 因为你必赐福与义人。耶和华阿、你必用恩惠如同盾牌四面护卫他。

诗篇 6章   

6:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长、用丝弦的乐器、调用第八。〕耶和华阿、求你不要在怒中责备我、也不要在烈怒中惩罚我。  
6:2 耶和华阿、求你可怜我。因为我软弱。耶和华阿、求你医治我。因为我的骨头发战。  
6:3 我心也大大的惊惶。耶和华阿、你要到几时才救我呢。  
6:4 耶和华阿、求你转回、搭救我。因你的慈爱拯救我。  
6:5 因为在死地无人记念你、在阴间有谁称谢你。  

6:6 我因唉哼而困乏。我每夜流泪、把床榻漂起、把褥子湿透。  
6:7 我因忧愁眼睛干瘪。又因我一切的敌人眼睛昏花。  
6:8 你们一切作孽的人、离开我吧。因为耶和华听了我哀哭的声音。  
6:9 耶和华听了我的恳求。耶和华必收纳我的祷告。  
6:10 我的一切仇敌都必羞愧、大大惊惶。他们必要退后、忽然羞愧。

7:2 恐怕他们像狮子撕裂我、甚至撕碎、无人搭救。  
7:3 耶和华我的　神阿、我若行了这事、若有罪孽在我手里、  
7:4 我若以恶报那与我交好的人、（连那无故与我为敌的、我也救了他)
7:5 就任凭仇敌追赶我、直到追上。将我的性命踏在地下、使我的荣耀归于灰尘。〔细拉〕  

7:6 耶和华阿、求你在怒中起来、挺身而立、抵挡我敌人的暴怒。求你为我兴起。你已经命定施行审判。  
7:7 愿众民的会环绕你。愿你从其上归于高位。  
7:8 耶和华向众民施行审判。耶和华阿、求你按我的公义、和我心中的纯正、判断我。  
7:9 愿恶人的恶断绝。愿你坚立义人。因为公义的　神察验人的心肠肺腑。  
7:10 　神是我的盾牌。他拯救心里正直的人。  

7:11 　神是公义的审判者、又是天天向恶人发怒的　神。  
7:12 若有人不回头、他的刀必磨快、弓必上弦、预备妥当了。  
7:13 他也预备了杀人的器械。他所射的是火箭。  
7:14 试看恶人因奸恶而劬劳。所怀的是毒害、所生的是虚假。  
7:15 他掘了坑、又挖深了、竟掉在自己所挖的阱里。  

7:16 他的毒害、必临到他自己的头上。他的强暴必落到他自己的脑袋上。  
7:17 我要照着耶和华的公义称谢他、歌颂耶和华至高者的名。

8:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长、用迦特乐器。〕耶和华我们的主阿、你的名在全地何其美。你将你的荣耀彰显于天。  
8:2 你因敌人的缘故、从婴孩和吃奶的口中、建立了能力、使仇敌和报仇的、闭口无言。  
8:3 我观看你指头所造的天、并你所陈设的月亮星宿、  
8:4 便说、人算甚么、你竟顾念他。世人算甚么、你竟眷顾他。  
8:5 你叫他比天使〔或作　神〕微小一点、并赐他荣耀尊贵为冠冕。  

8:6 你派他管理你手所造的、使万物、就是一切的牛羊、田野的兽、空中的鸟、海里的鱼、凡经行海道的、都服在他的脚下。  
8:7 见上节
8:8 见上节
8:9 耶和华我们的主阿、你的名在全地何其美。

诗篇 9章    

9:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长、调用慕拉便。〕我要一心称谢耶和华。我要传扬你一切奇妙的作为。  
9:2 我要因你欢喜快乐。至高者阿、我要歌颂你的名。  
9:3 我的仇敌转身退去的时候、他们一见你的面、就跌倒灭亡。  
9:4 因你已经为我伸冤、为我辨屈。你坐在宝座上、按公义审判。  
9:5 你曾斥责外邦。你曾灭绝恶人。你曾涂抹他们的名、直到永永远远。  

9:6 仇敌到了尽头。他们被毁坏、直到永远。你拆毁他们的城邑。连他们的名号、都归于无有。  
9:7 惟耶和华坐着为王、直到永远。他已经为审判设摆他的宝座。  
9:8 他要按公义审判世界、按正直判断万民。  
9:9 耶和华又要给受欺压的人作高台、在患难的时候作高台。  
9:10 耶和华阿、认识你名的人要倚靠你。因你没有离弃寻求你的人。  

9:11 应当歌颂居锡安的耶和华、将他所行的传扬在众民中。  
9:12 因为那追讨流人血之罪的、他记念受屈的人、不忘记困苦人的哀求。  
9:13 耶和华阿、你是从死门把我提拔起来的。求你怜恤我。看那恨我的人所加给我的苦难。  
9:14 好叫我述说你一切的美德。我必在锡安城的门、〔城原文作女子〕因你的救恩欢乐。  
9:15 外邦人陷在自己所掘的坑中。他们的脚在自己暗设的网罗里缠住了。  

9:16 耶和华已将自己显明了、他已施行审判。恶人被自己手所作的缠住了。〔或作他叫恶人被自己手所作的累住了〕〔细拉〕  
9:17 恶人、就是忘记　神的外邦人、都必归到阴间。  
9:18 穷乏人必不永久被忘、困苦人的指望、必不永远落空。  
9:19 耶和华阿、求你起来、不容人得胜。愿外邦人在你面前受审判。  
9:20 耶和华阿、求你使外邦人恐惧。愿他们知道自己不过是人。〔细拉〕

诗篇 10章    

10:1 耶和华阿、你为甚么站在远处。在患难的时候、为甚么隐藏。  
10:2 恶人在骄横中、把困苦人追得火急。愿他们陷在自己所设的计谋里。  
10:3 因为恶人以心愿自夸。贪财的背弃耶和华、并且轻慢他。〔或作他祝福贪财的却轻慢耶和华〕  
10:4 恶人面带骄傲、说、耶和华必不追究。他一切所想的、都以为没有　神。  
10:5 凡他所作的、时常稳固。你的审判超过他的眼界。至于他一切的敌人、他都向他们喷气。  

10:6 他心里说、我必不动摇、世世代代不遭灾难。  
10:7 他满口是咒骂、诡诈、欺压。舌底是毒害奸恶。  
10:8 他在村庄埋伏等候。他在隐密处杀害无辜的人。他的眼睛窥探无倚无靠的人。  
10:9 他埋伏在暗地、如狮子蹲在洞中。他埋伏、要掳去困苦人。他拉网、就把困苦人掳去。  
10:10 他屈身蹲伏、无倚无靠的人、就倒在他爪牙之下、〔爪牙或作强暴人〕  

10:11 他心里说、　神竟忘记了。他掩面、永不观看。  
10:12 耶和华阿、求你起来。　神阿、求你举手。不要忘记困苦人。  
10:13 恶人为何轻慢　神、心里说、你必不追究。  
10:14 其实你已经观看。因为奸恶毒害、你都看见了、为要以手施行报应。无倚无靠的人、把自己交托你。你向来是帮助孤儿的。  
10:15 愿你打断恶人的膀臂。至于坏人、愿你追究他的恶、直到净尽。  

10:16 耶和华永永远远为王。外邦人从他的地已经灭绝了。  
10:17 耶和华阿、谦卑人的心愿、你早已知道。〔原文作听见〕你必预备他们的心、也必侧耳听他们的祈求。  
10:18 为要给孤儿和受欺压的人伸冤、使强横的人不再威吓他们。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 11章   

11:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕我是投靠耶和华。你们怎么对我说、你当像鸟飞往你的山去。  
11:2 看哪、恶人弯弓、把箭搭在弦上、要在暗中射那心里正直的人。  
11:3 根基若毁坏、义人还能作甚么呢。  
11:4 耶和华在他的圣殿里。耶和华的宝座在天上。他的慧眼察看世人。  
11:5 耶和华试验义人。惟有恶人和喜爱强暴的人、他心里恨恶。  

11:6 他要向恶人密布网罗。有烈火、硫磺、热风、作他们杯中的分。  
11:7 因为耶和华是公义的。他喜爱公义。正直人必得见他的面。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 12章   

12:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长、调用第八。〕耶和华阿、求你帮助、因虔诚人断绝了。世人中间的忠信人没有了。  
12:2 人人向邻舍说谎。他们说话、是嘴唇油滑、心口不一。  
12:3 凡油滑的嘴唇、和夸大的舌头、耶和华必要剪除。  
12:4 他们曾说、我们必能以舌头得胜。我们的嘴唇是我们自己的。谁能作我们的主呢。  
12:5 耶和华说、因为困苦人的冤屈、和贫穷人的叹息、我现在要起来、把他安置在他所切慕的稳妥之地。  

12:6 耶和华的言语、是纯净的言语。如同银子在泥炉中炼过七次。  
12:7 耶和华阿、你必保护他们。你必保佑他们永远脱离这世代的人。  
12:8 下流人在世人中升高、就有恶人到处游行。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 13章  

13:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕耶和华阿、你忘记我要到几时呢。要到永远么。你掩面不顾我要到几时呢。  
13:2 我心里筹算、终日愁苦、要到几时呢。我的仇敌升高压制我、要到几时呢。  
13:3 耶和华我的　神阿、求你看顾我、应允我、使我眼目光明、免得我沉睡至死。  
13:4 免得我的仇敌说、我胜了他。免得我的敌人在我摇动的时候喜乐。  
13:5 但我倚靠你的慈爱。我的心因你的救恩快乐。  

13:6 我要向耶和华歌唱、因他用厚恩待我。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 14章   

14:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕愚顽人心里说、没有　神。他们都是邪恶、行了可憎恶的事。没有一个人行善。  
14:2 耶和华从天上垂看世人、要看有明白的没有、有寻求　神的没有。  
14:3 他们都偏离正路、一同变为污秽。并没有行善的、连一个也没有。  
14:4 作孽的都没有知识么。他们吞吃我的百姓、如同吃饭一样、并不求告耶和华。  
14:5 他们在那里大大的害怕、因为　神在义人的族类中。  

14:6 你们叫困苦人的谋算、变为羞辱。然而耶和华是他的避难所。  
14:7 但愿以色列的救恩从锡安而出。耶和华救回他被掳的子民、那时雅各要快乐、以色列要欢喜。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 15章   

15:1 〔大卫的诗。〕耶和华阿、谁能寄居你的帐幕。谁能住在你的圣山。  
15:2 就是行为正直、作事公义、心里说实话的人。  
15:3 他不以舌头谗谤人、不恶待朋友、也不随伙毁谤邻里。  
15:4 他眼中藐视匪类、却尊重那敬畏耶和华的人。他发了誓、虽然自己吃亏、也不更改。  
15:5 他不放债取利、不受贿赂以害无辜。行这些事的人、必永不动摇。  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 16章   

16:1 〔大卫的金诗。〕　神阿、求你保佑我、因为我投靠你。  
16:2 我的心哪、你曾对耶和华说、你是我的主。我的好处不在你以外。  
16:3 论到世上的圣民、他们又美又善、是我最喜悦的。  
16:4 以别神代替耶和华的、〔或作送礼物给别神的〕他们的愁苦必加增。他们所浇奠的血我不献上、我嘴唇也不提别神的名号。  
16:5 耶和华是我的产业、是我杯中的分。我所得的你为我持守。  

16:6 用绳量给我的地界、坐落在佳美之处。我的产业实在美好。  
16:7 我必称颂那指教我的耶和华。我的心肠在夜间也警戒我。  
16:8 我将耶和华常摆在我面前。因他在我右边、我便不至摇动。  
16:9 因此我的心欢喜、我的灵〔原文作荣耀〕快乐。我的肉身也要安然居住。  
16:10 因为你必不将我的灵魂撇在阴间。也不叫你的圣者见朽坏。  

16:11 你必将生命的道路指示我。在你面前有满足的喜乐。在你右手中有永远的福乐。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 17章    

17:1 〔大卫的祈祷。〕耶和华阿、求你听闻公义、侧耳听我的呼吁。求你留心听我这不出于诡诈嘴唇的祈祷。  
17:2 愿我的判语从你面前发出。愿你的眼睛观看公正。  
17:3 你已经试验我的心。你在夜间鉴察我。你熬炼我、却找不着甚么。我立志叫我口中没有过失。  
17:4 论到人的行为、我借着你嘴唇的言语、自己谨守、不行强暴人的道路。  
17:5 我的脚踏定了你的路径、我的两脚未曾滑跌。  

17:6 　神阿、我曾求告你、因为你必应允我。求你向我侧耳、听我的言语。  
17:7 求你显出你奇妙的慈爱来。你是那用右手拯救投靠你的、脱离起来攻击他们的人。  
17:8 求你保护我、如同保护眼中的瞳人。将我隐藏在你翅膀的荫下、  
17:9 使我脱离那欺压我的恶人、就是围困我、要害我命的仇敌。  
17:10 他们的心被脂油包裹。他们用口说骄傲的话。  

17:11 他们围困了我们的脚步。他们瞪着眼、要把我们推倒在地。  
17:12 他像狮子急要抓食、又像少壮狮子蹲伏在暗处。  
17:13 耶和华阿、求你起来、前去迎敌、将他打倒。用你的刀救护我命脱离恶人。  
17:14 耶和华阿、求你用手救我脱离世人、脱离那只在今生有福分的世人。你把你的财宝充满他们的肚腹。他们因有儿女就心满意足、将其余的财物留给他们的婴孩。  
17:15 至于我、我必在义中见你的面。我醒了的时候、得见你的形像、〔见或作看〕就心满意足了。  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 18章       

18:1 〔耶和华的仆人大卫的诗、交与伶长。当耶和华救他脱离一切仇敌和扫罗之手的日子、他向耶和华念这诗的话。说、〕耶和华我的力量阿、我爱你。  
18:2 耶和华是我的岩石、我的山寨、我的救主、我的　神、我的磐石、我所投靠的。他是我的盾牌、是拯救我的角、是我的高台。  
18:3 我要求告当赞美的耶和华。这样我必从仇敌手中被救出来。  
18:4 曾有死亡的绳索缠绕我。匪类的急流使我惊惧。  
18:5 阴间的绳索缠绕我。死亡的网罗临到我。  

18:6 我在急难中求告耶和华、向我的　神呼求。他从殿中听了我的声音、我在他面前的呼求入了他的耳中。  
18:7 那时因他发怒、地就摇撼战抖、山的根基也震动摇撼。  
18:8 从他鼻孔冒烟上腾、从他口中发火焚烧。连炭也着了。  
18:9 他又使天下垂、亲自降临。有黑云在他脚下。  
18:10 他坐着基路伯飞行。他借着风的翅膀快飞。  

18:11 他以黑暗为藏身之处、以水的黑暗、天空的厚云、为他四围的行宫。  
18:12 因他面前的光辉、他的厚云行过。便有冰雹火炭。  
18:13 耶和华也在天上打雷。至高者发出声音、便有冰雹火炭。  
18:14 他射出箭来、使仇敌四散。多多发出闪电、使他们扰乱。  
18:15 耶和华阿、你的斥责一发、你鼻孔的气一出、海底就出现、大地的根基也显露。  

18:16 他从高天伸手抓住我。把我从大水中拉上来。  
18:17 他救我脱离我的劲敌、和那些恨我的人。因为他们比我强盛。  
18:18 我遭遇灾难的日子、他们来攻击我。但耶和华是我的倚靠。  
18:19 他又领我到宽阔之处。他救拔我、因他喜悦我。  
18:20 耶和华按着我的公义报答我、按着我手中的清洁赏赐我。  

18:21 因为我遵守了耶和华的道、未曾作恶离开我的　神。  
18:22 他的一切典章常在我面前。他的律例我也未曾丢弃。  
18:23 我在他面前作了完全人。我也保守自己远离我的罪孽。  
18:24 所以耶和华按我的公义、按我在他眼前手中的清洁、偿还我。  
18:25 慈爱的人、你以慈爱待他。完全的人、你以完全待他。  

18:26 清洁的人、你以清洁待他。乖僻的人、你以弯曲待他。  
18:27 困苦的百姓、你必拯救。高傲的眼目、你必使他降卑。  
18:28 你必点着我的灯。耶和华我的　神必照明我的黑暗。  
18:29 我借着你冲入敌军、借着我的　神跳过墙垣。  
18:30 至于　神、他的道是完全的。耶和华的话是炼净的。凡投靠他的、他便作他们的盾牌。  

18:31 除了耶和华、谁是　神呢。除了我们的　神、谁是磐石呢。  
18:32 惟有那以力量束我的腰、使我行为完全的、他是　神。  
18:33 他使我的脚快如母鹿的蹄、又使我在高处安稳。  
18:34 他教导我的手能以争战、甚至我的膀臂能开铜弓。  
18:35 你把你的救恩给我作盾牌。你的右手扶持我。你的温和使我为大。  

18:36 你使我脚下的地步宽阔。我的脚未曾滑跌。  
18:37 我要追赶我的仇敌、并要追上他们。不将他们灭绝、我总不归回。  
18:38 我要打伤他们、使他们不能起来。他们必倒在我的脚下。  
18:39 因为你曾以力量束我的腰、使我能争战。你也使那起来攻击我的都服在我以下。  
18:40 你又使我的仇敌在我面前转背逃跑、叫我能以剪除那恨我的人。  

18:41 他们呼求、却无人拯救、就是呼求耶和华、他也不应允。  
18:42 我捣碎他们、如同风前的灰尘、倒出他们、如同街上的泥土。  
18:43 你救我脱离百姓的争竞、立我作列国的元首。我素不认识的民必事奉我。  
18:44 他们一听见我的名声、就必顺从我。外邦人要投降我。  
18:45 外邦人要衰残、战战兢兢的出他们的营寨。  

18:46 耶和华是活　神。愿我的磐石被人称颂。愿救我的　神被人尊崇。  
18:47 这位　神、就是那为我伸冤、使众民服在我以下的。  
18:48 你救我脱离仇敌。又把我举起、高过那些起来攻击我的。你救我脱离强暴的人。  
18:49 耶和华阿、因此我要在外邦中称谢你、歌颂你的名。  
18:50 耶和华赐极大的救恩给他所立的王、施慈爱给他的受膏者、就是给大卫和他的后裔、直到永远。

诗篇 19章   

19:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕诸天述说　神的荣耀。穹苍传扬他的手段。  
19:2 这日到那日发出言语。这夜到那夜传出知识。  
19:3 无言无语、也无声音可听。  
19:4 它的量带通遍天下、它的言语传到地极。　神在其间为太阳安设帐幕。  
19:5 太阳如同新郎出洞房、又如勇士欢然奔路。  

19:6 它从天这边出来、绕到天那边。没有一物被隐藏不得它的热气。  
19:7 耶和华的律法全备、能苏醒人心。耶和华的法度确定、能使愚人有智慧。  
19:8 耶和华的训词正直、能快活人的心。耶和华的命令清洁、能明亮人的眼目。  
19:9 耶和华的道理洁净、存到永远。耶和华的典章真实、全然公义。  
19:10 都比金子可羡慕、且比极多的精金可羡慕。比蜜甘甜、且比蜂房下滴的蜜甘甜。  

19:11 况且你的仆人因此受警戒、守着这些便有大赏。  
19:12 谁能知道自己的错失呢。愿你赦免我隐而未现的过错。  
19:13 求你拦阻仆人、不犯任意妄为的罪。不容这罪辖制我。我便完全、免犯大罪。  
19:14 耶和华我的磐石、我的救赎主阿、愿我口中的言语、心里的意念、在你面前蒙悦纳。

20:3 记念你的一切供献、悦纳你的燔祭。〔细拉〕  
20:4 将你心所愿的赐给你、成就你的一切筹算。  
20:5 我们要因你的救恩夸胜、要奉我们　神的名竖立旌旗。愿耶和华成就你一切所求的。  

20:6 现在我知道耶和华救护他的受膏者、必从他的圣天上应允他、用右手的能力救护他。  
20:7 有人靠车、有人靠马、但我们要提到耶和华我们　神的名。  
20:8 他们都屈身仆倒、我们却起来、立得正直。

诗篇 21章   

21:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕耶和华阿、王必因你的能力欢喜。因你的救恩、他的快乐何其大。  
21:2 他心里所愿的、你已经赐给他。他嘴唇所求的、你未尝不应允。〔细拉〕  
21:3 你以美福迎接他、把精金的冠冕戴在他头上。  
21:4 他向你求寿、你便赐给他、就是日子长久、直到永远。  
21:5 他因你的救恩大有荣耀。你又将尊荣威严加在他身上。  

21:6 你使他有洪福、直到永远。又使他在你面前欢喜快乐。  
21:7 王倚靠耶和华、因至高者的慈爱必不摇动。  
21:8 你的手要搜出你的一切仇敌。你的右手要搜出那些恨你的人。  
21:9 你发怒的时候、要使他们如在炎热的火炉中。耶和华要在他的震怒中吞灭他们。那火要把他们烧尽了。  
21:10 你必从世上灭绝他们的子孙、〔子孙原文作果子〕从人间灭绝他们的后裔。  

21:11 因为他们有意加害于你。他们想出计谋、却不能作成。  
21:12 你必使他们转背逃跑、向他们的脸搭箭在弦。  
21:13 耶和华阿、愿你因自己的能力显为至高。这样、我们就唱诗、歌颂你的大能。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 22章      

22:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长、调用朝鹿。〕我的　神、我的　神、为甚么离弃我。为甚么远离不救我、不听我唉哼的言语。  
22:2 我的　神阿、我白日呼求、你不应允。夜间呼求、并不住声。  
22:3 但你是圣洁的、是用以色列的赞美为宝座的。〔宝座或作居所〕  
22:4 我们的祖宗倚靠你。他们倚靠你、你便解救他们。  
22:5 他们哀求你、便蒙解救。他们倚靠你、就不羞愧。  

22:6 但我是虫不是人。被众人羞辱、被百姓藐视。  
22:7 凡看见我的都嗤笑我。他们撇嘴摇头、说、  
22:8 他把自己交托耶和华、耶和华可以救他吧。耶和华既喜悦他、可以搭救他吧。  
22:9 但你是叫我出母腹的。我在母怀里、你就使我有倚靠的心。  
22:10 我自出母胎就被交在你手里。从我母亲生我、你就是我的　神。  

22:11 求你不要远离我。因为急难临近了、没有人帮助我。  
22:12 有许多公牛围绕我。巴珊大力的公牛四面困住我。  
22:13 他们向我张口、好像抓撕吼叫的狮子。  
22:14 我如水被倒出来。我的骨头都脱了节。我心在我里面如蜡融化。  
22:15 我的精力枯干、如同瓦片。我的舌头贴在我牙床上。你将我安置在死地的尘土中。  

22:16 犬类围着我。恶党环绕我。他们扎了我的手、我的脚。  
22:17 我的骨头、我都能数过。他们瞪着眼看我。  
22:18 他们分我的外衣、为我的里衣拈阄。  
22:19 耶和华阿、求你不要远离我。我的救主阿、求你快来帮助我。  
22:20 求你救我的灵魂脱离刀剑、救我的生命脱离犬类、〔生命原文作独一者〕  

22:21 救我脱离狮子的口。你已经应允我、使我脱离野牛的角。  
22:22 我要将你的名传与我的弟兄。在会中我要赞美你。  
22:23 你们敬畏耶和华的人、要赞美他。雅各的后裔、都要荣耀他。以色列的后裔、都要惧怕他。  
22:24 因为他没有藐视憎恶受苦的人。也没有向他掩面。那受苦之人呼吁的时候、他就垂听。  
22:25 我在大会中赞美你的话、是从你而来的。我要在敬畏耶和华的人面前还我的愿。  

22:26 谦卑的人必吃得饱足。寻求耶和华的人必赞美他。愿你们的心永远活着。  
22:27 地的四极都要想念耶和华、并且归顺他。列国的万族、都要在你面前敬拜。  
22:28 因为国权是耶和华的。他是管理万国的。  
22:29 地上一切丰肥的人、必吃喝而敬拜。凡下到尘土中不能存活自己性命的人、都要在他面前下拜。  
22:30 他必有后裔事奉他。主所行的事必传与后代。  

22:31 他们必来把他的公义传给将要生的民、言明这事是他所行的。

诗篇 23章  

23:1 〔大卫的诗。〕耶和华是我的牧者。我必不至缺乏。  
23:2 他使我躺卧在青草地上、领我在可安歇的水边。  
23:3 他使我的灵魂苏醒、为自己的名引导我走义路。  
23:4 我虽然行过死荫的幽谷、也不怕遭害。因为你与我同在。你的杖、你的竿、都安慰我。  
23:5 在我敌人面前、你为我摆设筵席。你用油膏了我的头、使我的福杯满溢。  

23:6 我一生一世必有恩惠慈爱随着我。我且要住在耶和华的殿中、直到永远。

诗篇 24章   

24:1 〔大卫的诗。〕地和其中所充满的、世界、和住在其间的、都属耶和华。  
24:2 他把地建立在海上、安定在大水之上。  
24:3 谁能登耶和华的山。谁能站在他的圣所。  
24:4 就是手洁心清、不向虚妄、起誓不怀诡诈的人。  
24:5 他必蒙耶和华赐福、又蒙救他的　神使他成义。  

24:6 这是寻求耶和华的族类、是寻求你面的雅各。〔细拉〕  
24:7 众城门哪、你们要抬起头来。永久的门户、你们要被举起。那荣耀的王将要进来。  
24:8 荣耀的王是谁呢。就是有力有能的耶和华、在战场上有能的耶和华。  
24:9 众城门哪、你们要抬起头来。永久的门户、你们要把头抬起。那荣耀的王将要进来。  
24:10 荣耀的王是谁呢。万军之耶和华、他是荣耀的王。〔细拉〕

诗篇 27章   

27:1 〔大卫的诗。〕耶和华是我的亮光、是我的拯救。我还怕谁呢。耶和华是我性命的保障。〔保障或作力量〕我还惧谁呢。  
27:2 那作恶的、就是我的仇敌、前来吃我肉的时候、就绊跌仆倒。  
27:3 虽有军兵安营攻击我、我的心也不害怕。虽然兴起刀兵攻击我、我必仍旧安稳。  
27:4 有一件事、我曾求耶和华、我仍要寻求。就是一生一世住在耶和华的殿中、瞻仰他的荣美、在他的殿里求问。  
27:5 因为我遭遇患难、他必暗暗地保守我。在他亭子里、把我藏在他帐幕的隐密处、将我高举在磐石上。  

27:6 现在我得以昂首、高过四面的仇敌。我要在他的帐幕里欢然献祭。我要唱诗、歌颂耶和华。  
27:7 耶和华阿、我用声音呼吁的时候、求你垂听。并求你怜恤我、应允我。  
27:8 你说、你们当寻求我的面。那时我心向你说、耶和华阿、你的面我正要寻求。  
27:9 不要向我掩面。不要发怒赶逐仆人。你向来是帮助我的。救我的　神阿、不要丢掉我、也不要离弃我。

27:11 耶和华阿、求你将你的道指教我、因我仇敌的缘故引导我走平坦的路。  
27:12 求你不要把我交给敌人、遂其所愿。因为妄作见证的、和口吐凶言的、起来攻击我。  
27:13 我若不信在活人之地得见耶和华的恩惠、就早已丧胆了。

------------------------------------------

诗篇 28章   

28:1 〔大卫的诗。〕耶和华阿、我要求告你。我的磐石阿、不要向我缄默。倘若你向我闭口、我就如将死的人一样。  
28:2 我呼求你、向你至圣所举手的时候、求你垂听我恳求的声音。  
28:3 不要把我和恶人、并作孽的、一同除掉。他们与邻舍说和平话、心里却是奸恶。  
28:4 愿你按着他们所作的、并他们所行的恶事待他们。愿你照着他们手所作的待他们。将他们所应得的报应加给他们。  
28:5 他们既然不留心耶和华所行的、和他手所作的、他就必毁坏他们、不建立他们。  

28:6 耶和华是应当称颂的、因为他听了我恳求的声音。

29:2 要将耶和华的名所当得的荣耀归给他。以圣洁的妆饰〔的或作为〕敬拜耶和华。  
29:3 耶和华的声音发在水上。荣耀的　神打雷、耶和华打雷在大水之上。  
29:4 耶和华的声音大有能力。耶和华的声音满有威严。  
29:5 耶和华的声音震破香柏树。耶和华震碎利巴嫩的香柏树。  

29:6 他也使之跳跃如牛犊、使利巴嫩和西连跳跃如野牛犊。  
29:7 耶和华的声音使火焰分岔。  
29:8 耶和华的声音震动旷野。耶和华震动加低斯的旷野。

诗篇 30章   

30:1 〔大卫在献殿的时候、作这诗歌。〕耶和华阿、我要尊崇你、因为你曾提拔我、不叫仇敌向我夸耀。  
30:2 耶和华我的　神阿、我曾呼求你、你医治了我。  
30:3 耶和华阿、你曾把我的灵魂从阴间救上来、使我存活、不至于下坑。  
30:4 耶和华的圣民哪、你们要歌颂他、称赞他可记念的圣名
30:5 因为他的怒气不过是转眼之间。他的恩典乃是一生之久。一宿虽然有哭泣、早晨便必欢呼。  

30:6 至于我、我凡事平顺、便说、我永不动摇。  
30:7 耶和华阿、你曾施恩、叫我的江山稳固。你掩了面、我就惊惶。  
30:8 耶和华阿、我曾求告你。我向耶和华恳求、说、  
30:9 我被害流血、下到坑中、有甚么益处呢。尘土岂能称赞你、传说你的诚实么。  
30:10 耶和华阿、求你应允我、怜恤我。耶和华阿、求你帮助我。  

30:11 你已将我的哀哭变为跳舞、将我的麻衣脱去、给我披上喜乐。  
30:12 好叫我的灵〔原文作荣耀〕歌颂你、并不住声。耶和华我的　神阿、我要称谢你、直到永远。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 31章     

31:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕耶和华阿、我投靠你。求你使我永不羞愧、凭你的公义搭救我。  
31:2 求你侧耳而听、快快救我、作我坚固的磐石、拯救我的保障。  
31:3 因为你是我的岩石、我的山寨。所以求你为你名的缘故、引导我、指点我。  
31:4 求你救我脱离人为我暗设的网罗。因为你是我的保障。  
31:5 我将我的灵魂交在你手里。耶和华诚实的　神阿、你救赎了我。  

31:6 我恨恶那信奉虚无之神的人。我却倚靠耶和华。  
31:7 我要为你的慈爱高兴欢喜。因为你见过我的困苦、知道我心中的艰难。  
31:8 你未曾把我交在仇敌手里。你使我的脚站在宽阔之处。  
31:9 耶和华阿、求你怜恤我、因为我在急难之中。我的眼睛因忧愁而干瘪、连我的身心、也不安舒。  
31:10 我的生命为愁苦所消耗。我的年岁为叹息所旷废。我的力量因我的罪孽衰败。我的骨头也枯干。  

31:11 我因一切敌人成了羞辱、在我的邻舍跟前更甚。那认识我的都惧怕我。在外头看见我的都躲避我。  
31:12 我被人忘记、如同死人、无人记念。我好像破碎的器皿。  
31:13 我听见了许多人的谗谤、四围都是惊吓。他们一同商议攻击我的时候、就图谋要害我的性命。  
31:14 耶和华阿、我仍旧倚靠你。我说、你是我的　神。  
31:15 我终身的事在你手中。求你救我脱离仇敌的手、和那些逼迫我的人。  

31:16 求你使你的脸光照仆人、凭你的慈爱拯救我。  
31:17 耶和华阿、求你叫我不至羞愧。因为我曾呼吁你。求你使恶人羞愧、使他们在阴间缄默无声。  
31:18 那撒谎的人、逞骄傲轻慢、出狂妄的话攻击义人。愿他的嘴哑而无言。  
31:19 敬畏你投靠你的人、你为他们所积存的、在世人面前所施行的恩惠、是何等大呢。  
31:20 你必把他们藏在你面前的隐密处、免得遇见人的计谋。你必暗暗地保守他们在亭子里、免受口舌的争闹。  

31:21 耶和华是应当称颂的。因为他在坚固城里、向我施展奇妙的慈爱。  
31:22 至于我、我曾急促的说、我从你眼前被隔绝。然而、我呼求你的时候、你仍听我恳求的声音。  
31:23 耶和华的圣民哪、你们都要爱他。耶和华保护诚实人、足足报应行事骄傲的人。  
31:24 凡仰望耶和华的人、你们都要壮胆、坚固你们的心。

诗篇 32章   

32:1 〔大卫的训诲诗。〕得赦免其过、遮盖其罪的、这人是有福的。  
32:2 凡心里没有诡诈、耶和华不算为有罪的、这人是有福的。  
32:3 我闭口不认罪的时候、因终日唉哼、而骨头枯干。  
32:4 黑夜白日、你的手在我身上沉重。我的精液耗尽、如同夏天的干旱。〔细拉〕  
32:5 我向你陈明我的罪、不隐瞒我的恶。我说、我要向耶和华承认我的过犯、你就赦免我的罪恶。〔细拉〕  

32:6 为此、凡虔诚人、都当趁你可寻找的时候祷告你。大水泛溢的时候、必不能到他那里。  
32:7 你是我藏身之处。你必保佑我脱离苦难、以得救的乐歌、四面环绕我。〔细拉〕  
32:8 我要教导你、指示你当行的路。我要定睛在你身上劝戒你。  
32:9 你不可像那无知的骡马、必用嚼环辔头勒住他。不然、就不能驯服。  
32:10 恶人必多受苦楚。惟独倚靠耶和华的、必有慈爱四面环绕他。  

32:11 你们义人应当靠耶和华欢喜快乐。你们心里正直的人、都当欢呼。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 33章     

33:1 义人哪、你们应当靠耶和华欢乐。正直人的赞美是合宜的。  
33:2 你们应当弹琴称谢耶和华、用十弦瑟歌颂他。  
33:3 应当向他唱新歌、弹得巧妙、声音洪亮。  
33:4 因为耶和华的言语正直。凡他所作的、尽都诚实。  
33:5 他喜爱仁义公平。遍地满了耶和华的慈爱。  

33:6 诸天借耶和华的命而造、万象借他口中的气而成。  
33:7 他聚集海水如垒、收藏深洋在库房。  
33:8 愿全地都敬畏耶和华。愿世上的居民、都惧怕他。  
33:9 因为他说有、就有。命立、就立。  
33:10 耶和华使列国的筹算归于无有、使众民的思念无有功效。  

33:11 耶和华的筹算永远立定、他心中的思念万代常存。  
33:12 以耶和华为　神的、那国是有福的。他所拣选为自己产业的、那民是有福的。  
33:13 耶和华从天上观看。他看见一切的世人。  
33:14 从他的居所、往外察看地上一切的居民。  
33:15 他是那造成他们众人心的、留意他们一切作为的。  

33:16 君王不能因兵多得胜。勇士不能因力大得救。  
33:17 靠马得救是枉然的。马也不能因力大救人。  
33:18 耶和华的眼目、看顾敬畏他的人、和仰望他慈爱的人、  
33:19 要救他们的命脱离死亡、并使他们在饥荒中存活。  
33:20 我们的心向来等候耶和华。他是我们的帮助、我们的盾牌。  

33:21 我们的心必靠他欢喜、因为我们向来倚靠他的圣名。  
33:22 耶和华阿、求你照着我们所仰望你的、向我们施行慈爱。

34:3 你们和我当称耶和华为大、一同高举他的名。

34:11 众弟子阿、你们当来听我的话。我要将敬畏耶和华的道、教训你们。  
34:12 有何人喜好存活、爱慕长寿、得享美福。  
34:13 就要禁止舌头不出恶言、嘴唇不说诡诈的话。  
34:14 要离恶行善、寻求和睦、一心追赶。  
34:15 耶和华的眼目、看顾义人、他的耳朵、听他们的呼求。  

34:16 耶和华向行恶的人变脸、要从世上除灭他们的名号。  
34:17 义人呼求、耶和华听见了、便救他们脱离一切患难。

诗篇 35章      

35:1 〔大卫的诗。〕耶和华阿、与我相争的、求你与他们相争。与我相战的、求你与他们相战。  
35:2 拿着大小的盾牌、起来帮助我。  
35:3 抽出枪来、挡住那追赶我的。求你对我的灵魂说、我是拯救你的。  
35:4 愿那寻索我命的、蒙羞受辱。愿那谋害我的、退后羞愧。  
35:5 愿他们像风前的糠、有耶和华的使者赶逐他们。  

35:6 愿他们的道路、又暗又滑、有耶和华的使者追赶他们。  
35:7 因他们无故地为我暗设网罗。无故的挖坑、要害我的性命。  
35:8 愿灾祸忽然临到他身上。愿他暗设的网缠住自己。愿他落在其中遭灾祸。  
35:9 我的心必靠耶和华快乐、靠他的救恩高兴。  
35:10 我的骨头都要说、耶和华阿、谁能像你救护困苦人、脱离那比他强壮的、救护困苦穷乏人、脱离那抢夺他的。  

35:11 凶恶的见证人起来、盘问我所不知道的事。  
35:12 他们向我以恶报善、使我的灵魂孤苦。  
35:13 至于我、当他们有病的时候、我便穿麻衣、禁食刻苦己心。我所求的都归到自己的怀中。  
35:14 我这样行、好像他是我的朋友、我的弟兄。我屈身悲哀、如同人为母亲哀痛。  
35:15 我在患难中、他们却欢喜、大家聚集。我所不认识的那些下流人、聚集攻击我。他们不住地把我撕裂。  

35:16 他们如同席上好嬉笑的狂妄人、向我咬牙。  
35:17 主阿、你看着不理、要到几时呢。求你救我的灵魂、脱离他们的残害、救我的生命、脱离少壮狮子。〔生命原文作独一者〕  
35:18 我在大会中要称谢你、在众民中要赞美你。  
35:19 求你不容那无理与我为仇的、向我夸耀。不容那无故恨我的、向我挤眼。  
35:20 因为他们不说和平话。倒想出诡诈的言语、害地上的安静人。  

35:21 他们大大张口攻击我、说、阿哈、阿哈、我们的眼已经看见了。  
35:22 耶和华阿、你已经看见了。求你不要闭口。主阿、求你不要远离我。  
35:23 我的　神我的主阿、求你奋兴醒起、判清我的事、伸明我的冤。  
35:24 耶和华我的　神阿、求你按你的公义判断我、不容他们向我夸耀。  
35:25 不容他们心里说、阿哈、遂我们的心愿了。不容他们说、我们已经把他吞了。  

35:26 愿那喜欢我遭难的、一同抱愧蒙羞。愿那向我妄自尊大的、披惭愧、蒙羞辱。  
35:27 愿那喜悦我冤屈得伸的、〔冤屈得伸原文作公义〕欢呼快乐。愿他们常说、当尊耶和华为大。耶和华喜悦他的仆人平安。  
35:28 我的舌头、要终日论说你的公义、时常赞美你。

诗篇 36章   

36:1 〔耶和华的仆人大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕恶人的罪过、在他心里说、我眼中不怕　神。  
36:2 他自夸自媚、以为他的罪孽终不显露、不被恨恶。  
36:3 他口中的言语、尽是罪孽诡诈。他与智慧善行、已经断绝。  
36:4 他在床上图谋罪孽、定意行不善的道、不憎恶恶事。  
36:5 耶和华阿、你的慈爱、上及诸天。你的信实、达到穹苍。  

36:6 你的公义、好像高山。你的判断、如同深渊。耶和华阿、人民牲畜、你都救护。  
36:7 　神阿、你的慈爱、何其宝贵。世人投靠在你翅膀的荫下。  
36:8 他们必因你殿里的肥甘、得以饱足。你也必叫他们喝你乐河的水。  
36:9 因为在你那里、有生命的源头。在你的光中、我们必得见光。  
36:10 愿你常施慈爱给认识你的人。常以公义待心里正直的人。  

36:11 不容骄傲人的脚践踏我、不容凶恶人的手赶逐我。  
36:12 在那里作孽的人、已经仆倒。他们被推倒、不能再起来。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 37章       

37:1 〔大卫的诗。〕不要为作恶的、心怀不平、也不要向那行不义的、生出嫉妒。  
37:2 因为他们如草快被割下、又如青菜快要枯干。  
37:3 你当倚靠耶和华而行善。住在地上、以他的信实为粮。  
37:4 又要以耶和华为乐。他就将你心里所求的赐给你。  
37:5 当将你的事交托耶和华、并倚靠他、他就必成全。  

37:6 他要使你的公义、如光发出、使你的公平、明如正午。  
37:7 你当默然倚靠耶和华、耐性等候他。不要因那道路通达的、和那恶谋成就的、心怀不平。  
37:8 当止住怒气、离弃忿怒。不要心怀不平、以致作恶。  
37:9 因为作恶的、必被剪除。惟有等候耶和华的、必承受地土。  
37:10 还有片时、恶人要归于无有。你就是细察他的住处、也要归于无有。  

37:11 但谦卑人必承受地土、以丰盛的平安为乐。  
37:12 恶人设谋害义人、又向他咬牙。  
37:13 主要笑他、因见他受罚的日子将要来到。  
37:14 恶人已经弓上弦、刀出鞘、要打倒困苦穷乏的人、要杀害行动正直的人。  
37:15 他们的刀、必刺入自己的心、他们的弓、必被折断。  

37:16 一个义人所有的虽少、强过许多恶人的富余。  
37:17 因为恶人的膀臂、必被折断。但耶和华是扶持义人。  
37:18 耶和华知道完全人的日子。他们的产业、要存到永远。  
37:19 他们在急难的时候、不至羞愧、在饥荒的日子、必得饱足。  
37:20 恶人却要灭亡。耶和华的仇敌、要像羊羔的脂油。〔或作像草地的华美〕他们要消灭、要如烟消灭。  

37:21 恶人借贷而不偿还。义人却恩待人、并且施舍。  
37:22 蒙耶和华赐福的、必承受地土。被他咒诅的、必被剪除。  
37:23 义人的脚步、被耶和华立定。他的道路、耶和华也喜爱。  
37:24 他虽失脚、也不至全身仆倒。因为耶和华用手搀扶他。〔或作搀扶他的手〕  
37:25 我从前年幼、现在年老、却未见过义人被弃。也未见过他的后裔讨饭。  

37:26 他终日恩待人、借给人。他的后裔也蒙福。  
37:27 你当离恶行善、就可永远安居。  
37:28 因为耶和华喜爱公平、不撇弃他的圣民。他们永蒙保佑。但恶人的后裔必被剪除。  
37:29 义人必承受地土、永居其上。  
37:30 义人的口谈论智慧、他的舌头讲说公平。  

37:31 　神的律法在他心里。他的脚总不滑跌。  
37:32 恶人窥探义人、想要杀他。  
37:33 耶和华必不撇他在恶人手中、当审判的时候、也不定他的罪。  
37:34 你当等候耶和华、遵守他的道、他就抬举你、使你承受地土。恶人被剪除的时候、你必看见。  
37:35 我见过恶人大有势力、好像一根青翠树在本土生发。  

37:36 有人从那里经过、不料、他没有了。我也寻找他、却寻不着。  
37:37 你要细察那完全人、观看那正直人。因为和平人有好结局。  
37:38 至于犯法的人、必一同灭绝。恶人终必剪除。  
37:39 但义人得救、是由于耶和华。他在患难时作他们的营寨。  
37:40 耶和华帮助他们、解救他们。他解救他们脱离恶人、把他们救出来、因为他们投靠他。

诗篇 38章     

38:1 〔大卫的记念诗。〕耶和华阿、求你不要在怒中责备我。不要在烈怒中惩罚我。  
38:2 因为你的箭射入我身、你的手压住我。  
38:3 因你的恼怒、我的肉无一完全。因我的罪过、我的骨头也不安宁。  
38:4 我的罪孽高过我的头、如同重担叫我担当不起。  
38:5 因我的愚昧、我的伤发臭流脓。  

38:6 我疼痛、大大拳曲、终日哀痛。  
38:7 我满腰是火。我的肉无一完全。  
38:8 我被压伤、身体疲倦。因心里不安、我就唉哼。  
38:9 主阿、我的心愿都在你面前。我的叹息不向你隐瞒。  
38:10 我心跳动、我力衰微、连我眼中的光、也没有了。  

38:11 我的良朋密友、因我的灾病、都躲在旁边站着。我的亲戚本家、也远远的站立。  
38:12 那寻索我命的、设下网罗。那想要害我的、口出恶言、终日思想诡计。  
38:13 但我如聋子不听、像哑巴不开口。  
38:14 我如不听见的人、口中没有回话。  
38:15 耶和华阿、我仰望你。主我的　神阿、你必应允我。  

38:16 我曾说、恐怕他们向我夸耀。我失脚的时候、他们向我夸大。  
38:17 我几乎跌倒。我的痛苦常在我面前。  
38:18 我要承认我的罪孽。我要因我的罪忧愁。  
38:19 但我的仇敌又活泼又强壮。无理恨我的增多了。  
38:20 以恶报善的与我作对、因我是追求良善。  

38:21 耶和华阿、求你不要撇弃我。我的　神阿、求你不要远离我。  
38:22 拯救我的主阿、求你快快帮助我。

诗篇 39章    

39:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长耶杜顿。〕我曾说、我要谨慎我的言行、免得我舌头犯罪。恶人在我面前的时候、我要用嚼环勒住我的口。  
39:2 我默然无声、连好话也不出口。我的愁苦就发动了。  
39:3 我的心在我里面发热。我默想的时候、火就烧起、我便用舌头说话。  
39:4 耶和华阿、求你叫我晓得我身之终、我的寿数几何、叫我知道我的生命不长。  
39:5 你使我的年日、窄如手掌。我一生的年数、在你面前、如同无有。各人最稳妥的时候、真是全然虚幻。〔细拉〕  

39:6 世人行动实系幻影。他们忙乱、真是枉然。积蓄财宝、不知将来有谁收取。  
39:7 主阿、如今我等甚么呢。我的指望在乎你。  
39:8 求你救我脱离一切的过犯。不要使我受愚顽人的羞辱。  
39:9 因我所遭遇的是出于你、我就默然不语。  
39:10 求你把你的责罚从我身上免去。因你手的责打、我便消灭。  

39:11 你因人的罪恶、惩罚他的时候、叫他的笑容消灭、〔的笑容或作所喜爱的〕如衣被虫所咬。世人真是虚幻。〔细拉〕  
39:12 耶和华阿。求你听我的祷告、留心听我的呼求。我流泪、求你不要静默无声。因为我在你面前是客旅、是寄居的、像我列祖一般。  
39:13 求你宽容我、使我在去而不返之先、可以力量复原。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 40章     

40:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕我曾耐性等候耶和华。他垂听我的呼求。  
40:2 他从祸坑里、从淤泥中、把我拉上来、使我的脚立在磐石上、使我脚步稳当。  
40:3 他使我口唱新歌、就是赞美我们　神的话。许多人必看见而惧怕、并要倚靠耶和华。  
40:4 那倚靠耶和华、不理会狂傲和偏向虚假之辈的、这人便为有福。  
40:5 耶和华我的　神阿、你所行的奇事、并你向我们所怀的意念甚多、不能向你陈明。若要陈明、其事不可胜数。  

40:6 祭物和礼物、你不喜悦。你已经开通我的耳朵。燔祭和赎罪祭、非你所要。  
40:7 那时我说、看哪、我来了。我的事在经卷上已经记载了。  
40:8 我的　神阿、我乐意照你的旨意行。你的律法在我心里。  
40:9 我在大会中宣传公义的佳音。我必不止住我的嘴唇。耶和华阿、这是你所知道的。  
40:10 我未曾把你的公义藏在心里。我已陈明你的信实、和你的救恩。我在大会中未曾隐瞒你的慈爱、和诚实。  

40:11 耶和华阿、求你不要向我止住你的慈悲。愿你的慈爱和诚实、常常保佑我。  
40:12 因有无数的祸患围困我。我的罪孽追上了我、使我不能昂首。这罪孽比我的头发还多。我就心寒胆战。  
40:13 耶和华阿、求你开恩搭救我。耶和华阿、求你速速帮助我。  
40:14 愿那些寻找我、要灭我命的、一同抱愧蒙羞。愿那些喜悦我受害的、退后受辱。  
40:15 愿那些对我说、阿哈、阿哈的、因羞愧而败亡。  

40:16 愿一切寻求你的、因你高兴欢喜。愿那些喜爱你救恩的、常说、当尊耶和华为大。  
40:17 但我是困苦穷乏的、主仍顾念我。你是帮助我的、搭救我的。　神阿、求你不要耽延。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 41章    

41:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕眷顾贫穷的有福了。他遭难的日子、耶和华必搭救他。  
41:2 耶和华必保全他、使他存活。他必在地上享福。求你不要把他交给仇敌、遂其所愿。  
41:3 他病重在榻、耶和华必扶持他。他在病中、你必给他铺床。  
41:4 我曾说、耶和华阿、求你怜恤我、医治我。因为我得罪了你。  
41:5 我的仇敌用恶言议论我、说、他几时死、他的名才灭亡呢。  

41:6 他来看我、就说假话。他心存奸恶、走到外边才说出来。  
41:7 一切恨我的、都交头接耳地议论我。他们设计要害我。  
41:8 他们说、有怪病贴在他身上。他已躺卧、必不能再起来。  
41:9 连我知己的朋友、我所倚靠、吃过我饭的、也用脚踢我。  
41:10 耶和华阿、求你怜恤我、使我起来、好报复他们。  

41:11 因我的仇敌不得向我夸胜。我从此便知道你喜爱我。  
41:12 你因我纯正、就扶持我、使我永远站在你的面前。  
41:13 耶和华以色列的　神、是应当称颂的、从亘古直到永远。阿们、阿们。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 42章   

42:1 〔可拉后裔的训诲诗、交与伶长。〕　神阿、我的心切慕你、如鹿切慕溪水。  
42:2 我的心渴想　神、就是永生　神。我几时得朝见　神呢。  
42:3 我昼夜以眼泪当饮食。人不住地对我说、你的　神在哪里呢。  
42:4 我从前与众人同往、用欢呼称赞的声音、领他们到　神的殿里、大家守节。我追想这些事、我的心极其悲伤。  
42:5 我的心哪、你为何忧闷、为何在我里面烦躁。应当仰望　神。因他笑脸帮助我、我还要称赞他。  

42:6 我的　神阿、我的心在我里面忧闷。所以我从约但地、从黑门岭、从米萨山、记念你。  
42:7 你的瀑布发声、深渊就与深渊响应。你的波浪洪涛漫过我身。  
42:8 白昼耶和华必向我施慈爱。黑夜我要歌颂祷告赐我生命的　神。  
42:9 我要对　神我的磐石说、你为何忘记我呢。我为何因仇敌的欺压时常哀痛呢。  
42:10 我的敌人辱骂我、好像打碎我的骨头、不住的对我说、你的　神在哪里呢。  

42:11 我的心哪、你为何忧闷、为何在我里面烦躁。应当仰望　神。因我还要称赞他。他是我脸上的光荣、〔原文作帮助〕是我的　神。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 43章   

43:1 　神阿、求你伸我的冤、向不虔诚的国、为我辨屈。求你救我脱离诡诈不义的人。  
43:2 因为你是赐我力量的　神、为何丢弃我呢。我为何因仇敌的欺压时常哀痛呢。  
43:3 求你发出你的亮光和真实、好引导我、带我到你的圣山、到你的居所。  
43:4 我就走到　神的祭坛、到我最喜乐的　神那里。　神阿、我的　神、我要弹琴称赞你。  
43:5 我的心哪、你为何忧闷、为何在我里面烦躁。应当仰望　神。因我还要称赞他。他是我脸上的光荣、〔原文作帮助〕是我的　神。  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 44章      

44:1 〔可拉后裔的训诲诗、交与伶长。〕　神阿、你在古时、我们列祖的日子、所行的事、我们亲耳听见了、我们的列祖、也给我们述说过。  
44:2 你曾用手赶出外邦人、却栽培了我们列祖。你苦待列邦、却叫我们列祖发达。  
44:3 因为他们不是靠自己的刀剑得地土、也不是靠自己的膀臂得胜。乃是靠你的右手、你的膀臂、和你脸上的亮光、因为你喜悦他们。  
44:4 　神阿、你是我的王、求你出令、使雅各得胜。  
44:5 我们靠你要推倒我们的敌人。靠你的名要践踏那起来攻击我们的人。  

44:6 因为我必不靠我的弓、我的刀也不能使我得胜。  
44:7 惟你救了我们脱离敌人、使恨我们的人羞愧。  
44:8 我们终日因　神夸耀、还要永远称谢你的名。〔细拉〕  
44:9 但如今你丢弃了我们、使我们受辱、不和我们的军兵同去。  
44:10 你使我们向敌人转身退后。那恨我们的人任意抢夺。  

44:11 你使我们当作快要被吃的羊、把我们分散在列邦中。  
44:12 你卖了你的子民也不赚利。所得的价值、并不加添你的资财。  
44:13 你使我们受邻国的羞辱被四围的人嗤笑讥刺。  
44:14 你使我们在列邦中作了笑谈、使众民向我们摇头。  
44:15 我的凌辱、终日在我面前我脸上的羞愧、将我遮蔽。  

44:16 都因那辱骂毁谤人的声音、又因仇敌和报仇人的缘故。  
44:17 这都临到我们身上。我们却没有忘记你、也没有违背你的约。  
44:18 我们的心没有退后、我们的脚也没有偏离你的路。  
44:19 你在野狗之处压伤我们、用死荫遮蔽我们。  
44:20 倘若我们忘了　神的名、或向别神举手、  

44:21 　神岂不鉴察这事么。因为他晓得人心里的隐秘。  
44:22 我们为你的缘故终日被杀、人看我们如将宰的羊。  
44:23 主阿、求你睡醒、为何尽睡呢。求你兴起、不要永远丢弃我们。  
44:24 你为何掩面、不顾我们所遭的苦难、和所受的欺压。  
44:25 我们的性命伏于尘土。我们的肚腹紧贴地面。  

44:26 求你起来帮助我们、凭你的慈爱救赎我们。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 45章   

45:1 〔可拉后裔的训诲诗、又是爱慕歌、交与伶长、调用百合花。〕我心里涌出美辞。我论到我为王作的事。我的舌头是快手笔。  
45:2 你比世人更美、在你嘴里满有恩惠。所以　神赐福给你、直到永远。  
45:3 大能者阿、愿你腰间佩刀、大有荣耀和威严。  
45:4 为真理、谦卑、公义、赫然坐车前往、无不得胜。你的右手必显明可畏的事。  
45:5 你的箭锋快、射中王敌之心。万民仆倒在你以下。  

45:6 　神阿、你的宝座是永永远远的。你的国权是正直的。  
45:7 你喜爱公义、恨恶罪恶。所以　神、就是你的　神、用喜乐油膏你、胜过膏你的同伴。  
45:8 你的衣服、都有没药沉香肉桂的香气。象牙宫中有丝弦乐器的声音、使你欢喜。  
45:9 有君王的女儿、在你尊贵妇女之中。王后佩戴俄斐金饰、站在你右边。  
45:10 女子阿、你要听、要想、要侧耳而听。不要记念你的民、和你的父家。  

45:11 王就羡慕你的美貌。因为他是你的主。你当敬拜他。  
45:12 推罗的民、〔民原文作女子〕必来送礼。民中的富足人、也必向你求恩。  
45:13 王女在宫里、极其荣华。他的衣服是用金线绣的。  
45:14 他要穿锦绣的衣服、被引到王前。随从他的陪伴童女、也要被带到你面前。  
45:15 他们要欢喜快乐被引导。他们要进入王宫。  

45:16 你的子孙要接续你的列祖。你要立他们在全地作王。  
45:17 我必叫你的名被万代记念。所以万民要永永远远称谢你。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 46章   

46:1 〔可拉后裔的诗歌、交与伶长、调用女音。〕　神是我们的避难所、是我们的力量、是我们在患难中随时的帮助。  
46:2 所以地虽改变、山虽摇动到海心、  
46:3 其中的水虽匉訇翻腾、山虽因海涨而战抖、我们也不害怕。〔细拉〕  
46:4 有一道河。这河的分汊、使　神的城欢喜。这城就是至高者居住的圣所。  
46:5 　神在其中。城必不动摇。到天一亮、　神必帮助这城。  

46:6 外邦喧嚷、列国动摇。　神发声、地便熔化。  
46:7 万军之耶和华与我们同在。雅各的　神是我们的避难所。〔细拉〕  
46:8 你们来看耶和华的作为、看他使地怎样荒凉。  
46:9 他止息刀兵、直到地极。他折弓、断枪、把战车焚烧在火中。  
46:10 你们要休息、要知道我是　神。我必在外邦中被尊崇、在遍地上也被尊崇。  

46:11 万军之耶和华与我们同在。雅各的　神是我们的避难所。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 47章   

47:1 〔可拉后裔的诗、交与伶长。〕万民哪、你们都要拍掌。要用夸胜的声音向　神呼喊。  
47:2 因为耶和华至高者是可畏的。他是治理全地的大君王。  
47:3 他叫万民服在我们以下、又叫列邦服在我们脚下。  
47:4 他为我们选择产业、就是他所爱之雅各的荣耀。〔细拉〕  
47:5 　神上升、有喊声相送。耶和华上升、有角声相送。  

47:6 你们要向　神歌颂、歌颂、向我们王歌颂、歌颂。  
47:7 因为　神是全地的王。你们要用悟性歌颂。  
47:8 　神作王治理万国。　神坐在他的圣宝座上。  
47:9 列邦的君王聚集、要作亚伯拉罕之　神的民。因为世界的盾牌、是属　神的。他为至高。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 48章   

48:1 〔可拉后裔的诗歌。〕耶和华本为大、在我们　神的城中、在他的圣山上、该受大赞美。  
48:2 锡安山、大君王的城、在北面居高华美、为全地所喜悦。  
48:3 　神在其宫中自显为避难所。  
48:4 看哪、众王会合、一同经过。  
48:5 他们见了这城、就惊奇丧胆、急忙逃跑。  

48:6 他们在那里被战兢疼痛抓住、好像产难的妇人一样。  
48:7 　神阿、你用东风打破他施的船只。  
48:8 我们在万军之耶和华的城中、就是我们　神的城中、所看见的、正如我们所听见的。　神必坚立这城、直到永远。〔细拉〕  
48:9 　神阿、我们在你的殿中、想念你的慈爱。  
48:10 　神阿、你受的赞美、正与你的名相称、直到地极。你的右手满了公义。  

48:11 因你的判断、锡安山应当欢喜犹大的城邑、应当快乐。〔城邑原文作女子〕  
48:12 你们当周游锡安、四围旋绕、数点城楼、  
48:13 细看他的外郭、察看他的宫殿、为要传说到后代。  
48:14 因为这　神永永远远为我们的　神。他必作我们引路的、直到死时。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 49章    

49:1 〔可拉后裔的诗、交与伶长。〕万民哪、你们都当听这话、世上一切的居民、  
49:2 无论上流下流、富足贫穷、都当留心听。  
49:3 我口要说智慧的言语。我心要想通达的道理。  
49:4 我要侧耳听比喻、用琴解谜语。  
49:5 在患难的日子、奸恶随我脚跟、四面环绕我、我何必惧怕。  

49:6 那些倚仗财货自夸钱财多的人、  
49:7 一个也无法赎自己的弟兄、也不能替他将赎价给　神、  
49:8 叫他长远活着、不见朽坏。因为赎他生命的价值极贵、只可永远罢休。  
49:9 见上节
49:10 他必见智慧人死。又见愚顽人和畜类人、一同灭亡、将他们的财货留给别人。  

49:11 他们心里思想、他们的家室必永存、住宅必留到万代。他们以自己的名、称自己的地。  
49:12 但人居尊贵中不能长久、如同死亡的畜类一样。  
49:13 他们行的这道、本为自己的愚昧。但他们以后的人、还佩服他们的话语。〔细拉〕  
49:14 他们如同羊群派定下阴间。死亡必作他们的牧者。到了早晨、正直人必管辖他们。他们的美容、必被阴间所灭、以致无处可存。  
49:15 只是　神必救赎我的灵魂、脱离阴间的权柄、因他必收纳我。〔细拉〕  

49:16 见人发财家室增荣的时候、你不要惧怕。  
49:17 因为他死的时候、甚么也不能带去。他的荣耀不能随他下去。  
49:18 他活着的时候、虽然自夸为有福、（你若利己、人必夸奖你)
49:19 他仍必归到他历代的祖宗那里、永不见光。  
49:20 人在尊贵中、而不醒悟、就如死亡的畜类一样。

诗篇 50章     

50:1 〔亚萨的诗。〕大能者　神耶和华、已经发言招呼天下、从日出之地到日落之处。  
50:2 从全美的锡安中、　神已经发光了。  
50:3 我们的　神要来、决不闭口。有烈火在他面前吞灭、有暴风在他四围大刮。  
50:4 他招呼上天下地、为要审判他的民、  
50:5 说、招聚我的圣民到我这里来、就是那些用祭物与我立约的人。  

50:6 诸天必表明他的公义。因为　神是施行审判的。〔细拉〕  
50:7 我的民哪、你们当听我的话。以色列阿、我要劝戒你。我是　神、是你的　神。  
50:8 我并不因你的祭物责备你。你的燔祭常在我面前。  
50:9 我不从你家中取公牛、也不从你圈内取山羊。  
50:10 因为树林中的百兽是我的、千山上的牲畜也是我的。  

50:11 山中的飞鸟、我都知道。野地的走兽、也都属我。  
50:12 我若是饥饿、我不用告诉你。因为世界、和其中所充满的、都是我的。  
50:13 我岂吃公牛的肉呢。我岂喝山羊的血呢。  
50:14 你们要以感谢为祭献与　神。又要向至高者还你的愿。  
50:15 并要在患难之日求告我、我必搭救你。你也要荣耀我。  

50:16 但　神对恶人说、你怎敢传说我的律例、口中提到我的约呢。  
50:17 其实你恨恶管教、将我的言语丢在背后。  
50:18 你见了盗贼、就乐意与他同伙、又与行奸淫的人、一同有分。  
50:19 你口任说恶言、你舌编造诡诈。  
50:20 你坐着毁谤你的兄弟、谗毁你亲母的儿子。  

50:21 你行了这些事、我还闭口不言。你想我恰和你一样。其实我要责备你、将这些事摆在你眼前。  
50:22 你们忘记　神的、要思想这事、免得我把你们撕碎、无人搭救。  
50:23 凡以感谢献上为祭的、便是荣耀我。那按正路而行的、我必使他得着我的救恩。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 51章     

51:1 〔大卫与拔示巴同室以后、先知拿单来见他。他作这诗、交与伶长。〕　神阿、求你按你的慈爱怜恤我、按你丰盛的慈悲涂抹我的过犯。  
51:2 求你将我的罪孽洗除净尽、并洁除我的罪。  
51:3 因为我知道我的过犯。我的罪常在我面前。  
51:4 我向你犯罪、惟独得罪了你、在你眼前行了这恶、以致你责备我的时候、显为公义。判断我的时候、显为清正。  
51:5 我是在罪孽里生的。在我母亲怀胎的时候、就有了罪。  

51:6 你所喜爱的、是内里诚实。你在我隐密处、必使我得智慧。  
51:7 求你用牛膝草洁净我、我就干净。求你洗涤我、我就比雪更白。  
51:8 求你使我得听欢喜快乐的声音、使你所压伤的骨头、可以踊跃。  
51:9 求你掩面不看我的罪、涂抹我一切的罪孽。  
51:10 　神阿、求你为我造清洁的心、使我里面重新有正直的灵。〔正直或作坚定〕  

51:11 不要丢弃我、使我离开你的面。不要从我收回你的圣灵。  
51:12 求你使我仍得救恩之乐、赐我乐意的灵扶持我。  
51:13 我就把你的道指教有过犯的人。罪人必归顺你。  
51:14 　神阿、你是拯救我的　神。求你救我脱离流人血的罪。我的舌头就高声歌唱你的公义。  
51:15 主阿、求你使我嘴唇张开、我的口便传扬赞美你的话。  

51:16 你本不喜爱祭物。若喜爱、我就献上。燔祭你也不喜悦。  
51:17 　神所要的祭、就是忧伤的灵。　神阿、忧伤痛悔的心、你必不轻看。  
51:18 求你随你的美意善待锡安、建造耶路撒冷的城墙。  
51:19 那时、你必喜爱公义的祭、和燔祭、并全牲的燔祭。那时、人必将公牛献在你坛上。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 52章   

52:1 〔以东人多益来告诉扫罗说、大卫到了亚希米勒家。那时、大卫作这训诲诗、交与伶长。〕勇士阿、你为何以作恶自夸。　神的慈爱是常存的。  
52:2 你的舌头邪恶诡诈、好像剃头刀、快利伤人。  
52:3 你爱恶胜似爱善、又爱说谎、不爱说公义。〔细拉〕  
52:4 诡诈的舌头阿、你爱说一切毁灭的话。  
52:5 　神也要毁灭你、直到永远。他要把你拿去、从你的帐棚中抽出、从活人之地将你拔出。〔细拉〕  

52:6 义人要看见而惧怕、并要笑他、  
52:7 说、看哪、这就是那不以　神为他力量的人。只倚仗他丰富的财物、在邪恶上坚立自己。  
52:8 至于我、就像　神殿中的青橄榄树。我永永远远倚靠　神的慈爱。  
52:9 我要称谢你、直到永远、因为你行了这事。我也要在你圣民面前仰望你的名。这名本为美好。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 53章  

53:1 〔大卫的训诲诗、交与伶长、调用麻哈拉。〕愚顽人心里说、没有　神。他们都是邪恶、行了可憎恶的罪孽。没有一个人行善。  
53:2 　神从天上垂看世人、要看有明白的没有、有寻求他的没有。  
53:3 他们各人都退后、一同变为污秽。并没有行善的、连一个也没有。  
53:4 作孽的没有知识么。他们吞吃我的百姓如同吃饭一样。并不求告　神。  
53:5 他们在无可惧怕之处、就大大害怕。因为　神把那安营攻击你之人的骨头散开了。你使他们蒙羞、因为　神弃绝了他们。  

53:6 但愿以色列的救恩从锡安而出。　神救回他被掳的子民、那时雅各要快乐、以色列要欢喜。

诗篇 54章   

54:1 〔西弗人来对扫罗说、大卫岂不是在我们那里藏身么。那时大卫作这训诲诗、交与伶长、用丝弦的乐器。〕　神阿、求你以你的名救我、凭你的大能为我伸冤。  
54:2 　神阿、求你听我的祷告、留心听我口中的言语。  
54:3 因为外人起来攻击我、强暴人寻索我的命。他们眼中没有　神。〔细拉〕  
54:4 　神是帮助我的、是扶持我命的。  
54:5 他要报应我仇敌所行的恶。求你凭你的诚实灭绝他们。  

54:6 我要把甘心祭献给你。耶和华阿、我要称赞你的名。这名本为美好。  
54:7 他从一切的急难中、把我救出来。我的眼睛也看见了我仇敌遭报。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 55章     

55:1 〔大卫的训诲诗、交与伶长、用丝弦的乐器。〕　神阿、求你留心听我的祷告。不要隐藏不听我的恳求。  
55:2 求你侧耳听我、应允我。我哀叹不安、发声唉哼。  
55:3 都因仇敌的声音、恶人的欺压。因为他们将罪孽加在我身上、发怒气逼迫我。  
55:4 我心在我里面甚是疼痛。死的惊惶临到我身。  
55:5 恐惧战兢归到我身、惊恐漫过了我。  

55:6 我说、但愿我有翅膀像鸽子、我就飞去、得享安息。  
55:7 我必远游、宿在旷野。〔细拉〕  
55:8 我必速速逃到避所、脱离狂风暴雨。  
55:9 主阿、求你吞灭他们、变乱他们的舌头。因为我在城中见了强暴争竞的事。  
55:10 他们在城墙上昼夜绕行。在城内也有罪孽和奸恶。  

55:11 邪恶在其中、欺压和诡诈不离街市。  
55:12 原来不是仇敌辱骂我。若是仇敌、还可忍耐。也不是恨我的人向我狂大。若是恨我的人、就必躲避他。  
55:13 不料是你、你原与我平等、是我的同伴、是我知己的朋友。  
55:14 我们素常彼此谈论、以为甘甜。我们与群众在　神的殿中同行。  
55:15 愿死亡忽然临到他们。愿他们活活的下入阴间。因为他们的住处、他们的心中、都是邪恶。  

55:16 至于我、我要求告　神。耶和华必拯救我。  
55:17 我要晚上、早晨、晌午、哀声悲叹。他也必听我的声音。  
55:18 他救赎我命脱离攻击我的人、使我得享平安。因为与我相争的人甚多。  
55:19 那没有更变、不敬畏　神的人、从太古常存的　神、必听见而苦待他。  
55:20 他背了约、伸手攻击与他和好的人。  

55:21 他的口如奶油光滑、他的心却怀着争战。他的话比油柔和、其实是拔出来的刀。  
55:22 你要把你的重担卸给耶和华、他必抚养你。他永不叫义人动摇。  
55:23 　神阿、你必使恶人下入灭亡的坑。流人血行诡诈的人、必活不到半世、但我要倚靠你。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 56章    

56:1 〔非利士人在迦特拿住大卫。那时他作这金诗、交与伶长、调用远方无声鸽。〕　神阿、求你怜悯我、因为人要把我吞了、终日攻击欺压我。  
56:2 我的仇敌终日要把我吞了。因逞骄傲攻击我的人甚多。  
56:3 我惧怕的时候要倚靠你。  
56:4 我倚靠　神、我要赞美他的话。我倚靠　神、必不惧怕。血气之辈能把我怎么样呢。  
56:5 他们终日颠倒我的话。他们一切的心思、都是要害我。  

56:6 他们聚集、埋伏窥探我的脚踪、等候要害我的命。  
56:7 他们岂能因罪孽逃脱么。　神阿、求你在怒中使众民堕落。  
56:8 我几次流离、你都记数。求你把我眼泪装在你的皮袋里。这不都记在你册子上么。  
56:9 我呼求的日子、我的仇敌都要转身退后。　神帮助我、这是我所知道的。  
56:10 我倚靠　神。我要赞美他的话。我倚靠耶和华。我要赞美他的话。  

56:11 我倚靠　神、必不惧怕。人能把我怎么样呢。  
56:12 　神阿、我向你所许的愿在我身上。我要将感谢祭献给你。  
56:13 因为你救我的命脱离死亡。你岂不是救护我的脚不跌倒、使我在生命光中行在　神面前么。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 57章   

57:1 〔大卫逃避扫罗、藏在洞里。那时他作这金诗、交与伶长、调用休要毁坏。〕　神阿、求你怜悯我、怜悯我。因为我的心投靠你。我要投靠在你翅膀的荫下、等到灾害过去。  
57:2 我要求告至高的　神、就是为我成全诸事的　神。  
57:3 那要吞我的人辱骂我的时候、　神从天上必施恩救我。也必向我发出慈爱和诚实。  
57:4 我的性命在狮子中间。我躺卧在性如烈火的世人当中。他们的牙齿是枪、箭。他们的舌头是快刀。  
57:5 　神阿、愿你崇高、过于诸天。愿你的荣耀、高过全地。  

57:6 他们为我的脚设下网罗、压制我的心。他们在我面前挖了坑、自己反掉在其中。〔细拉〕  
57:7 　神阿、我心坚定、我心坚定。我要唱诗、我要歌颂。  
57:8 我的灵阿、〔原文作荣耀〕你当醒起、琴瑟阿、你们当醒起。我自己要极早醒起。  
57:9 主阿、我要在万民中称谢你、在列邦中歌颂你。  
57:10 因为你的慈爱、高及诸天。你的诚实、达到穹苍。  

57:11 　神阿、愿你崇高过于诸天。愿你的荣耀、高过全地。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 58章   

58:1 〔大卫的金诗、交与伶长、调用休要毁坏。〕世人哪、你们默然不语、真合公义么。施行审判、岂按正直么。  
58:2 不然、你们是心中作恶。你们在地上秤出你们手所行的强暴。  
58:3 恶人一出母胎、就与　神疏远。一离母腹、便走错路、说谎话。  
58:4 他们的毒气、好像蛇的毒气。他们好像塞耳的聋虺、  
58:5 不听行法术的声音。虽用极灵的咒语、也是不听。  

58:6 　神阿、求你敲碎他们口中的牙。耶和华阿、求你敲掉少壮狮子的大牙。  
58:7 愿他们消灭如急流的水一般。他们瞅准射箭的时候、愿箭头彷彿砍断。  
58:8 愿他们像蜗牛消化过去、又像妇人坠落未见天日的胎。  
58:9 你们用荆棘烧火。锅还未热、他要用旋风把青的和烧着的一齐刮去。  
58:10 义人见仇敌遭报、就欢喜、要在恶人的血中洗脚。  

58:11 因此、人必说、义人诚然有善报。在地上果有施行判断的　神。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 59章     

59:1 〔扫罗打发人窥探大卫的房屋、要杀他。那时大卫用这金诗、交与伶长、调用休要毁坏。〕我的　神阿、求你救我脱离仇敌、把我安置在高处、得脱那些起来攻击我的人。  
59:2 求你救我脱离作孽的人、和喜爱流人血的人。  
59:3 因为他们埋伏、要害我的命、有能力的人聚集来攻击我。耶和华阿、这不是为我的过犯、也不是为我的罪愆。  
59:4 我虽然无过、他们预备整齐、跑来攻击我。求你兴起鉴察、帮助我。  
59:5 万军之　神耶和华以色列的　神阿。求你兴起、惩治万邦。不要怜悯行诡诈的恶人。〔细拉〕  

59:6 他们晚上转回、叫号如狗、围城绕行。  
59:7 他们口中喷吐恶言、嘴里有刀、他们说、有谁听见。  
59:8 但你耶和华必笑话他们。你要嗤笑万邦。  
59:9 我的力量阿、我必仰望你。因为　神是我的高台。  
59:10 我的　神要以慈爱迎接我。　神要叫我看见我仇敌遭报。  

59:11 不要杀他们、恐怕我的民忘记。主阿、你是我们的盾牌。求你用你的能力使他们四散、且降为卑。  
59:12 因他们口中的罪、和嘴里的言语、并咒骂虚谎的话、愿他们在骄傲之中被缠住了。  
59:13 求你发怒、使他们消灭、以至归于无有、叫他们知道　神在雅各中间掌权、直到地极。〔细拉〕  
59:14 到了晚上、任凭他们转回。任凭他们叫号如狗、围城绕行。  
59:15 他们必走来走去、寻找食物。若不得饱、就终夜在外。  

59:16 但我要歌颂你的力量、早晨要高唱你的慈爱。因为你作过我的高台。在我急难的日子、作过我的避难所。  
59:17 我的力量阿、我要歌颂你。因为　神是我的高台、是赐恩与我的　神。

60:2 你使地震动、而且崩裂。求你将裂口医好。因为地摇动。  
60:3 你叫你的民遇见艰难。你叫我们喝那使人东倒西歪的酒。  
60:4 你把旌旗赐给敬畏你的人、可以为真理扬起来。〔细拉〕  
60:5 求你应允我们、用右手拯救我们、好叫你所亲爱的人得救。  

60:6 　神已经指着他的圣洁说、〔说或作应许我〕我要欢乐。我要分开示剑、丈量疏割谷。  
60:7 基列是我的、玛拿西也是我的。以法莲是护卫我头的。犹大是我的杖。  
60:8 摩押是我的沐浴盆。我要向以东抛鞋。非利士阿、你还能因我欢呼么。  
60:9 谁能领我进坚固城。谁能引我到以东地。  
60:10 　神阿、你不是丢弃了我们么。　神阿、你不和我们的军兵同去么。

诗篇 61章   

61:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长、用丝弦的乐器。〕　神阿、求你听我的呼求、侧耳听我的祷告。  
61:2 我心里发昏的时候、我要从地极求告你。求你领我到那比我更高的磐石。  
61:3 因为你作过我的避难所、作过我的坚固台、脱离仇敌。  
61:4 我要永远住在你的帐幕里。我要投靠在你翅膀下的隐密处。〔细拉〕  
61:5 　神阿、你原是听了我所许的愿。你将产业赐给敬畏你名的人。  

61:6 你要加添王的寿数。他的年岁必存到世世。  
61:7 他必永远坐在　神面前。愿你预备慈爱和诚实保佑他。

诗篇 62章   

62:1 〔大卫的诗、照耶杜顿的作法、交与伶长。〕我的心默默无声、专等候　神。我的救恩是从他而来。  
62:2 惟独他是我的磐石、我的拯救。他是我的高台。我必不很动摇。  
62:3 你们大家攻击一人、把他毁坏、如同毁坏歪斜的墙、将倒的壁、要到几时呢。  
62:4 他们彼此商议、专要从他的尊位上把他推下。他们喜爱谎话。口虽祝福、心却咒诅。〔细拉〕

62:6 惟独他是我的磐石、我的拯救。他是我的高台。我必不动摇。

62:8 你们众民当时时倚靠他、在他面前倾心吐意。　神是我们的避难所。〔细拉〕  
62:9 下流人真是虚空、上流人也是虚假。放在天平里就必浮起。他们一共比空气还轻。  
62:10 不要仗势欺人、也不要因抢夺而骄傲。若财宝加增、不要放在心上。  

62:11 　神说了一次、两次、我都听见、就是能力都属乎　神。  
62:12 主阿、慈爱也是属乎你。因为你照着各人所行的报应他。

63:2 我在圣所中曾如此瞻仰你、为要见你的能力、和你的荣耀。  
63:3 因你的慈爱比生命更好、我的嘴唇要颂赞你。  
63:4 我还活的时候要这样称颂你。我要奉你的名举手。  
63:5 我在床上记念你、在夜更的时候思想你、我的心就像饱足了骨髓肥油。我也要以欢乐的嘴唇赞美你。  

63:6 见上节

诗篇 64章   

64:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕　神阿、我哀叹的时候、求你听我的声音。求你保护我的性命、不受仇敌的惊恐。  
64:2 求你把我隐藏、使我脱离作恶之人的暗谋、和作孽之人的扰乱。  
64:3 他们磨舌如刀、发出苦毒的言语、好像比准了的箭。  
64:4 要在暗地射完全人。他们忽然射他、并不惧怕。  
64:5 他们彼此勉励设下恶计。他们商量暗设网罗、说、谁能看见。  

64:6 他们图谋奸恶、说、我们是极力图谋的。他们各人的意念心思是深的。  
64:7 但　神要射他们。他们忽然被箭射伤。  
64:8 他们必然绊跌、被自己的舌头所害。凡看见他们的、必都摇头。  
64:9 众人都要害怕、要传扬　神的工作、并且明白他的作为。  
64:10 义人必因耶和华欢喜、并要投靠他。凡心里正直的人、都要夸口。

65:3 罪孽胜了我。至于我们的过犯、你都要赦免。  
65:4 你所拣选、使他亲近你、住在你院中的、这人便为有福。我们必因你居所、你圣殿的美福知足了。  
65:5 拯救我们的　神阿、你必以威严秉公义应允我们。你本是一切地极、和海上远处的人所倚靠的。  

65:6 他既以大能束腰、就用力量安定诸山。  
65:7 使诸海的响声、和其中波浪的响声、并万民的喧哗、都平静了。  
65:8 住在地极的人、因你的神迹惧怕。你使日出日落之地都欢呼。  
65:9 你眷顾地、降下透雨、使地大得肥美。　神的河满了水。你这样浇灌了地、好为人预备五谷。  
65:10 你浇透地的犁沟、润平犁脊。降甘霖、使地软和。其中发长的、蒙你赐福。  

65:11 你以恩典为年岁的冠冕。你的路径都滴下脂油。  
65:12 滴在旷野的草场上。小山以欢乐束腰。  
65:13 草场以羊群为衣。谷中也长满了五谷。这一切都欢呼歌唱。

66:8 万民哪、你们当称颂我们的　神、使人得听赞美他的声音。  
66:9 他使我们的性命存活、也不叫我们的脚摇动。

68:4 你们当向　神唱诗、歌颂他的名。为那坐车行过旷野的、修平大路。他的名是耶和华。要在他面前欢乐。  
68:5 　神在他的圣所作孤儿的父、作寡妇的伸冤者。  

68:6 　神叫孤独的有家、使被囚的出来享福。惟有悖逆的住在干燥之地。  
68:7 　神阿、你曾在你百姓前头出来、在旷野行走。〔细拉〕  
68:8 那时地见　神的面而震动、天也落雨。西乃山见以色列　神的面也震动。  
68:9 　神阿、你降下大雨。你产业以色列疲乏的时候、你使他坚固。  
68:10 你的会众住在其中。　神阿、你的恩惠是为困苦人预备的。  

68:11 主发命令、传好信息的妇女成了大群。  
68:12 统兵的君王逃跑了、逃跑了。在家等候的妇女、分受所夺的。  
68:13 你们安卧在羊圈的时候、好像鸽子的翅膀镀白银、翎毛镀黄金一般。  
68:14 全能者在境内赶散列王的时候、势如飘雪在撒们。  
68:15 巴珊山是　神的山。巴珊山是多峰多岭的山。  

68:16 你们多峰多岭的山哪、为何斜看　神所愿居住的山。耶和华必住这山、直到永远。  
68:17 　神的车辇累万盈千。主在其中、好像在西乃圣山一样。

68:22 主说、我要使众民从巴珊而归、使他们从深海而回。  
68:23 使你打碎仇敌、你的脚踹在血中、使你狗的舌头、从其中得分。  
68:24 　神阿、你是我的　神、我的王。人已经看见你行走、进入圣所。  
68:25 歌唱的行在前、作乐的随在后、都在击鼓的童女中间。  

68:26 从以色列源头而来的、当在各会中称颂主　神。  
68:27 在那里有统管他们的小便雅悯、有犹大的首领、和他们的群众。有西布伦的首领。有拿弗他利的首领。  
68:28 以色列的能力、是　神所赐的。　神阿、求你坚固你为我们所成全的事。  
68:29 因你耶路撒冷的殿、列王必带贡物献给你。  
68:30 求你叱喝芦苇中的野兽、和群公牛、并列邦中的牛犊、把银块踹在脚下。　神已经赶散好争战的列邦。  

68:31 埃及的公侯要出来朝见　神。古实人要急忙举手祷告。  
68:32 世上的列国阿、你们要向　神歌唱。愿你们歌颂主、  
68:33 歌颂那自古驾行在诸天以上的主。他发出声音、是极大的声音。  
68:34 你们要将能力归给　神。他的威荣在以色列之上、他的能力是在穹苍。

诗篇 69章       

69:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长、调用百合花。〕　神阿、求你救我。因为众水要淹没我。  
69:2 我陷在深淤泥中、没有立脚之地。我到了深水中。大水漫过我身。  
69:3 我因呼求困乏、喉咙发干。我因等候　神、眼睛失明。  
69:4 无故恨我的、比我头发还多。无理与我为仇、要把我剪除的、甚为强盛。我没有抢夺的、要叫我偿还。  
69:5 　神阿、我的愚昧你原知道。我的罪愆不能隐瞒。  

69:6 万军的主耶和华阿、求你叫那等候你的、不要因我蒙羞。以色列的　神阿、求你叫那寻求你的、不要因我受辱。  
69:7 因我为你的缘故受了辱骂、满面羞愧。  
69:8 我的弟兄看我为外路人。我的同胞看我为外邦人。  
69:9 因我为你的殿心里焦急、如同火烧。并且辱骂你人的辱骂、都落在我身上。  
69:10 我哭泣、以禁食刻苦我心、这倒算为我的羞辱。  

69:11 我拿麻布当衣裳、就成了他们的笑谈。  
69:12 坐在城门口的谈论我。酒徒也以我为歌曲。  
69:13 但我在悦纳的时候、向你耶和华祈祷。　神阿、求你按你丰盛的慈爱、凭你拯救的诚实、应允我。  
69:14 求你搭救我出离淤泥、不叫我陷在其中。求你使我脱离那些恨我的人、使我出离深水。  
69:15 求你不容大水漫过我、不容深渊吞灭我、不容坑坎在我以上合口。  

69:16 耶和华阿、求你应允我、因为你的慈爱本为美好。求你按你丰盛的慈悲、回转眷顾我。  
69:17 不要掩面不顾你的仆人。我是在急难之中。求你速速的应允我。  
69:18 求你亲近我、救赎我。求你因我的仇敌把我赎回。  
69:19 你知道我受的辱骂、欺凌、羞辱。我的敌人都在你面前。  
69:20 辱骂伤破了我的心。我又满了忧愁。我指望有人体恤、却没有一个。我指望有人安慰、却找不着一个。  

69:21 他们拿苦胆给我当食物。我渴了、他们拿醋给我喝。  
69:22 愿他们的筵席、在他们面前变为网罗、在他们平安的时候、变为机槛。  
69:23 愿他们的眼睛昏蒙、不得看见。愿你使他们的腰常常战抖。  
69:24 求你将你的恼恨、倒在他们身上、叫你的烈怒、追上他们。  
69:25 愿他们的住处、变为荒场。愿他们的帐棚、无人居住。  

69:26 因为你所击打的、他们就逼迫。你所击伤的、他们戏说他的愁苦。  
69:27 愿你在他们的罪上加罪、不容他们在你面前称义。  
69:28 愿他们从生命册上被涂抹、不得记录在义人之中。  
69:29 但我是困苦忧伤的。　神阿、愿你的救恩将我安置在高处。  
69:30 我要以诗歌赞美　神的名、以感谢称他为大。  

69:31 这便叫耶和华喜悦、胜似献牛、或是献有角有蹄的公牛。  
69:32 谦卑的人看见了、就喜乐。寻求　神的人、愿你们的心苏醒。  
69:33 因为耶和华听了穷乏人、不藐视被囚的人。  
69:34 愿天和地、洋海、和其中一切的动物、都赞美他。  
69:35 因为　神要拯救锡安、建造犹大的城邑。他的民要在那里居住、得以为业。  

69:36 他仆人的后裔、要承受为业。爱他名的人、也要住在其中。

诗篇 70章   

70:1 〔大卫的记念诗、交与伶长。〕　神阿、求你快快搭救我。耶和华阿、求你速速帮助我。  
70:2 愿那些寻索我命的、抱愧蒙羞。愿那些喜悦我遭害的、退后受辱。  
70:3 愿那些对我说、阿哈、阿哈的、因羞愧退后。  
70:4 愿一切寻求你的、因你高兴欢喜。愿那些喜爱你救恩的常说、当尊　神为大。  
70:5 但我是困苦穷乏的。　神阿、求你速速到我这里来。你是帮助我的、搭救我的。耶和华阿、求你不要耽延。  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 71章     

71:1 耶和华阿、我投靠你。求你叫我永不羞愧。  
71:2 求你凭你的公义搭救我、救拔我、侧耳听我、拯救我。  
71:3 求你作我常住的磐石。你已经命定要救我。因为你是我的岩石、我的山寨。  
71:4 我的　神阿、求你救我脱离恶人的手、脱离不义和残暴之人的手。  
71:5 主耶和华阿、你是我所盼望的。从我年幼你是我所倚靠的。  

71:6 我从出母胎被你扶持。使我出母腹的是你。我必常常赞美你。  
71:7 许多人以我为怪。但你是我坚固的避难所。  
71:8 你的赞美、你的荣耀、终日必满了我的口。  
71:9 我年老的时候、求你不要丢弃我。我力气衰弱的时候、求你不要离弃我。  
71:10 我的仇敌议论我。那些窥探要害我命的彼此商议、  

71:11 说、　神已经离弃他。我们追赶他、捉拿他吧。因为没有人搭救。  
71:12 　神阿、求你不要远离我。我的　神阿、求你速速帮助我。  
71:13 愿那与我性命为敌的、羞愧被灭。愿那谋害我的、受辱蒙羞。  
71:14 我却要常常盼望、并要越发赞美你。  
71:15 我的口终日要述说你的公义、和你的救恩。因我不计其数。  

71:16 我要来说主耶和华大能的事。我单要提说你的公义。  
71:17 　神阿、自我年幼时、你就教训我。直到如今、我传扬你奇妙的作为。  
71:18 　神阿、我到年老发白的时候、求你不要离弃我、等我将你的能力指示下代、将你的大能指示后世的人。  
71:19 　神阿、你的公义甚高。行过大事的　神阿、谁能像你。  
71:20 你是叫我们多经历重大急难的、必使我们复活。从地的深处救上来。  

71:21 求你使我越发昌大、又转来安慰我。  
71:22 我的　神阿、我要鼓瑟称赞你、称赞你的诚实。以色列的圣者阿、我要弹琴歌颂你。  
71:23 我歌颂你的时候、我的嘴唇、和你所赎我的灵魂、都必欢呼。  
71:24 并且我的舌头、必终日讲论你的公义、因为那些谋害我的人、已经蒙羞受辱了。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 72章    

72:1 〔所罗门的诗。〕　神阿、求你将判断的权柄赐给王、将公义赐给王的儿子。  
72:2 他要按公义审判你的民、按公平审判你的困苦人。  
72:3 大山小山、都要因公义使民得享平安。  
72:4 他必为民中的困苦人伸冤、拯救穷乏之辈、压碎那欺压人的。  
72:5 太阳还存、月亮还在、人要敬畏你、直到万代。  

72:6 他必降临、像雨降在已割的草地上、如甘霖滋润田地。  
72:7 在他的日子义人要发旺、大有平安、好像月亮长存。  
72:8 他要执掌权柄、从这海直到那海、从大河直到地极。  
72:9 住在旷野的、必在他面前下拜。他的仇敌必要餂土。  
72:10 他施和海岛的王要进贡。示巴和西巴的王要献礼物。  

72:11 诸王都要叩拜他、万国都要事奉他。  
72:12 因为穷乏人呼求的时候、他要搭救、没有人帮助的困苦人、他也要搭救。  
72:13 他要怜恤贫寒和穷乏的人、拯救穷苦人的性命。  
72:14 他要救赎他们脱离欺压和强暴。他们的血在他眼中看为宝贵、  
72:15 他们要存活。示巴的金子要奉给他。人要常常为他祷告、终日称颂他。  

72:16 在地的山顶上、五谷必然茂盛。〔五谷必然茂盛或作有一把五谷〕所结的谷实、要响动如利巴嫩的树林。城里的人、要发旺如地上的草。  
72:17 他的名要存到永远、要留传如日之久。人要因他蒙福。万国要称他有福。  
72:18 独行奇事的耶和华以色列的　神、是应当称颂的。  
72:19 他荣耀的名、也当称颂、直到永远。愿他的荣耀、充满全地。阿们、阿们。  
72:20 耶西的儿子大卫的祈祷完毕。

诗篇 73章      

73:1 〔亚萨的诗。〕　神实在恩待以色列那些清心的人。  
73:2 至于我、我的脚几乎失闪。我的脚险些滑跌。  
73:3 我见恶人和狂傲人享平安、就心怀不平。  
73:4 他们死的时候、没有疼痛。他们的力气、却也壮实。  
73:5 他们不像别人受苦、也不像别人遭灾。  

73:6 所以、骄傲如链子戴在他们的项上。强暴像衣裳遮住他们的身体。  
73:7 他们的眼睛因体胖而凸出。他们所得的、过于心里所想的。  
73:8 他们讥笑人、凭恶意说欺压人的话。他们说话自高。  
73:9 他们的口亵渎上天。他们的舌毁谤全地。  
73:10 所以　神的民归到这里、喝尽了满杯的苦水。  

73:11 他们说、　神怎能晓得。至高者岂有知识呢。  
73:12 看哪、这就是恶人。他们既是常享安逸、财宝便加增。  
73:13 我实在徒然洁净了我的心、徒然洗手表明无辜。  
73:14 因为我终日遭灾难、每早晨受惩治。  
73:15 我若说、我要这样讲、这就是以奸诈待你的众子。  

73:16 我思索怎能明白这事、眼看实系为难。  
73:17 等我进了　神的圣所、思想他们的结局。  
73:18 你实在把他们安在滑地、使他们掉在沉沦之中。  
73:19 他们转眼之间、成了何等的荒凉。他们被惊恐灭尽了。  
73:20 人睡醒了怎样看梦、主阿、你醒了、也必照样轻看他们的影像。  

73:21 因而我心里发酸、肺腑被刺。  
73:22 我这样愚昧无知、在你面前如畜类一般。  
73:23 然而我常与你同在。你搀着我的右手。  
73:24 你要以你的训言引导我、以后必接我到荣耀里。  
73:25 除你以外、在天上我有谁呢。除你以外、在地上我也没有所爱慕的。  

73:26 我的肉体、和我的心肠衰残。但　神是我心里的力量、又是我的福分、直到永远。  
73:27 远离你的、必要死亡。凡离弃你行邪淫的、你都灭绝了。  
73:28 但我亲近　神是与我有益。我以主耶和华为我的避难所、好叫我述说你一切的作为。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 74章     

74:1 〔亚萨的训诲诗。〕　神阿、你为何永远丢弃我们呢。你为何向你草场的羊发怒如烟冒出呢。  
74:2 求你记念你古时所得来的会众、就是你所赎作你产业支派的。并记念你向来所居住的锡安山。  
74:3 求你举步去看那日久荒凉之地、仇敌在圣所中所行的一切恶事。  
74:4 你的敌人在你会中吼叫。他们竖了自己的旗为记号。  
74:5 他们好像人扬起斧子、砍伐林中的树。  

74:6 圣所中一切雕刻的、他们现在用斧子锤子打坏了。  
74:7 他们用火焚烧你的圣所、亵渎你名的居所、拆毁到地。  
74:8 他们心里说、我们要尽行毁灭、他们就在遍地把　神的会所都烧毁了。  
74:9 我们不见我们的标帜。不再有先知。我们内中也没有人知道这灾祸要到几时呢。  
74:10 　神阿、敌人辱骂要到几时呢。仇敌亵渎你的名、要到永远么。  

74:11 你为甚么缩回你的右手。求你从怀中伸出来、毁灭他们。  
74:12 　神自古以来为我的王、在地上施行拯救。  
74:13 你曾用能力将海分开、将水中大鱼的头打破。  
74:14 你曾砸碎鳄鱼的头、把他给旷野的禽兽为食物。〔禽兽原文作民〕  
74:15 你曾分裂磐石、水便成了溪河、你使长流的江河干了。  

74:16 白昼属你、黑夜也属你。亮光和日头、是你所预备的。  
74:17 地的一切疆界、是你所立的。夏天和冬天、是你所定的。  
74:18 耶和华阿、仇敌辱骂、愚顽民亵渎了你的名、求你记念这事。  
74:19 不要将你斑鸠的性命交给野兽。不要永远忘记你困苦人的性命。  
74:20 求你顾念所立的约。因为地上黑暗之处、都满了强暴的居所。  

74:21 不要叫受欺压的人蒙羞回去。要叫困苦穷乏的人赞美你的名。  
74:22 　神阿、求你起来、为自己伸诉。要记念愚顽人怎样终日辱骂你。  
74:23 不要忘记你敌人的声音。那起来敌你之人的喧哗时常上升。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 75章   

75:1 〔亚萨的诗歌、交与伶长、调用休要毁坏。〕　神阿、我们称谢你、我们称谢你。因为你的名相近、人都述说你奇妙的作为。  
75:2 我到了所定的日期、必按正直施行审判。  
75:3 地和其上的居民、都消化了。我曾立了地的柱子。〔细拉〕  
75:4 我对狂傲人说、不要行事狂傲。对凶恶人说、不要举角。  
75:5 不要把你们的角高举。不要挺着颈项说话。  

75:6 因为高举非从东、非从西、也非从南而来。  
75:7 惟有　神断定。他使这人降卑、使那人升高。  
75:8 耶和华手里有杯。其中的酒起沫。杯内满了搀杂的酒。他倒出来。地上的恶人必都喝这酒的渣滓、而且喝尽。  
75:9 但我要宣扬、直到永远。我要歌颂雅各的　神。  
75:10 恶人一切的角、我要砍断。惟有义人的角、必被高举。  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 76章   

76:1 〔亚萨的诗歌、交与伶长、用丝弦的乐器。〕在犹大　神为人所认识。在以色列他的名为大。  
76:2 在撒冷有他的帐幕、在锡安有他的居所。  
76:3 他在那里折断弓上的火箭、并盾牌、刀剑、和争战的兵器。〔细拉〕  
76:4 你从有野食之山而来、有光华和荣美。  
76:5 心中勇敢的人、都被抢夺。他们睡了长觉。没有一个英雄能措手。  

76:6 雅各的　神阿、你的斥责一发坐车的、骑马的都沉睡了。  
76:7 惟独你是可畏的。你怒气一发、谁能在你面前站得住呢。  
76:8 你从天上使人听判断。　神起来施行审判、要救地上一切谦卑的人。那时地就惧怕而静默。〔细拉〕  
76:9 见上节
76:10 人的忿怒、要成全你的荣美。人的余怒、你要禁止。  

76:11 你们许愿、当向耶和华你们的　神还愿。在他四面的人、都当拿贡物献给那可畏的主。  
76:12 他要挫折王子的骄气。他向地上的君王、显威可畏。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 77章    

77:1 〔亚萨的诗、照耶杜顿的作法、交与伶长。〕我要向　神发声呼求。我向　神发声、他必留心听我。  
77:2 我在患难之日寻求主。我在夜间不住的举手祷告。我的心不肯受安慰。  
77:3 我想念　神、就烦躁不安。我沉吟悲伤、心便发昏。〔细拉〕  
77:4 你叫我不能闭眼。我烦乱不安、甚至不能说话。  
77:5 我追想古时之日、上古之年。  

77:6 我想起我夜间的歌曲、扪心自问。我心里也仔细省察。  
77:7 难道主要永远丢弃我、不再施恩么。  
77:8 难道他的慈爱永远穷尽、他的应许世世废弃么。  
77:9 难道　神忘记开恩。因发怒就止住他的慈悲么。〔细拉〕  
77:10 我便说、这是我的懦弱。但我要追念至高者显出右手之年代。  

77:11 我要提说耶和华所行的。我要记念你古时的奇事。  
77:12 我也要思想你的经营、默念你的作为。  
77:13 　神阿、你的作为是洁净的。有何神大如　神呢。  
77:14 你是行奇事的　神。你曾在列邦中、彰显你的能力。  
77:15 你曾用你的膀臂赎了你的民、就是雅各和约瑟的子孙。〔细拉〕  

77:16 　神阿、诸水见你、一见就都惊惶。深渊也都战抖。  
77:17 云中倒出水来。天空发出响声。你的箭也飞行四方。  
77:18 你的雷声在旋风中。电光照亮世界。大地战抖震动。  
77:19 你的道在海中、你的路在大水中、你的脚踪无人知道。  
77:20 你曾借摩西和亚伦的手、引导你的百姓、好像羊群一般。  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 78章       

78:1 〔亚萨的训诲诗。〕我的民哪、你们要留心听我的训诲、侧耳听我口中的话。  
78:2 我要开口说比喻。我要说出古时的谜语。  
78:3 是我们所听见所知道的、也是我们的祖宗告诉我们的。  
78:4 我们不将这些事向他们的子孙隐瞒。要将耶和华的美德和他的能力、并他奇妙的作为、述说给后代听。  
78:5 因为他在雅各中立法度、在以色列中设律法、是他吩咐我们祖宗、要传给子孙的。  

78:6 使将要生的后代子孙、可以晓得。他们也要起来告诉他们的子孙。  
78:7 好叫他们仰望　神、不忘记　神的作为。惟要守他的命令。  
78:8 不要像他们的祖宗、是顽梗悖逆居心不正之辈、向着　神心不诚实。  
78:9 以法莲的子孙、带着兵器、拿着弓、临阵之日、转身退后。  
78:10 他们不遵守　神的约、不肯照他的律法行。  

78:11 又忘记他所行的、和他显给他们奇妙的作为。  
78:12 他在埃及地、在琐安田、在他们祖宗的眼前、施行奇事。  
78:13 他将海分裂、使他们过去。又叫水立起如垒。  
78:14 他白日用云彩、终夜用火光、引导他们。  
78:15 他在旷野分裂磐石、多多的给他们水喝、如从深渊而出。  

78:16 他使水从磐石涌出、叫水如江河下流。  
78:17 他们却仍旧得罪他、在干燥之地悖逆至高者。  
78:18 他们心中试探　神、随自己所欲的求食物。  
78:19 并且妄论　神、说、　神在旷野岂能摆设筵席么。  
78:20 他曾击打磐石、使水涌出、成了江河。他还能赐粮食么。还能为他的百姓预备肉么。  

78:21 所以耶和华听见、就发怒。有烈火向雅各烧起、有怒气向以色列上腾。  
78:22 因为他们不信服　神、不倚赖他的救恩。  
78:23 他却吩咐天空、又敞开天上的门、  
78:24 降吗哪像雨给他们吃、将天上的粮食赐给他们。  
78:25 各人〔或作人〕吃大能者的食物。他赐下粮食、使他们饱足。  

78:26 他领东风起在天空、又用能力引了南风来。  
78:27 他降肉像雨在他们当中、多如尘土、又降飞鸟、多如海沙、  
78:28 落在他们的营中、在他们住处的四面。  
78:29 他们吃了、而且饱足。这样、就随了他们所欲的。  
78:30 他们贪而无厌、食物还在他们口中的时候、  

78:31 　神的怒气、就向他们上腾、杀了他们内中的肥壮人、打倒以色列的少年人。  
78:32 虽是这样、他们仍旧犯罪、不信他奇妙的作为。  
78:33 因此他叫他们的日子、全归虚空、叫他们的年岁、尽属惊恐。  
78:34 他杀他们的时候、他们才求问他、回心转意、切切的寻求　神。  
78:35 他们也追念　神是他们的磐石、至高的　神、是他们的救赎主。  

78:36 他们却用口谄媚他、用舌向他说谎。  
78:37 因他们的心向他不正、在他的约上也不忠心。  
78:38 但他有怜悯、赦免他们的罪孽、不灭绝他们。而且屡次消他的怒气、不发尽他的忿怒。  
78:39 他想到他们不过是血气、是一阵去而不返的风。  
78:40 他们在旷野悖逆他、在荒地叫他担忧、何其多呢。  

78:41 他们再三试探　神、惹动以色列的圣者。  
78:42 他们不追念他的能力、〔原文作手〕和赎他们脱离敌人的日子。  
78:43 他怎样在埃及地显神迹、在琐安田显奇事、  
78:44 把他们的江河、并河汊的水、都变为血、使他们不能喝。  
78:45 他叫苍蝇成群、落在他们当中、嘬尽他们。又叫青蛙灭了他们。  

78:46 把他们的土产交给蚂蚱、把他们辛苦得来的交给蝗虫。  
78:47 他降冰雹打坏他们的葡萄树。下严霜打坏他们的桑树。  
78:48 又把他们的牲畜交给冰雹。把他们的群畜交给闪电。  
78:49 他使猛烈的怒气、和忿怒、恼恨、苦难、成了一群降灾的使者、临到他们。  
78:50 他为自己的怒气修平了路、将他们交给瘟疫、使他们死亡。  

78:51 在埃及击杀一切长子、在含的帐棚中、击杀他们强壮时头生的。  
78:52 他却领出自己的民如羊、在旷野引他们如羊群。  
78:53 他领他们稳稳妥妥的、使他们不至害怕。海却淹没他们的仇敌。  
78:54 他带他们到自己圣地的边界、到他右手所得的这山地。  
78:55 他在他们面前赶出外邦人、用绳子将外邦的地量给他们为业、叫以色列支派的人住在他们的帐棚里。  

78:56 他们仍旧试探悖逆至高的　神、不守他的法度。  
78:57 反倒退后、行诡诈、像他们的祖宗一样。他们改变、如同翻背的弓。  
78:58 因他们的丘坛、惹了他的怒气、因他们雕刻的偶像、触动他的愤恨。  
78:59 　神听见、就发怒、极其憎恶以色列人。  
78:60 甚至他离弃示罗的帐幕、就是他在人间所搭的帐棚。  

78:61 又将他的约柜〔原文作能力〕交与人掳去、将他的荣耀交在敌人手中。  
78:62 并将他的百姓交与刀剑、向他的产业发怒。  
78:63 少年人被火烧灭。处女也无喜歌。  
78:64 祭司倒在刀下。寡妇却不哀哭。  
78:65 那时主像世人睡醒、像勇士饮酒呼喊。  

78:66 他就打退了他的敌人、叫他们永蒙羞辱。  
78:67 并且他弃掉约瑟的帐棚、不拣选以法莲支派、  
78:68 却拣选犹大支派、他所喜爱的锡安山。  
78:69 盖造他的圣所、好像高峰、又像他建立永存之地。  
78:70 又拣选他的仆人大卫、从羊圈中将他召来。  

78:71 叫他不再跟从那些带奶的母羊、为要牧养自己的百姓雅各、和自己的产业以色列。  
78:72 于是他按心中的纯正、牧养他们、用手中的巧妙、引导他们。

诗篇 79章    

79:1 〔亚萨的诗。〕　神阿、外邦人进入你的产业、污秽你的圣殿、使耶路撒冷变成荒堆。  
79:2 把你仆人的尸首、交与天空的飞鸟为食、把你圣民的肉、交与地上的野兽。  
79:3 在耶路撒冷周围流他们的血如水、无人葬埋。  
79:4 我们成为邻国的羞辱、成为我们四围人的嗤笑讥刺。  
79:5 耶和华阿、这到几时呢。你要动怒到永远么。你的愤恨要如火焚烧么。  

79:6 愿你将你的忿怒倒在那不认识你的外邦、和那不求告你名的国度。  
79:7 因为他们吞了雅各、把他的住处变为荒场。  
79:8 求你不要记念我们先祖的罪孽、向我们追讨。愿你的慈悲快迎着我们。因为我们落到极卑微的地步。  
79:9 拯救我们的　神阿、求你因你名的荣耀、帮助我们、为你名的缘故、搭救我们、赦免我们的罪。  
79:10 为何容外邦人说、他们的　神在哪里呢。愿你使外邦人知道你在我们眼前、伸你仆人流血的冤。  

79:11 愿被囚之人的叹息、达到你面前。愿你按你的大能力、存留那些将要死的人。  
79:12 主阿、愿你将我们邻邦所羞辱你的羞辱、加七倍归到他们身上。  
79:13 这样、你的民、你草场的羊、要称谢你、直到永远。要述说赞美你的话、直到万代。

诗篇 80章     

80:1 〔亚萨的诗、交与伶长、调用为证的百合花。〕领约瑟如领羊群之以色列的牧者阿、求你留心听。坐在二基路伯上的阿、求你发出光来。  
80:2 在以法莲便雅悯玛拿西前面施展你的大能、来救我们。  
80:3 　神阿、求你使我们回转、〔回转或作复兴〕使你的脸发光、我们便要得救。  
80:4 耶和华万军之　神阿、你向你百姓的祷告发怒、要到几时呢。  
80:5 你以眼泪当食物给他们吃、又多量出眼泪给他们喝。  

80:6 你使邻邦因我们分争。我们的仇敌彼此戏笑。  
80:7 万军之　神阿、求你使我们回转、使你的脸发光、我们便要得救。  
80:8 你从埃及挪出一棵葡萄树、赶出外邦人、把这树栽上。  
80:9 你在这树根前预备了地方、他就深深扎根、爬满了地。  
80:10 他的影子遮满了山、枝子好像佳美的香柏树。  

80:11 他发出枝子、长到大海、发出蔓子、延到大河。  
80:12 你为何拆毁这树的篱笆、任凭一切过路的人摘取。  
80:13 林中出来的野猪、把他糟踏、野地的走兽、拿他当食物。  
80:14 万军之　神阿、求你回转、从天上垂看、眷顾这葡萄树、  
80:15 保护你右手所栽的、和你为自己所坚固的枝子。  

80:16 这树已经被火焚烧被刀砍伐。他们因你脸上的怒容就灭亡了。  
80:17 愿你的手扶持你右边的人、就是你为自己所坚固的人子。  
80:18 这样、我们便不退后离开你。求你救活我们、我们就要求告你的名。  
80:19 耶和华万军之　神阿、求你使我们回转、使你的脸发光、我们便要得救。

诗篇 81章    

81:1 〔亚萨的诗、交与伶长、用迦特乐器。〕你们当向　神我们的力量大声欢呼、向雅各的　神发声欢乐、  
81:2 唱起诗歌、打手鼓、弹美琴与瑟。  
81:3 当在月朔、并月望我们过节的日期、吹角。  
81:4 因这是为以色列定的律例、是雅各　神的典章。  
81:5 他去攻击埃及地的时候、在约瑟中间立此为证。我在那里听见我所不明白的言语。  

81:6 　神说、我使你的肩得脱重担、你的手放下筐子。  
81:7 你在急难中呼求、我就搭救你。我在雷的隐密处应允你、在米利巴水那里试验你。〔细拉〕  
81:8 我的民哪、你当听。我要劝戒你。以色列阿、甚愿你肯听从我。  
81:9 在你当中不可有别的神。外邦的神、你也不可下拜。  
81:10 我是耶和华你的　神、曾把你从埃及地领上来。你要大大张口、我就给你充满。  

81:11 无奈我的民不听我的声音。以色列全不理我。  
81:12 我便任凭他们心里刚硬、随自己的计谋而行。  
81:13 甚愿我的民肯听从我、以色列肯行我的道。  
81:14 我便速速治服他们的仇敌、反手攻击他们的敌人。  
81:15 恨耶和华的人必来投降、但他的百姓必永久长存。  

81:16 他也必拿上好的麦子给他们吃。又拿从磐石出的蜂蜜、叫他们饱足。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 82章   

82:1 〔亚萨的诗。〕　神站在有权力者的会中。在诸神中行审判。  
82:2 说、你们审判不秉公义、徇恶人的情面、要到几时呢。〔细拉〕  
82:3 你们当为贫寒的人和孤儿伸冤。当为困苦和穷乏的人施行公义。  
82:4 当保护贫寒和穷乏的人、救他们脱离恶人的手。  
82:5 你们仍不知道、也不明白、在黑暗中走来走去。地的根基都摇动了。  

82:6 我曾说、你们是神、都是至高者的儿子。  
82:7 然而你们要死、与世人一样。要仆倒、像王子中的一位。  
82:8 　神阿、求你起来、审判世界。因为你要得万邦为业。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 83章    

83:1 〔亚萨的诗歌。〕　神阿、求你不要静默。　神阿、求你不要闭口、也不要不作声。  
83:2 因为你的仇敌喧嚷。恨你的抬起头来。  
83:3 他们同谋奸诈要害你的百姓、彼此商议要害你所隐藏的人。  
83:4 他们说、来吧、我们将他们剪灭、使他们不再成国。使以色列的名、不再被人记念。  
83:5 他们同心商议、彼此结盟、要抵挡你。  

83:6 就是住帐棚的以东人、和以实玛利人。摩押和夏甲人。  
83:7 迦巴勒、亚扪、和亚玛力、非利士、并推罗的居民。  
83:8 亚述也与他们连合。他们作罗得子孙的帮手。〔细拉〕  
83:9 求你待他们如待米甸、如在基顺河待西西拉和耶宾一样。  
83:10 他们在隐多珥灭亡、成了地上的粪土。  

83:11 求你叫他们的首领、像俄立和西伊伯、叫他们的王子、都像西巴和撒慕拿。  
83:12 他们说、我们要得　神的住处、作为自己的产业。  
83:13 我的　神阿、求你叫他们像旋风的尘土、像风前的碎稓。  
83:14 火怎样焚烧树林、火焰怎样烧着山岭。  
83:15 求你也照样用狂风追赶他们、用暴雨恐吓他们。  

83:16 愿你使他们满面羞耻。好叫他们寻求你耶和华的名。  
83:17 愿他们永远羞愧惊惶。愿他们惭愧灭亡。  
83:18 使他们知道惟独你名为耶和华的、是全地以上的至高者。

诗篇 84章   

84:1 〔可拉后裔的诗、交与伶长、用迦特乐器。〕万军之耶和华阿、你的居所何等可爱。  
84:2 我羡慕渴想耶和华的院宇。我的心肠、我的肉体、向永生　神呼吁。〔或作欢呼〕  
84:3 万军之耶和华我的王、我的　神阿、在你祭坛那里、麻雀为自己找着房屋。燕子为自己找着菢雏之窝。  
84:4 如此住在你殿中的便为有福。他们仍要赞美你。〔细拉〕  
84:5 靠你有力量心中想往锡安大道的、这人便为有福。  

84:6 他们经过流泪谷、叫这谷变为泉源之地。并有秋雨之福、盖满了全谷。  
84:7 他们行走、力上加力、各人到锡安朝见　神。  
84:8 耶和华万军之　神阿、求你听我的祷告。雅各的　神阿、求你留心听。〔细拉〕  
84:9 　神阿、你是我们的盾牌。求你垂顾观看你受膏者的面。  
84:10 在你的院宇住一日、胜似在别处住千日。宁可在我　神殿中看门、不愿住在恶人的帐棚里。  

84:11 因为耶和华　神是日头、是盾牌、要赐下恩惠和荣耀。他未尝留下一样好处、不给那些行动正直的人。  
84:12 万军之耶和华阿、倚靠你的人、便为有福。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 85章    

85:1 〔可拉后裔的诗、交与伶长。〕耶和华阿、你已经向你的地施恩、救回被掳的雅各。  
85:2 你赦免了你百姓的罪孽、遮盖了他们一切的过犯。〔细拉〕  
85:3 你收转了所发的忿怒、和你猛烈的怒气。  
85:4 拯救我们的　神阿、求你使我们回转、叫你的恼恨向我们止息。  
85:5 你要向我们发怒到永远么、你要将你的怒气延留到万代么。  

85:6 你不再将我们救活、使你的百姓靠你欢喜么。  
85:7 耶和华阿、求你使我们得见你的慈爱、又将你的救恩赐给我们。  
85:8 我要听　神耶和华所说的话。因为他必应许将平安赐给他的百姓、他的圣民。他们却不可再转去妄行。  
85:9 他的救恩、诚然与敬畏他的人相近、叫荣耀住在我们的地上。  
85:10 慈爱和诚实、彼此相遇。公义和平安、彼此相亲。  

85:11 诚实从地而生、公义从天而现。  
85:12 耶和华必将好处赐给我们。我们的地、也要多出土产。  
85:13 公义要行在他面前、叫他的脚踪、成为可走的路。

86:1 〔大卫的祈祷。〕耶和华阿、求你侧耳应允我、因我是困苦穷乏的。

86:3 主阿、求你怜悯我、因我终日求告你。  
86:4 主阿、求你使仆人心里欢喜。因为我的心仰望你。  
86:5 主阿、你本为良善、乐意饶恕人、有丰盛的慈爱、赐给凡求告你的人。  

86:6 耶和华阿、求你留心听我的祷告、垂听我恳求的声音。  
86:7 我在患难之日要求告你。因为你必应允我。  
86:8 主阿、诸神之中没有可比你的。你的作为也无可比。  
86:9 主阿、你所造的万民、都要来敬拜你。他们也要荣耀你的名。  
86:10 因你为大、且行奇妙的事。惟独你是　神。  

86:11 耶和华阿、求你将你的道指教我。我要照你的真理行。求你使我专心敬畏你的名。  
86:12 主我的　神阿、我要一心称赞你。我要荣耀你的名、直到永远。  
86:13 因为你向我发的慈爱是大的。你救了我的灵魂、免入极深的阴间。  
86:14 　神阿、骄傲的人起来攻击我、又有一党强横的人寻索我的命。他们没有将你放在眼中。  
86:15 主阿、你是有怜悯有恩典的　神、不轻易发怒、并有丰盛的慈爱和诚实。  

86:16 求你向我转脸、怜恤我、将你的力量赐给仆人、救你婢女的儿子。  
86:17 求你向我显出恩待我的凭据、叫恨我的人看见、便羞愧、因为你耶和华帮助我、安慰我。

诗篇 87章   

87:1 〔可拉后裔的诗歌。〕耶和华所立的根基在圣山上。  
87:2 他爱锡安的门、胜于爱雅各一切的住处。  
87:3 　神的城阿、有荣耀的事乃指着你说的。〔细拉〕  
87:4 我要提起拉哈伯和巴比伦人是在认识我之中的、看哪、非利士、和推罗、并古实人、个个生在那里。  
87:5 论到锡安必说、这一个那一个都生在其中。而且至高者必亲自坚立这城。  

87:6 当耶和华记录万民的时候、他要点出这一个生在那里。〔细拉〕  
87:7 歌唱的、跳舞的、都要说、我的泉源都在你里面。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 88章    

88:1 〔可拉后裔的诗歌、就是以斯拉人希幔的训诲诗、交与伶长、调用麻哈拉利暗俄。〕耶和华拯救我的　神阿、我昼夜在你面前呼吁。  
88:2 愿我的祷告达到你面前。求你侧耳听我的呼求。  
88:3 因为我心里满了患难、我的性命临近阴间。  
88:4 我算和下坑的人同列、如同无力的人一样。〔无力或作没有帮助〕  
88:5 我被丢在死人中、好像被杀的人、躺在坟墓里。他们是你不再记念的、与你隔绝了。  

88:6 你把我放在极深的坑里、在黑暗地方、在深处。  
88:7 你的忿怒重压我身。你用一切的波浪困住我。〔细拉〕  
88:8 你把我所认识的隔在远处、使我为他们所憎恶。我被拘困、不得出来。  
88:9 我的眼睛、因困苦而干瘪。耶和华阿、我天天求告你、向你举手。  
88:10 你岂要行奇事给死人看么。难道阴魂还能起来称赞你么。〔细拉〕  

88:11 岂能在坟墓里述说你的慈爱么。岂能在灭亡中述说你的信实么。  
88:12 你的奇事、岂能在幽暗里被知道么。你的公义岂能在忘记之地被知道么。  
88:13 耶和华阿、我呼求你。我早晨的祷告要达到你面前。  
88:14 耶和华阿、你为何丢弃我。为何掩面不顾我。  
88:15 我自幼受苦、几乎死亡。我受你的惊恐、甚至慌张。  

88:16 你的烈怒漫过我身。你的惊吓、把我剪除。  
88:17 这些终日如水环绕我、一齐都来围困我。  
88:18 你把我的良朋密友隔在远处、使我所认识的人、进入黑暗里。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 89章       

89:1 〔以斯拉人以探的训诲诗。〕我要歌唱耶和华的慈爱、直到永远。我要用口将你的信实传与万代。  
89:2 因我曾说、你的慈悲、必建立到永远。你的信实、必坚立在天上。  
89:3 我与我所拣选的人立了约、向我的仆人大卫起了誓。  
89:4 我要建立你的后裔、直到永远、要建立你的宝座、直到万代。  
89:5 耶和华阿、诸天要称赞你的奇事。在圣者的会中、要称赞你的信实。  

89:6 在天空谁能比耶和华呢。神的众子中、谁能像耶和华呢。  
89:7 他在圣者的会中、是大有威严的　神、比一切在他四围的更可畏惧。  
89:8 耶和华万军之　神阿、那一个大能者像你耶和华。你的信实、是在你的四围。  
89:9 你管辖海的狂傲。波浪翻腾、你就使他平静了。  
89:10 你打碎了拉哈伯似乎是已杀的人。你用有能的膀臂打散了你的仇敌。  

89:11 天属你、地也属你。世界和其中所充满的、都为你所建立。  
89:12 南北为你所创造。他泊和黑门都因你的名欢呼。  
89:13 你有大能的膀臂。你的手有力、你的右手也高举。  
89:14 公义和公平、是你宝座的根基。慈爱和诚实、行在你前面。  
89:15 知道向你欢呼的、那民是有福的。耶和华阿、他们在你脸上的光里行走。  

89:16 他们因你的名终日欢乐、因你的公义得以高举。  
89:17 你是他们力量的荣耀。因为你喜悦我们、我们的角必被高举。  
89:18 我们的盾牌属耶和华。我们的王属以色列的圣者。  
89:19 当时你在异象中晓谕你的圣民、说、我已把救助之力、加在那有能者的身上。我高举那从民中所拣选的。  
89:20 我寻得我的仆人大卫、用我的圣膏膏他。  

89:21 我的手必使他坚立。我的膀臂也必坚固他。  
89:22 仇敌必不勒索他、凶恶之子、也不苦害他。  
89:23 我要在他面前打碎他的敌人、击杀那恨他的人。  
89:24 只是我的信实、和我的慈爱、要与他同在。因我的名、他的角必被高举。  
89:25 我要使他的左手伸到海上、右手伸到河上。  

89:26 他要称呼我说、你是我的父、是我的　神、是拯救我的磐石。  
89:27 我也要立他为长子、为世上最高的君王。  
89:28 我要为他存留我的慈爱、直到永远。我与他立的约、必要坚定。  
89:29 我也要使他的后裔、存到永远、使他的宝座、如天之久。  
89:30 倘若他的子孙离弃我的律法、不照我的典章行。  

89:31 背弃我的律例、不遵守我的诫命。  
89:32 我就要用杖责罚他们的过犯、用鞭责罚他们的罪孽。  
89:33 只是我必不将我的慈爱、全然收回、也必不叫我的信实废弃。  
89:34 我必不背弃我的约、也不改变我口中所出的。  
89:35 我一次指着自己的圣洁起誓。我决不向大卫说谎。  

89:36 他的后裔要存到永远、他的宝座在我面前、如日之恒一般。  
89:37 又如月亮永远坚立、如天上确实的见证。〔细拉〕  
89:38 但你恼怒你的受膏者、就丢掉弃绝他。  
89:39 你厌恶了与仆人所立的约、将他的冠冕践踏于地。  
89:40 你拆毁了他一切的篱笆。使他的保障、变为荒场。  

89:41 凡过路的人、都抢夺他。他成为邻邦的羞辱。  
89:42 你高举了他敌人的右手。你叫他一切的仇敌欢喜。  
89:43 你叫他的刀剑卷刃、叫他在争战之中站立不住。  
89:44 你使他的光辉止息、将他的宝座推倒于地。  
89:45 你减少他青年的日子。又使他蒙羞。〔细拉〕  

89:46 耶和华阿、这要到几时呢。你要将自己隐藏到永远么。你的忿怒如火焚烧、要到几时呢。  
89:47 求你想念我的时候是何等的短少。你创造世人、要使他们归何等的虚空呢。〔细拉〕  
89:48 谁能常活免死、救他的灵魂脱离阴间的权柄呢。〔细拉〕  
89:49 主阿、你从前凭你的信实向大卫立誓、要施行的慈爱在哪里呢。  
89:50 主阿、求你记念仆人们所受的羞辱、记念我怎样将一切强盛民的羞辱存在我怀里。  

89:51 耶和华阿、你的仇敌、用这羞辱羞辱了你的仆人、羞辱了你受膏者的脚踪。  
89:52 耶和华是应当称颂的、直到永远。阿们、阿们。

诗篇 90章     

90:1 〔神人摩西的祈祷。〕主阿、你世世代代作我们的居所。  
90:2 诸山未曾生出、地与世界你未曾造成、从亘古到永远、你是　神。  
90:3 你使人归于尘土、说、你们世人要归回。  
90:4 在你看来、千年如已过的昨日、又如夜间的一更。  
90:5 你叫他们如水冲去。他们如睡一觉。早晨、他们如生长的草。  

90:6 早晨发芽生长、晚上割下枯干。  
90:7 我们因你的怒气而消灭、因你的忿怒而惊惶。  
90:8 你将我们的罪孽摆在你面前、将我们的隐恶摆在你面光之中。  
90:9 我们经过的日子、都在你震怒之下。我们度尽的年岁、好像一声叹息。  
90:10 我们一生的年日是七十岁。若是强壮可到八十岁。但其中所矜夸的、不过是劳苦愁烦。转眼成空、我们便如飞而去。  

90:11 谁晓得你怒气的权势、谁按着你该受的敬畏晓得你的忿怒呢。  
90:12 求你指教我们怎样数算自己的日子、好叫我们得着智慧的心。  
90:13 耶和华阿、我们要等到几时呢。求你转回、为你的仆人后悔。  
90:14 求你使我们早早饱得你的慈爱、好叫我们一生一世欢呼喜乐。  
90:15 求你照着你使我们受苦的日子、和我们遭难的年岁、叫我们喜乐。  

90:16 愿你的作为向你仆人显现。愿你的荣耀向他们子孙显明。  
90:17 愿主我们　神的荣美、归于我们身上。愿你坚立我们手所作的工。我们手所作的工、愿你坚立。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 91章    

91:1 住在至高者隐密处的、必住在全能者的荫下。  
91:2 我要论到耶和华说、他是我的避难所、是我的山寨、是我的　神、是我所倚靠的。  
91:3 他必救你脱离捕鸟人的网罗、和毒害的瘟疫。  
91:4 他必用自己的翎毛遮蔽你。你要投靠在他的翅膀底下。他的诚实、是大小的盾牌。  
91:5 你必不怕黑夜的惊骇、或是白日飞的箭。  

91:6 也不怕黑夜行的瘟疫、或是午间灭人的毒病。  
91:7 虽有千人仆倒在你旁边、万人仆倒在你右边、这灾却不得临近你。  
91:8 你惟亲眼观看、见恶人遭报。  
91:9 耶和华是我的避难所。你已将至高者当你的居所。  
91:10 祸患必不临到你、灾害也不挨近你的帐棚。  

91:11 因他要为你吩咐他的使者、在你行的一切道路上保护你。  
91:12 他们要用手托着你、免得你的脚碰在石头上。  
91:13 你要踹在狮子和虺蛇的身上、践踏少壮狮子和大蛇。  
91:14 　神说、因为他专心爱我、我就要搭救他。因为他知道我的名、我要把他安置在高处。  
91:15 他若求告我、我就应允他。他在急难中、我要与他同在。我要搭救他、使他尊贵。  

91:16 我要使他足享长寿、将我的救恩显明给他。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 92章    

92:1 〔安息日的诗歌。〕称谢耶和华、歌颂你至高者的名。  
92:2 用十弦的乐器和瑟、用琴弹幽雅的声音、早晨传扬你的慈爱、每夜传扬你的信实、这本为美事。  
92:3 见上节
92:4 因你耶和华借着你的作为叫我高兴。我要因你手的工作欢呼。  
92:5 耶和华阿、你的工作何其大、你的心思极其深。  

92:6 畜类人不晓得、愚顽人也不明白。  
92:7 恶人茂盛如草、一切作孽之人发旺的时候、正是他们要灭亡、直到永远。  
92:8 惟你耶和华是至高、直到永远。  
92:9 耶和华阿、你的仇敌都要灭亡、一切作孽的也要离散。  
92:10 你却高举了我的角、如野牛的角。我是被新油膏了的。  

92:11 我眼睛看见仇敌遭报、我耳朵听见那些起来攻击我的恶人受罚。  
92:12 义人要发旺如棕树、生长如利巴嫩的香柏树。  
92:13 他们栽于耶和华的殿中、发旺在我们　神的院里。  
92:14 他们年老的时候、仍要结果子。要满了汁浆而常发青。  
92:15 好显明耶和华是正直的、他是我的磐石、在他毫无不义。  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 93章   

93:1 耶和华作王。他以威严为衣穿上。耶和华以能力为衣、以能力束腰。世界就坚定、不得动摇。  
93:2 你的宝座从太初立定。你从亘古就有。  
93:3 耶和华阿、大水扬起、大水发声、波浪澎湃。  
93:4 耶和华在高处大有能力、胜过诸水的响声、洋海的大浪。  
93:5 耶和华阿、你的法度最的确。你的殿永称为圣、是合宜的。  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 94章     

94:1 耶和华阿、你是伸冤的　神。伸冤的　神阿、求你发出光来。  
94:2 审判世界的主阿、求你挺身而立、使骄傲人受应得的报应。  
94:3 耶和华阿、恶人夸胜要到几时呢、要到几时呢。  
94:4 他们絮絮叨叨、说傲慢的话。一切作孽的人、都自己夸张。  
94:5 耶和华阿、他们强压你的百姓、苦害你的产业。  

94:6 他们杀死寡妇和寄居的、又杀害孤儿。  
94:7 他们说、耶和华必不看见、雅各的　神必不思念。  
94:8 你们民间的畜类人当思想。你们愚顽人、到几时才有智慧呢。  
94:9 造耳朵的、难道自己不听见么。造眼睛的、难道自己不看见么。  
94:10 管教列邦的、就是叫人得知识的、难道自己不惩治人么。  

94:11 耶和华知道人的意念是虚妄的。  
94:12 耶和华阿、你所管教、用律法所教训的人、是有福的。  
94:13 你使他在遭难的日子、得享平安。惟有恶人陷在所挖的坑中。  
94:14 因为耶和华必不丢弃他的百姓、也不离弃他的产业。  
94:15 审判要转向公义。心里正直的、必都随从。  

94:16 谁肯为我起来攻击作恶的。谁肯为我站起抵挡作孽的。  
94:17 若不是耶和华帮助我、我就住在寂静之中了。  
94:18 我正说我失了脚、耶和华阿、那时你的慈爱扶助我。  
94:19 我心里多忧多疑、你安慰我、就使我欢乐。  
94:20 那借着律例架弄残害、在位上行奸恶的、岂能与你相交么。  

94:21 他们大家聚集攻击义人、将无辜的人定为死罪。  
94:22 但耶和华向来作了我的高台。我的　神作了我投靠的磐石。  
94:23 他叫他们的罪孽归到他们身上。他们正在行恶之中、他要剪除他们。耶和华我们的　神要把他们剪除。

诗篇 95章   

95:1 来阿、我们要向耶和华歌唱、向拯救我们的磐石欢呼。  
95:2 我们要来感谢他、用诗歌向他欢呼。  
95:3 因耶和华为大　神、为大王、超乎万神之上。  
95:4 地的深处在他手中。山的高峰也属他。  
95:5 海洋属他。是他造的。旱地也是他手造成的。  

95:6 来阿、我们要屈身敬拜、在造我们的耶和华面前跪下。  
95:7 因为他是我们的　神。我们是他草场的羊、是他手下的民。惟愿你们今天听他的话。  
95:8 你们不可硬着心、像当日在米利巴、就是在旷野的玛撒。  
95:9 那时你们的祖宗试我探我、并且观看我的作为。  
95:10 四十年之久、我厌烦那世代、说、这是心里迷糊的百姓、竟不晓得我的作为。  

95:11 所以我在怒中起誓、说、他们断不可进入我的安息。

101:2 我要用智慧行完全的道。你几时到我这里来呢。我要存完全的心、行在我家中。  
101:3 邪僻的事、我都不摆在我眼前。悖逆人所作的事、我甚恨恶、不容沾在我身上。  
101:4 弯曲的心思、我必远离。一切的恶人、〔或作恶事〕我不认识。  
101:5 在暗中谗谤他邻居的、我必将他灭绝。眼目高傲、心里骄纵的、我必不容他。  

101:6 我眼要看国中的诚实人、叫他们与我同住。行为完全的、他要伺候我。  
101:7 行诡诈的、必不得住在我家里。说谎话的、必不得立在我眼前。

------------------------------------------

诗篇 102章      

102:1 〔困苦人发昏的时候、在耶和华面前吐露苦情的祷告。〕耶和华阿、求你听我的祷告、容我的呼求达到你面前。  
102:2 我在急难的日子、求你向我侧耳、不要向我掩面。我呼求的日子、求你快快应允我。  
102:3 因为我的年日、如烟云消灭、我的骨头、如火把烧着。  
102:4 我的心被伤、如草枯干、甚至我忘记吃饭。  
102:5 因我唉哼的声音、我的肉紧贴骨头。  

102:6 我如同旷野的鹈鹕。我好像荒场的鸮鸟。  
102:7 我儆醒不睡。我像房顶上孤单的麻雀。  
102:8 我的仇敌终日辱骂我。向我猖狂的人、指着我赌咒。  
102:9 我吃过炉灰、如同吃饭。我所喝的与眼泪搀杂。  
102:10 这都因你的恼恨和忿怒。你把我拾起来、又把我摔下去。  

102:11 我的年日、如日影偏斜。我也如草枯干。  
102:12 惟你耶和华必存到永远。你可记念的名、也存到万代。  
102:13 你必起来怜恤锡安、因现在是可怜他的时候。日期已经到了。  
102:14 你的仆人原来喜悦他的石头、可怜他的尘土。  
102:15 列国要敬畏耶和华的名。世上诸王都敬畏你的荣耀。  

102:16 因为耶和华建造了锡安、在他荣耀里显现。  
102:17 他垂听穷人的祷告、并不藐视他们的祈求。  
102:18 这必为后代的人记下。将来受造的民、要赞美耶和华。  
102:19 因为他从至高的圣所垂看。耶和华从天向地观察。  
102:20 要垂听被囚之人的叹息。要释放将要死的人。  

102:21 使人在锡安传扬耶和华的名、在耶路撒冷传扬赞美他的话。  
102:22 就是在万民和列国聚会事奉耶和华的时候。  
102:23 他使我的力量、中道衰弱、使我的年日短少。  
102:24 我说、我的　神阿、不要使我中年去世。你的年数、世世无穷。  
102:25 你起初立了地的根基。天也是你手所造的。  

102:26 天地都要灭没、你却要长存。天地都要如外衣渐渐旧了。你要将天地如里衣更换、天地就改变了。  
102:27 惟有你永不改变。你的年数没有穷尽。  
102:28 你仆人的子孙要长存。他们的后裔、要坚立在你面前。

诗篇 103章

103:2 我的心哪、你要称颂耶和华、不可忘记他的一切恩惠。  
103:3 他赦免你的一切罪孽、医治你的一切疾病。  
103:4 他救赎你的命脱离死亡、以仁爱和慈悲为你的冠冕。  
103:5 他用美物、使你所愿的得以知足、以致你如鹰返老还童。  

103:6 耶和华施行公义、为一切受屈的人伸冤。  
103:7 他使摩西知道他的法则、叫以色列人晓得他的作为。  
103:8 耶和华有怜悯、有恩典、不轻易发怒、且有丰盛的慈爱。  
103:9 他不长久责备、也不永远怀怒。  
103:10 他没有按我们的罪过待我们、也没有照我们的罪孽报应我们。  

103:11 天离地何等的高、他的慈爱向敬畏他的人、也是何等的大。  
103:12 东离西有多远、他叫我们的过犯、离我们也有多远。  
103:13 父亲怎样怜恤他的儿女、耶和华也怎样怜恤敬畏他的人。  
103:14 因为他知道我们的本体、思念我们不过是尘土。  
103:15 至于世人、他的年日如草一样。他发旺如野地的花。  

103:16 经风一吹、便归无有。他的原处、也不再认识他。  
103:17 但耶和华的慈爱、归于敬畏他的人、从亘古到永远。他的公义、也归于子子孙孙。  
103:18 就是那些遵守他的约、记念他的训词而遵行的人。  
103:19 耶和华在天上立定宝座。他的权柄〔原文作国〕统管万有。  
103:20 听从他命令成全他旨意有大能的天使、都要称颂耶和华。  

103:21 你们作他的诸军作他的仆役行他所喜悦的、都要称颂耶和华。  
103:22 你们一切被他造的、在他所治理的各处、都要称颂耶和华。我的心哪、你要称颂耶和华。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 104章       

104:1 我的心哪、你要称颂耶和华。耶和华我的　神阿、你为至大。你以尊荣威严为衣服。  
104:2 披上亮光、如披外袍。铺张穹苍、如铺幔子。  
104:3 在水中立楼阁的栋梁、用云彩为车辇、借着风的翅膀而行。  
104:4 以风为使者、以火焰为仆役。  
104:5 将地立在根基上、使地永不动摇。  

104:6 你用深水遮盖地面、犹如衣裳。诸水高过山岭。  
104:7 你的斥责一发、水便奔逃。你的雷声一发、水便奔流。  
104:8 （诸山升上、诸谷沉下。〔或作随山上翻随谷下流〕)归你为他所安定之地。  
104:9 你定了界限、使水不能过去、不再转回遮盖地面。  
104:10 耶和华使泉源涌在山谷、流在山间。  

104:11 使野地的走兽有水喝。野驴得解其渴。  
104:12 天上的飞鸟在水旁住宿、在树枝上啼叫。  
104:13 他从楼阁中浇灌山岭。因他作为的功效、地就丰足。  
104:14 他使草生长、给六畜吃。使菜蔬发长、供给人用。使人从地里能得食物。  
104:15 又得酒能悦人心、得油能润人面、得粮能养人心。  

104:16 佳美的树木、就是利巴嫩的香柏树、是耶和华所栽种的、都满了汁浆。  
104:17 雀鸟在其上搭窝。至于鹤、松树是他的房屋。  
104:18 高山为野山羊的住所。岩石为沙番的藏处。  
104:19 你安置月亮为定节令。日头自知沉落。  
104:20 你造黑暗为夜、林中的百兽就都爬出来。  

104:21 少壮狮子吼叫、要抓食、向　神寻求食物。  
104:22 日头一出、兽便躲避、卧在洞里。  
104:23 人出去作工、劳碌直到晚上。  
104:24 耶和华阿、你所造的何其多、都是你用智慧造成的。遍地满了你的丰富。  
104:25 那里有海、又大又广。其中有无数的动物。大小活物都有。  

104:26 那里有船行走。有你所造的鳄鱼、游泳在其中。  
104:27 这都仰望你按时给他食物。  
104:28 你给他们、他们便拾起来。你张手、他们饱得美食。  
104:29 你掩面、他们便惊惶。你收回他们的气、他们就死亡归于尘土。  
104:30 你发出你的灵、他们便受造。你使地面更换为新。  

104:31 愿耶和华的荣耀存到永远。愿耶和华喜悦自己所造的。  
104:32 他看地、地便震动。他摸山、山就冒烟。  
104:33 我要一生向耶和华唱诗。我还活的时候、要向我　神歌颂。  
104:34 愿他以我的默念为甘甜。我要因耶和华欢喜。  
104:35 愿罪人从世上消灭。愿恶人归于无有。我的心哪、要称颂耶和华。你们要赞美耶和华。〔原文作哈利路亚下同〕  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 105章       

105:1 你们要称谢耶和华、求告他的名、在万民中传扬他的作为。  
105:2 要向他唱诗歌颂、谈论他一切奇妙的作为。  
105:3 要以他的圣名夸耀。寻求耶和华的人、心中应当欢喜。  
105:4 要寻求耶和华与他的能力、时常寻求他的面。  
105:5 他仆人亚伯拉罕的后裔、他所拣选雅各的子孙哪、你们要记念他奇妙的作为、和他的奇事、并他口中的判语。  

105:6 见上节
105:7 他是耶和华我们的　神。全地都有他的判断。  
105:8 他记念他的约、直到永远、他所吩咐的话、直到千代、  
105:9 就是与亚伯拉罕所立的约、向以撒所起的誓。  
105:10 他又将这约向雅各定为律例、向以色列定为永远的约、  

105:11 说、我必将迦南地赐给你、作你产业的分。  
105:12 当时他们人丁有限、数目稀少、并且在那地为寄居的。  
105:13 他们从这邦游到那邦、从这国行到那国。  
105:14 他不容甚么人欺负他们、为他们的缘故、责备君王、  
105:15 说、不可难为我受膏的人、也不可恶待我的先知。  

105:16 他命饥荒降在那地上、将所倚靠的粮食、全行断绝。  
105:17 在他们以先打发一个人去。约瑟被卖为奴仆。  
105:18 人用脚镣伤他的脚。他被铁链捆拘。  
105:19 耶和华的话试炼他、直等到他所说的应验了。  
105:20 王打发人把他解开、就是治理众民的、把他释放。  

105:21 立他作王家之主、掌管他一切所有的。  
105:22 使他随意捆绑他的臣宰、将智慧教导他的长老。  
105:23 以色列也到了埃及、雅各在含地寄居。  
105:24 耶和华使他的百姓生养众多、使他们比敌人强盛。  
105:25 使敌人的心转去恨他的百姓、并用诡计待他的仆人。  

105:26 他打发他的仆人摩西、和他所拣选的亚伦。  
105:27 在敌人中间显他的神迹在含地显他的奇事。  
105:28 他命黑暗、就有黑暗。没有违背他话的。  
105:29 他叫埃及的水变为血、叫他们的鱼死了。  
105:30 在他们的地上、以及王宫的内室、青蛙多多滋生。  

105:31 他说一声、苍蝇就成群而来、并有虱子进入他们四境。  
105:32 他给他们降下冰雹为雨、在他们的地上降下火焰。  
105:33 他也击打他们的葡萄树、和无花果树、毁坏他们境内的树木。  
105:34 他说一声、就有蝗虫蚂蚱上来、不计其数、  
105:35 吃尽了他们地上各样的菜蔬、和田地的出产。  

105:36 他又击杀他们国内一切的长子、就是他们强壮时头生的。  
105:37 他领自己的百姓带银子金子出来。他支派中没有一个软弱的。  
105:38 他们出来的时候、埃及人便欢喜。原来埃及人惧怕他们。  
105:39 他铺张云彩当遮盖、夜间使火光照。  
105:40 他们一求、他就使鹌鹑飞来、并用天上的粮食、叫他们饱足。  

105:41 他打开磐石、水就涌出。在干旱之处、水流成河。  
105:42 这都因他记念他的圣言、和他的仆人亚伯拉罕。  
105:43 他带领百姓欢乐而出、带领选民欢呼前往。  
105:44 他将列国的地赐给他们、他们便承受众民劳碌得来的。  
105:45 好使他们遵他的律例、守他的律法。你们要赞美耶和华。  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 106章      

106:1 你们要赞美耶和华。要称谢耶和华、因他本为善。他的慈爱永远长存。  
106:2 谁能传说耶和华的大能、谁能表明他一切的美德。  
106:3 凡遵守公平、常行公义的、这人便为有福。  
106:4 耶和华阿、你用恩惠待你的百姓、求你也用这恩惠记念我、开你的救恩眷顾我、  
106:5 使我见你选民的福、乐你国民的乐、与你的产业一同夸耀。  

106:6 我们与我们的祖宗一同犯罪。我们作了孽、行了恶。  
106:7 我们的祖宗在埃及不明白你的奇事、不记念你丰盛的慈爱、反倒在红海行了悖逆。  
106:8 然而他因自己的名拯救他们、为要彰显他的大能。  
106:9 并且斥责红海、海便干了。他带领他们经过深处、如同经过旷野。  
106:10 他拯救他们脱离恨他们人的手、从仇敌手中救赎他们。  

106:11 水淹没他们的敌人、没有一个存留。  
106:12 那时他们才信了他的话、歌唱赞美他。  
106:13 等不多时、他们就忘了他的作为、不仰望他的指教、  
106:14 反倒在旷野大起欲心、在荒地试探　神。  
106:15 他将他们所求的赐给他们、却使他们的心灵软弱。  

106:16 他们又在营中嫉妒摩西、和耶和华的圣者亚伦。  
106:17 地裂开吞下大坍、掩盖亚比兰一党的人。  
106:18 有火在他们的党中发起、有火焰烧毁了恶人。  
106:19 他们在何烈山造了牛犊叩拜铸成的像。  
106:20 如此将他们荣耀的主、换为吃草之牛的像。  

106:21 忘了　神他们的救主。他曾在埃及行大事、  
106:22 在含地行奇事、在红海行可畏的事。  
106:23 所以他说要灭绝他们。若非有他所拣选的摩西站在当中、〔原文作破口〕使他的忿怒转消、恐怕他就灭绝他们。  
106:24 他们又藐视那美地、不信他的话、  
106:25 在自己帐棚内发怨言、不听耶和华的声音。  

106:26 所以他对他们起誓、必叫他们倒在旷野、  
106:27 叫他们的后裔倒在列国之中、分散在各地。  
106:28 他们又与巴力毗珥连合、且吃了祭死神〔或作人〕的物。  
106:29 他们这样行、惹耶和华发怒、便有瘟疫流行在他们中间。  
106:30 那时非尼哈站起、刑罚恶人。瘟疫这才止息。  

106:31 那就算为他的义、世世代代直到永远。  
106:32 他们在米利巴水又叫耶和华发怒、甚至摩西也受了亏损。  
106:33 是因他们惹动他的灵。摩西〔原文作他〕用嘴说了急躁的话。  
106:34 他们不照耶和华所吩咐的灭绝外邦人、  
106:35 反与他们混杂相合、学习他们的行为、  

106:36 事奉他们的偶像。这就成了自己的网罗。  
106:37 把自己的儿女祭祀鬼魔、  
106:38 流无辜人的血、就是自己儿女的血、把他们祭祀迦南的偶像。那地就被血污秽了。  
106:39 这样他们被自己所作的污秽了、在行为上犯了邪淫。  
106:40 所以耶和华的怒气、向他的百姓发作、憎恶他的产业。  

106:41 将他们交在外邦人的手里。恨他们的人就辖制他们。  
106:42 他们的仇敌也欺压他们、他们就伏在敌人手下。  
106:43 他屡次搭救他们、他们却设谋背逆。因自己的罪孽降为卑下。  
106:44 然而他听见他们哀告的时候、就眷顾他们的急难。  
106:45 为他们记念他的约、照他丰盛的慈爱后悔。  

106:46 他也使他们在凡掳掠他们的人面前蒙怜恤。  
106:47 耶和华我们的　神阿、求你拯救我们、从外邦中招聚我们、我们好称赞你的圣名、以赞美你为夸胜。  
106:48 耶和华以色列的　神、是应当称颂的、从亘古直到永远。愿众民都说、阿们。你们要赞美耶和华。

诗篇 107章       

107:1 你们要称谢耶和华、因他本为善。他的慈爱、永远长存。  
107:2 愿耶和华的赎民说这话、就是他从敌人手中所救赎的、  
107:3 从各地、从东从西、从南从北、所招聚来的。  
107:4 他们在旷野荒地漂流、寻不见可住的城邑。  
107:5 又饥又渴、心里发昏。  

107:6 于是他们在苦难中哀求耶和华、他从他们的祸患中搭救他们。  
107:7 又领他们行走直路、使他们往可居住的城邑。  
107:8 但愿人因耶和华的慈爱、和他向人所行的奇事、都称赞他。  
107:9 因他使心里渴慕的人、得以知足、使心里饥饿的人、得饱美物。  
107:10 那些坐在黑暗中死荫里的人、被困苦和铁链捆锁、  

107:11 是因他们违背　神的话语、藐视至高者的旨意。  
107:12 所以他用劳苦治服他们的心。他们仆倒、无人扶助。  
107:13 于是他们在苦难中哀求耶和华、他从他们的祸患中拯救他们。  
107:14 他从黑暗中、和死荫里、领他们出来、折断他们的绑索。  
107:15 但愿人因耶和华的慈爱、和他向人所行的奇事、都称赞他。  

107:16 因为他打破了铜门、砍断了铁闩。  
107:17 愚妄人因自己的过犯、和自己的罪孽、便受苦楚。  
107:18 他们心里厌恶各样的食物、就临近死门。  
107:19 于是他们在苦难中哀求耶和华、他从他们的祸患中、拯救他们。  
107:20 他发命医治他们、救他们脱离死亡。  

107:21 但愿人因耶和华的慈爱、和他向人所行的奇事、都称赞他。  
107:22 愿他们以感谢为祭献给他、欢呼述说他的作为。  
107:23 在海上坐船、在大水中经理事务的。  
107:24 他们看见耶和华的作为、并他在深水中的奇事。  
107:25 因他一吩咐、狂风就起来、海中的波浪也扬起。  

107:26 他们上到天空、下到海底、他们的心因患难便消化。  
107:27 他们摇摇幌幌、东倒西歪、好像醉酒的人。他们的智慧无法可施。  
107:28 于是他们在苦难中哀求耶和华、他从他们的祸患中领出他们来。  
107:29 他使狂风止息、波浪就平静。  
107:30 风息浪静。他们便欢喜。他就引他们到所愿去的海口。  

107:31 但愿人因耶和华的慈爱、和他向人所行的奇事、都称赞他。  
107:32 愿他们在民的会中尊崇他、在长老的位上赞美他。  
107:33 他使江河变为旷野、叫水泉变为干渴之地。  
107:34 使肥地变为碱地。这都因其间居民的罪恶。  
107:35 他使旷野变为水潭、叫旱地变为水泉。  

107:36 他使饥饿的人住在那里、好建造可住的城邑。  
107:37 又种田地、栽葡萄园、得享所出的土产。  
107:38 他又赐福给他们、叫他们生养众多。也不叫他们的牲畜减少。  
107:39 他们又因暴虐、患难、愁苦、就减少且卑下。  
107:40 他使君王蒙羞被辱、使他们在荒废无路之地漂流。  

107:41 他却将穷乏人安置在高处、脱离苦难、使他的家属多如羊群。  
107:42 正直人看见、就欢喜。罪孽之辈、必塞口无言。  
107:43 凡有智慧的、必在这些事上留心。也必思想耶和华的慈爱。

108:2 琴瑟阿、你们当醒起。我自己要极早醒起。  
108:3 耶和华阿、我要在万民中称谢你、在列邦中歌颂你。  
108:4 因为你的慈爱大过诸天。你的诚实达到穹苍。  
108:5 　神阿、愿你崇高、过于诸天。愿你的荣耀、高过全地。  

108:6 求你应允我们、用右手拯救我们、好叫你所亲爱的人得救。  
108:7 　神已经指着他的圣洁说、〔说或作应许我〕我要欢乐。我要分开示剑、丈量疏割谷。  
108:8 基列是我的。玛拿西是我的。以法莲是护卫我头的。犹大是我的杖。  
108:9 摩押是我的沐浴盆。我要向以东抛鞋。我必因胜非利士呼喊。  
108:10 谁能领我进坚固城。谁能引我到以东地。  

108:11 　神阿、你不是丢弃了我们么。　神阿、你不和我们的军兵同去么。  
108:12 求你帮助我们攻击敌人、因为人的帮助是枉然的。  
108:13 我们倚靠　神、才得施展大能、因为践踏我们敌人的就是他。

诗篇 109章       

109:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕我所赞美的　神阿、求你不要闭口不言。  
109:2 因为恶人的嘴、和诡诈人的口、已经张开攻击我。他们用撒谎的舌头对我说话。  
109:3 他们围绕我、说怨恨的话、又无故地攻打我。  
109:4 他们与我为敌以报我爱。但我专心祈祷。  
109:5 他们向我以恶报善、以恨报爱。  

109:6 愿你派一个恶人辖制他、派一个对头站在他右边。  
109:7 他受审判的时候、愿他出来担当罪名。愿他的祈祷、反成为罪。  
109:8 愿他的年日短少。愿别人得他的职分。  
109:9 愿他的儿女为孤儿、他的妻子为寡妇。  
109:10 愿他的儿女漂流讨饭、从他们荒凉之处出来求食。  

109:11 愿强暴的债主牢笼他一切所有的。愿外人抢他劳碌得来的。  
109:12 愿无人向他延绵施恩。愿无人可怜他的孤儿。  
109:13 愿他的后人断绝、名字被涂抹、不传于下代。  
109:14 愿他祖宗的罪孽被耶和华记念。愿他母亲的罪过不被涂抹。  
109:15 愿这些罪常在耶和华面前、使他的名号断绝于世。  

109:16 因为他不想施恩、却逼迫困苦穷乏的、和伤心的人、要把他们治死。  
109:17 他爱咒骂、咒骂就临到他。他不喜爱福乐、福乐就与他远离。  
109:18 他拿咒骂当衣服穿上。这咒骂就如水进他里面、像油入他的骨头。  
109:19 愿这咒骂当他遮身的衣服、当他常束的腰带。  
109:20 这就是我对头、和用恶言议论我的人、从耶和华那里所受的报应。  

109:21 主耶和华阿、求你为你的名恩待我。因你的慈爱美好、求你搭救我。  
109:22 因为我困苦穷乏、内心受伤。  
109:23 我如日影渐渐偏斜而去。我如蝗虫被抖出来。  
109:24 我因禁食、膝骨软弱。我身上的肉、也渐渐瘦了。  
109:25 我受他们的羞辱。他们看见我、便摇头。  

109:26 耶和华我的　神阿、求你帮助我、照你的慈爱拯救我。  
109:27 使他们知道这是你的手、是你耶和华所行的事。  
109:28 任凭他们咒骂。惟愿你赐福。他们几时起来、就必蒙羞。你的仆人却要欢喜。  
109:29 愿我的对头、披戴羞辱。愿他们以自己的羞愧为外袍遮身。  
109:30 我要用口极力称谢耶和华。我要在众人中间赞美他。  

109:31 因为他必站在穷乏人的右边、要救他脱离审判他灵魂的人。

诗篇 110章   

110:1 〔大卫的诗。〕耶和华对我主说、你坐在我的右边、等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。  
110:2 耶和华必使你从锡安伸出能力的杖来。你要在你仇敌中掌权。  
110:3 当你掌权的日子、〔或作行军的日子〕你的民要以圣洁的妆饰为衣、〔或作以圣洁为妆饰〕甘心牺牲自己。你的民多如清晨的甘露。〔或作你少年时光耀如清晨的甘露〕  
110:4 耶和华起了誓、决不后悔、说、你是照着麦基洗德的等次、永远为祭司。  
110:5 在你右边的主、当他发怒的日子、必打伤列王。  

110:6 他要在列邦中刑罚恶人、尸首就遍满各处。他要在许多国中打破仇敌的头。  
110:7 他要喝路旁的河水。因此必抬起头来。

119:108 耶和华阿、求你悦纳我口中的赞美为供物、又将你的典章教训我。  
119:109 我的性命常在危险之中、我却不忘记你的律法。  
119:110 恶人为我设下网罗。我却没有偏离你的训词。  

119:111 我以你的法度为永远的产业。因这是我心中所喜爱的。  
119:112 我的心专向你的律例、永远遵行、一直到底。  
119:113 心怀二意的人、为我所恨。但你的律法、为我所爱。

119:115 作恶的人哪、你们离开我吧、我好遵守我　神的命令。  

119:116 求你照你的话扶持我、使我存活。也不叫我因失望而害羞。  
119:117 求你扶持我、我便得救、时常看重你的律例。  
119:118 凡偏离你律例的人、你都轻弃他们。因为他们的诡诈必归虚空。  
119:119 凡地上的恶人、你除掉他好像除掉渣滓。因此我爱你的法度。  
119:120 我因惧怕你、肉就发抖。我也怕你的判语、  

119:121 我行过公平和公义。求你不要撇下我给欺压我的人。  
119:122 求你为仆人作保、使我得好处。不容骄傲人欺压我。  
119:123 我因盼望你的救恩、和你公义的话、眼睛失明。  
119:124 求你照你的慈爱待仆人、将你的律例教训我。  
119:125 我是你的仆人。求你赐我悟性、使我得知你的法度。  

119:126 这是耶和华降罚的时候。因人废了你的律法。  
119:127 所以我爱你的命令、胜于金子、更胜于精金。  
119:128 你一切的训词、在万事上、我都以为正直。我却恨恶一切假道。  
119:129 你的法度奇妙。所以我一心谨守。  
119:130 你的言语一解开、就发出亮光、使愚人通达。  

119:131 我张口而气喘。因我切慕你的命令。

119:138 你所命定的法度、是凭公义和至诚。  
119:139 我心焦急、如同火烧、因我敌人忘记你的言语。  
119:140 你的话极其精炼。所以你的仆人喜爱。  

119:141 我微小被人藐视。却不忘记你的训词。  
119:142 你的公义永远长存。你的律法尽都真实。  
119:143 我遭遇患难愁苦。你的命令却是我所喜爱的。

119:149 求你照你的慈爱、听我的声音。耶和华阿、求你照你的典章、将我救活。  
119:150 追求奸恶的人临近了。他们远离你的律法。

119:160 你话的总纲是真实。你一切公义的典章是永远长存。  

119:161 首领无故地逼迫我。但我的心畏惧你的言语。  
119:162 我喜爱你的话、好像人得了许多掳物。  
119:163 谎话是我所恨恶所憎嫌的、惟你的律法、是我所爱的。  
119:164 我因你公义的典章、一天七次赞美你。

138:6 耶和华虽高、仍看顾低微的人。他却从远处看出骄傲的人。  
138:7 我虽行在患难中、你必将我救活。我的仇敌发怒、你必伸手抵挡他们、你的右手也必救我。  
138:8 耶和华必成全关乎我的事。耶和华阿、你的慈爱永远长存。求你不要离弃你手所造的。

诗篇 139章     

139:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕耶和华阿、你已经鉴察我、认识我。  
139:2 我坐下、我起来、你都晓得。你从远处知道我的意念。  
139:3 我行路、我躺卧、你都细察、你也深知我一切所行的。  
139:4 耶和华阿、我舌头上的话、你没有一句不知道的。  
139:5 你在我前后环绕我、按手在我身上。  

139:6 这样的知识奇妙、是我不能测的。至高、是我不能及的。  
139:7 我往那里去躲避你的灵。我往那里逃躲避你的面。  
139:8 我若升到天上、你在那里。我若在阴间下榻、你也在那里。  
139:9 我若展开清晨的翅膀、飞到海极居住。  
139:10 就是在那里、你的手必引导我。你的右手、也必扶持我。  

139:11 我若说、黑暗必定遮蔽我、我周围的亮光必成为黑夜。  
139:12 黑暗也不能遮蔽我使你不见、黑夜却如白昼发亮。黑暗和光明、在你看都是一样。  
139:13 我的肺腑是你所造的。我在母腹中、你已覆庇我。  
139:14 我要称谢你、因我受造奇妙可畏。你的作为奇妙。这是我心深知道的。  
139:15 我在暗中受造、在地的深处被联络、那时、我的形体并不向你隐藏。  

139:16 我未成形的体质、你的眼早已看见了。你所定的日子、我尚未度一日、〔或作我被造的肢体尚未有其一〕你都写在你的册上了。  
139:17 　神阿、你的意念向我何等宝贵。其数何等众多。  
139:18 我若数点、比海沙更多。我睡醒的时候、仍和你同在。  
139:19 　神阿、你必要杀戮恶人。所以你们好流人血的、离开我去吧。  
139:20 因为他们说恶言顶撞你、你的仇敌也妄称你的名。  

139:21 耶和华阿、恨恶你的、我岂不恨恶他们么。攻击你的、我岂不憎嫌他们么。  
139:22 我切切的恨恶他们、以他们为仇敌。  
139:23 　神阿、求你鉴察我、知道我的心思、试炼我、知道我的意念。  
139:24 看在我里面有甚么恶行没有、引导我走永生的道路。

诗篇 140章    

140:1 〔大卫的诗、交与伶长。〕耶和华阿、求你拯救我脱离凶恶的人、保护我脱离强暴的人。  
140:2 他们心中图谋奸恶、常常聚集要争战。  
140:3 他们使舌头尖利如蛇。嘴里有虺蛇的毒气。〔细拉〕  
140:4 耶和华阿、求你拯救我、脱离恶人的手、保护我、脱离强暴的人。他们图谋推我跌倒。  
140:5 骄傲人为我暗设网罗和绳索。他们在路旁铺下网、设下圈套。〔细拉〕  

140:6 我曾对耶和华说、你是我的　神。耶和华阿、求你留心听我恳求的声音。  
140:7 主耶和华、我救恩的力量阿、在争战的日子、你遮蔽了我的头。  
140:8 耶和华阿、求你不要遂恶人的心愿。不要成就他们的计谋、恐怕他们自高。〔细拉〕  
140:9 至于那些昂首围困我的人、愿他们嘴唇的奸恶、陷害〔原文作遮蔽〕自己。  
140:10 愿火炭落在他们身上。愿他们被丢在火中、抛在深坑里、不能再起来。  

140:11 说恶言的人、在地上必坚立不住。祸患必猎取强暴的人、将他打倒。  
140:12 我知道耶和华必为困苦人伸冤、必为穷乏人辨屈。  
140:13 义人必要称赞你的名。正直人必住在你面前。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 141章   

141:1 〔大卫的诗。〕耶和华阿、我曾求告你。求你快快临到我这里。我求告你的时候、愿你留心听我的声音。  
141:2 愿我的祷告、如香陈列在你面前。愿我举手祈求、如献晚祭。  
141:3 耶和华阿、求你禁止我的口、把守我的嘴。  
141:4 求你不叫我的心、偏向邪恶、以致我和作孽的人同行恶事。也不叫我吃他们的美食。  
141:5 任凭义人击打我、这算为仁慈。任凭他责备我、这算为头上的膏油。我的头不要躲闪。正在他们行恶的时候、我仍要祈祷。  

141:6 他们的审判官、被扔在岩下。众人要听我的话、因为这话甘甜。  
141:7 我们的骨头、散在墓旁、好像人耕田、刨地的土块。  
141:8 主耶和华阿、我的眼目仰望你。我投靠你、求你不要将我撇得孤苦。  
141:9 求你保护我脱离恶人为我设的网罗、和作孽之人的圈套。  
141:10 愿恶人落在自己的网里。我却得以逃脱。  


------------------------------------------

诗篇 142章   

142:1 〔大卫在洞里作的训诲诗、乃是祈祷。〕我发声哀告耶和华。发声恳求耶和华。  
142:2 我在他面前吐露我的苦情。陈说我的患难。  
142:3 我的灵在我里面发昏的时候、你知道我的道路。在我行的路上、敌人为我暗设网罗。  
142:4 求你向我右边观看、因为没有人认识我。我无处避难、也没有人眷顾我。  
142:5 耶和华阿、我曾向你哀求。我说、你是我的避难所。在活人之地、你是我的福分。  

142:6 求你侧耳听我的呼求、因我落到极卑之地。求你救我脱离逼迫我的人、因为他们比我强盛。  
142:7 求你领我出离被囚之地、我好称赞你的名。义人必环绕我、因为你是用厚恩待我。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 143章   

143:1 〔大卫的诗。〕耶和华阿、求你听我的祷告、留心听我的恳求、凭你的信实和公义应允我。  
143:2 求你不要审问仆人。因为在你面前凡活着的人、没有一个是义的。  
143:3 原来仇敌逼迫我、将我打倒在地。使我住在幽暗之处、像死了许久的人一样。  
143:4 所以我的灵在我里面发昏。我的心在我里面凄惨。  
143:5 我追想古时之日、思想你的一切作为、默念你手的工作。  

143:6 我向你举手我的心渴想你、如干旱之地盼雨一样。〔细拉〕  
143:7 耶和华阿、求你速速应允我。我心神耗尽。不要向我掩面、免得我像那些下坑的人一样。  
143:8 求你使我清晨得听你慈爱之言、因我倚靠你。求你使我知道当行的路、因我的心仰望你。  
143:9 耶和华阿、求你救我脱离我的仇敌。我往你那里藏身。  
143:10 求你指教我遵行你的旨意、因你是我的　神。你的灵本为善。求你引我到平坦之地。  

143:11 耶和华阿、求你为你的名将我救活。凭你的公义、将我从患难中领出来。  
143:12 凭你的慈爱剪除我的仇敌、灭绝一切苦待我的人。因我是你的仆人。  

------------------------------------------

诗篇 144章    

144:1 〔大卫的诗。〕耶和华我的磐石、是应当称颂的。他教导我的手争战、教导我的指头打仗。  
144:2 他是我慈爱的主、我的山寨、我的高台、我的救主、我的盾牌、是我所投靠的。他使我的百姓服在我以下。  
144:3 耶和华阿、人算甚么、你竟认识他。世人算甚么、你竟顾念他。  
144:4 人好像一口气。他的年日如同影儿快快过去。  
144:5 耶和华阿、求你使天下垂、亲自降临。摸山、山就冒烟。  

144:6 求你发出闪电、使他们四散。射出你的箭、使他们扰乱。  
144:7 求你从上伸手救拔我、救我出离大水、救我脱离外邦人的手。  
144:8 他们的口说谎话、他们的右手起假誓。  
144:9 　神阿、我要向你唱新歌。用十弦瑟向你歌颂。  
144:10 你是那拯救君王的。你是那救仆人大卫脱离害命之刀的。  

144:11 求你救拔我、救我脱离外邦人的手。他们的口说谎话、他们的右手起假誓。  
144:12 我们的儿子、从幼年好像树栽子长大、我们的女儿、如同殿角石、是按建宫的样式凿成的。  
144:13 我们的仓盈满、能出各样的粮食、我们的羊、在田间孳生千万。  
144:14 我们的牛驮着满驮、没有人闯进来抢夺、也没有人出去争战、我们的街市上、也没有哭号的声音。  
144:15 遇见这光景的百姓、便为有福。有耶和华为他们的　神、这百姓便为有福。
