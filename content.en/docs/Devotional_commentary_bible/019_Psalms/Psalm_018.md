18:1 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.  
18:2 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.  
18:3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.  
18:4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.  
18:5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.  

18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.  
18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.  
18:8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  
18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.  
18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.  

18:11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.  
18:12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.  
18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.  
18:14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.  
18:15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.  

18:16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.  
18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.  
18:18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.  
18:19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.  
18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.  

18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.  
18:22 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.  
18:23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.  
18:24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.  
18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;  

18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.  
18:27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.  
18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.  
18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.  
18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.  

18:31 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?  
18:32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.  
18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.  
18:34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.  
18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.  

18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.  
18:37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.  
18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.  
18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.  
18:40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.  

18:41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  
18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.  
18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.  
18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.  
18:45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.  

18:46 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.  
18:47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.  
18:48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.  
18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.  
18:50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

18:1 〔耶和华的仆人大卫的诗、交与伶长。当耶和华救他脱离一切仇敌和扫罗之手的日子、他向耶和华念这诗的话。说、〕耶和华我的力量阿、我爱你。  
18:2 耶和华是我的岩石、我的山寨、我的救主、我的　神、我的磐石、我所投靠的。他是我的盾牌、是拯救我的角、是我的高台。  
18:3 我要求告当赞美的耶和华。这样我必从仇敌手中被救出来。  
18:4 曾有死亡的绳索缠绕我。匪类的急流使我惊惧。  
18:5 阴间的绳索缠绕我。死亡的网罗临到我。  

18:6 我在急难中求告耶和华、向我的　神呼求。他从殿中听了我的声音、我在他面前的呼求入了他的耳中。  
18:7 那时因他发怒、地就摇撼战抖、山的根基也震动摇撼。  
18:8 从他鼻孔冒烟上腾、从他口中发火焚烧。连炭也着了。  
18:9 他又使天下垂、亲自降临。有黑云在他脚下。  
18:10 他坐着基路伯飞行。他借着风的翅膀快飞。  

18:11 他以黑暗为藏身之处、以水的黑暗、天空的厚云、为他四围的行宫。  
18:12 因他面前的光辉、他的厚云行过。便有冰雹火炭。  
18:13 耶和华也在天上打雷。至高者发出声音、便有冰雹火炭。  
18:14 他射出箭来、使仇敌四散。多多发出闪电、使他们扰乱。  
18:15 耶和华阿、你的斥责一发、你鼻孔的气一出、海底就出现、大地的根基也显露。  

18:16 他从高天伸手抓住我。把我从大水中拉上来。  
18:17 他救我脱离我的劲敌、和那些恨我的人。因为他们比我强盛。  
18:18 我遭遇灾难的日子、他们来攻击我。但耶和华是我的倚靠。  
18:19 他又领我到宽阔之处。他救拔我、因他喜悦我。  
18:20 耶和华按着我的公义报答我、按着我手中的清洁赏赐我。  

18:21 因为我遵守了耶和华的道、未曾作恶离开我的　神。  
18:22 他的一切典章常在我面前。他的律例我也未曾丢弃。  
18:23 我在他面前作了完全人。我也保守自己远离我的罪孽。  
18:24 所以耶和华按我的公义、按我在他眼前手中的清洁、偿还我。  
18:25 慈爱的人、你以慈爱待他。完全的人、你以完全待他。  

18:26 清洁的人、你以清洁待他。乖僻的人、你以弯曲待他。  
18:27 困苦的百姓、你必拯救。高傲的眼目、你必使他降卑。  
18:28 你必点着我的灯。耶和华我的　神必照明我的黑暗。  
18:29 我借着你冲入敌军、借着我的　神跳过墙垣。  
18:30 至于　神、他的道是完全的。耶和华的话是炼净的。凡投靠他的、他便作他们的盾牌。  

18:31 除了耶和华、谁是　神呢。除了我们的　神、谁是磐石呢。  
18:32 惟有那以力量束我的腰、使我行为完全的、他是　神。  
18:33 他使我的脚快如母鹿的蹄、又使我在高处安稳。  
18:34 他教导我的手能以争战、甚至我的膀臂能开铜弓。  
18:35 你把你的救恩给我作盾牌。你的右手扶持我。你的温和使我为大。  

18:36 你使我脚下的地步宽阔。我的脚未曾滑跌。  
18:37 我要追赶我的仇敌、并要追上他们。不将他们灭绝、我总不归回。  
18:38 我要打伤他们、使他们不能起来。他们必倒在我的脚下。  
18:39 因为你曾以力量束我的腰、使我能争战。你也使那起来攻击我的都服在我以下。  
18:40 你又使我的仇敌在我面前转背逃跑、叫我能以剪除那恨我的人。  

18:41 他们呼求、却无人拯救、就是呼求耶和华、他也不应允。  
18:42 我捣碎他们、如同风前的灰尘、倒出他们、如同街上的泥土。  
18:43 你救我脱离百姓的争竞、立我作列国的元首。我素不认识的民必事奉我。  
18:44 他们一听见我的名声、就必顺从我。外邦人要投降我。  
18:45 外邦人要衰残、战战兢兢的出他们的营寨。  

18:46 耶和华是活　神。愿我的磐石被人称颂。愿救我的　神被人尊崇。  
18:47 这位　神、就是那为我伸冤、使众民服在我以下的。  
18:48 你救我脱离仇敌。又把我举起、高过那些起来攻击我的。你救我脱离强暴的人。  
18:49 耶和华阿、因此我要在外邦中称谢你、歌颂你的名。  
18:50 耶和华赐极大的救恩给他所立的王、施慈爱给他的受膏者、就是给大卫和他的后裔、直到永远。
