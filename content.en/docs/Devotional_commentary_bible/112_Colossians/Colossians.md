Colossians Chapter 1  <  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,  
1:2 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
1:3 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,  
1:4 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,  
1:5 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;  
1:6 Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:  
1:7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;  
1:8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.  
1:9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;  
1:10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;  
1:11 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;  
1:12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:  
1:13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:  
1:14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:  
1:15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:  
1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:  
1:17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.  
1:18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.  
1:19 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;  
1:20 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.  
1:21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
1:22 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:  
1:23 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;  
1:24 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:  
1:25 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;  
1:26 Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:  
1:27 To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:  
1:28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:  
1:29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.

Colossians Chapter 2  <  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
2:1 For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;  
2:2 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;  
2:3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
2:4 And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.  
2:5 For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.  
2:6 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:  
2:7 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.  
2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.  
2:9 For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.  
2:10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:  
2:11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:  
2:12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.  
2:13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;  
2:14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;  
2:15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.  
2:16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:  
2:17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.  
2:18 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,  
2:19 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.  
2:20 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,  
2:21 (Touch not; taste not; handle not;  
2:22 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?  
2:23 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.

Colossians Chapter 3  <  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
3:1 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.  
3:2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.  
3:3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.  
3:4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.  
3:5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:  
3:6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:  
3:7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.  
3:8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.  
3:9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;  
3:10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:  
3:11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.  
3:12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;  
3:13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.  
3:14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.  
3:15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.  
3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.  
3:17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.  
3:18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.  
3:19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.  
3:20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.  
3:21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.  
3:22 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:  
3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;  
3:24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.  
3:25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

Colossians Chapter 4  <  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
4:1 Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.  
4:2 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;  
4:3 Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:  
4:4 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.  
4:5 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.  
4:6 Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.  
4:7 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:  
4:8 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;  
4:9 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.  
4:10 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)  
4:11 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.  
4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.  
4:13 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.  
4:14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.  
4:15 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.  
4:16 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.  
4:17 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.  
4:18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.

歌罗西书 1章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29

1:1 奉　神旨意、作基督耶稣使徒的保罗、和兄弟提摩太、  
1:2 写信给歌罗西的圣徒、在基督里有忠心的弟兄。愿恩惠平安、从　神我们的父、归与你们。  
1:3 我们感谢　神我们主耶稣基督的父、常常为你们祷告。  
1:4 因听见你们在基督耶稣里的信心、并向众圣徒的爱心。  
1:5 是为那给你们存在天上的盼望。这盼望就是你们从前在福音真理的道上所听见的。  

1:6 这福音传到你们那里、也传到普天之下、并且结果增长、如同在你们中间、自从你们听见福音、真知道　神恩惠的日子一样。  
1:7 正如你们从我们所亲爱、一同作仆人的以巴弗所学的。他为我们〔有古卷作你们〕作了基督忠心的执事。  
1:8 也把你们因圣灵所存的爱心告诉了我们。  
1:9 因此、我们自从听见的日子、也就为你们不住的祷告祈求、愿你们在一切属灵的智慧悟性上、满心知道　神的旨意。  
1:10 好叫你们行事为人对得起主、凡事蒙他喜悦、在一切善事上结果子、渐渐的多知道　神。  

1:11 照他荣耀的权能、得以在各样的力上加力、好叫你们凡事欢欢喜喜的忍耐宽容。  
1:12 又感谢父、叫我们能与众圣徒在光明中同得基业。  
1:13 他救了我们脱离黑暗的权势、把我们迁到他爱子的国里。  
1:14 我们在爱子里得蒙救赎、罪过得以赦免。  
1:15 爱子是那不能看见之　神的像、是首生的、在一切被造的以先。  

1:16 因为万有都是靠他造的、无论是天上的、地上的、能看见的、不能看见的、或是有位的、主治的、执政的、掌权的、一概都是借着他造的、又是为他造的。  
1:17 他在万有之先。万有也靠他而立。  
1:18 他也是教会全体之首。他是元始、是从死里首先复生的、使他可以在凡事上居首位。  
1:19 因为父喜欢叫一切的丰盛、在他里面居住。  
1:20 既然借着他在十字架上所流的血、成就了和平、便借着他叫万有、无论是地上的、天上的、都与自己和好了。  

1:21 你们从前与　神隔绝、因着恶行、心里与他为敌。  
1:22 但如今他借着基督的肉身受死、叫你们与自己和好、都成了圣洁、没有瑕疵、无可责备、把你们引到自己面前。  
1:23 只要你们在所信的道上恒心、根基稳固、坚定不移、不至被引动失去〔原文作离开〕福音的盼望。这福音就是你们所听过的、也是传与普天下万人听的。〔万人原文作凡受造的〕我保罗也作了这福音的执事。  
1:24 现在我为你们受苦、倒觉欢乐、并且为基督的身体、就是为教会、要在我肉身上补满基督患难的缺欠。  
1:25 我照　神为你们所赐我的职分、作了教会的执事、要把　神的道理传得全备。  

1:26 这道理就是历世历代所隐藏的奥秘、但如今向他的圣徒显明了。  
1:27 　神愿意叫他们知道、这奥秘在外邦人中有何等丰盛的荣耀。就是基督在你们心里成了有荣耀的盼望。  
1:28 我们传扬他、是用诸般的智慧、劝戒各人、教导各人。要把各人在基督里完完全全的引到　神面前。  
1:29 我也为此劳苦、照着他在我里面运用的大能、尽心竭力。

歌罗西书 2章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23

2:1 我愿意你们晓得我为你们和老底嘉人、并一切没有与我亲自见面的人、是何等的尽心竭力。  
2:2 要叫他们的心得安慰、因爱心互相联络、以致丰丰足足在悟性中有充足的信心、使他们真知　神的奥秘、就是基督。  
2:3 所积蓄的一切智慧知识、都在他里面藏着。  
2:4 我说这话、免得有人用花言巧语迷惑你们。  
2:5 我身子虽与你们相离、心却与你们同在、见你们循规蹈矩、信基督的心也坚固、我就欢喜了。  

2:6 你们既然接受了主基督耶稣、就当遵他而行。  
2:7 在他里面生根建造、信心坚固、正如你们所领的教训、感谢的心也更增长了。  
2:8 你们要谨慎、恐怕有人用他的理学、和虚空的妄言、不照着基督、乃照人间的遗传、和世上的小学、就把你们掳去。  
2:9 因为　神本性一切的丰盛、都有形有体的居住在基督里面。  
2:10 你们在他里面也得了丰盛。他是各样执政掌权者的元首。  

2:11 你们在他里面、也受了不是人手所行的割礼、乃是基督使你们脱去肉体情欲的割礼。  
2:12 你们既受洗与他一同埋葬、也就在此与他一同复活。都因信那叫他从死里复活　神的功用。  
2:13 你们从前在过犯、和未受割礼的肉体中死了、　神赦免了你们〔或作我们〕一切过犯、便叫你们与基督一同活过来。  
2:14 又涂抹了在律例上所写、攻击我们有碍于我们的字据、把他撤去、钉在十字架上。  
2:15 既将一切执政的掌权的掳来、明显给众人看、就仗着十字架夸胜。  

2:16 所以不拘在饮食上、或节期、月朔、安息日、都不可让人论断你们。  
2:17 这些原是后事的影儿。那形体却是基督。  
2:18 不可让人因着故意谦虚、和敬拜天使、就夺去你们的奖赏。这等人拘泥在所见过的、〔有古卷作这等人窥察所没有见过的〕随着自己的欲心、无故的自高自大、  
2:19 不持定元首、全身既然靠着他筋节得以相助联络、就因　神大得长进。  
2:20 你们若是与基督同死、脱离了世上的小学、为甚么仍像在世俗中活着、服从那不可拿、不可尝、不可摸、等类的规条呢。  

2:21 见上节
2:22 这都是照人所吩咐所教导的。说到这一切、正用的时候就都败坏了。  
2:23 这些规条、使人徒有智慧之名、用私意崇拜、自表谦卑、苦待己身、其实在克制肉体的情欲上、是毫无功效。

歌罗西书 3章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

3:1 所以你们若真与基督一同复活、就当求在上面的事。那里有基督坐在　神的右边。  
3:2 你们要思念上面的事、不要思念地上的事。  
3:3 因为你们已经死了、你们的生命与基督一同藏在　神里面。  
3:4 基督是我们的生命、他显现的时候、你们也要与他一同显现在荣耀里。  
3:5 所以要治死你们在地上的肢体。就如淫乱、污秽、邪情、恶欲、和贪婪、贪婪就与拜偶像一样。  

3:6 因这些事、　神的忿怒必临到那悖逆之子。  
3:7 当你们在这些事中活着的时候、也曾这样行过。  
3:8 但现在你们要弃绝这一切的事、以及恼恨、忿怒、恶毒、〔或作阴毒〕毁谤、并口中污秽的言语。  
3:9 不要彼此说谎。因你们已经脱去旧人、和旧人的行为、  
3:10 穿上了新人。这新人在知识上渐渐更新、正如造他主的形像。  

3:11 在此并不分希利尼人、犹太人、受割礼的、未受割礼的、化外人、西古提人、为奴的、自主的。惟有基督是包括一切、又住在各人之内。  
3:12 所以你们既是　神的选民、圣洁蒙爱的人、就要存〔原文作穿下同〕怜悯、恩慈、谦虚、温柔、忍耐的心。  
3:13 倘若这人与那人有嫌隙、总要彼此包容、彼此饶恕。主怎样饶恕了你们、你们也要怎样饶恕人。  
3:14 在这一切之外、要存着爱心。爱心就是联络全德的。  
3:15 又要叫基督的平安在你们心里作主。你们也为此蒙召、归为一体。且要存感谢的心。  

3:16 当用各样的智慧、把基督的道理、丰丰富富的存在心里、〔或作当把基督的道理丰丰富富的存在心里以各样的智慧〕用诗章、颂词、灵歌、彼此教导、互相劝戒心被恩感歌颂　神。  
3:17 无论作甚么、或说话、或行事、都要奉主耶稣的名、借着他感谢父　神。  
3:18 你们作妻子的、当顺服自己的丈夫、这在主里面是相宜的。  
3:19 你们作丈夫的、要爱你们的妻子、不可苦待他们。  
3:20 你们作儿女的、要凡事听从父母、因为这是主所喜悦的。  

3:21 你们作父亲的、不要惹儿女的气、恐怕他们失了志气。  
3:22 你们作仆人的、要凡事听从你们肉身的主人、不要只在眼前事奉、像是讨人喜欢的、总要存心诚实敬畏主。  
3:23 无论作甚么、都要从心里作、像是给主作的、不是给人作的。  
3:24 因你们知道从主那里、必得着基业为赏赐。你们所事奉的乃是主基督。  
3:25 那行不义的、必受不义的报应。主并不偏待人。  


* ----------------------------------------

歌罗西书 4章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18

4:1 你们作主人的、要公公平平的待仆人、因为知道你们也有一位主在天上。  
4:2 你们要恒切祷告、在此儆醒感恩。  
4:3 也要为我们祷告、求　神给我们开传道的门、能以讲基督的奥秘、（我为此被捆锁)  
4:4 叫我按着所该说的话、将这奥秘发明出来。  
4:5 你们要爱惜光阴、用智慧与外人交往。  

4:6 你们的言语要常常带着和气、好像用盐调和、就可知道该怎样回答各人。  
4:7 有我亲爱的兄弟推基古要将我一切的事都告诉你们。他是忠心的执事、和我一同作主的仆人。  
4:8 我特意打发他到你们那里去、好叫你们知道我们的光景、又叫他安慰你们的心。  
4:9 我又打发一位亲爱忠心的兄弟阿尼西母同去。他也是你们那里的人。他们要把这里一切的事都告诉你们。  
4:10 与我一同坐监的亚里达古问你们安。巴拿巴的表弟马可也问你们安。（说到这马可、你们已经受了吩咐。他若到了你们那里、你们就接待他。)  

4:11 耶数又称为犹士都、也问你们安。奉割礼的人中、只有这三个人、是为　神的国与我一同作工的、也是叫我心里得安慰的。  
4:12 有你们那里的人、作基督耶稣仆人的以巴弗问你们安。他在祷告之间、常为你们竭力的祈求、愿你们在　神一切的旨意上、得以完全、信心充足、能站立得稳。  
4:13 他为你们和老底嘉并希拉波立的弟兄、多多的劳苦。这是我可以给他作见证的。  
4:14 所亲爱的医生路加、和底马问你们安。  
4:15 请问老底嘉的弟兄和宁法、并他家里的教会安。  

4:16 你们念了这书信、便交给老底嘉的教会、叫他们也念。你们也要念从老底嘉来的书信。  
4:17 要对亚基布说、务要谨慎、尽你从主所受的职分。  
4:18 我保罗亲笔问你们安。你们要记念我的捆锁。愿恩惠常与你们同在。
