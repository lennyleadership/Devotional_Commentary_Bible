13:1 Let brotherly love continue.  
13:2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.  
13:3 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.  
13:4 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.  
13:5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.  

13:6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.  
13:7 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.  
13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.  
13:9 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.  
13:10 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.  

13:11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.  
13:12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.  
13:13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.  
13:14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.  
13:15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.  

13:16 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.  
13:17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.  
13:18 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.  
13:19 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.  
13:20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,  

13:21 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.  
13:22 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.  
13:23 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.  
13:24 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.  
13:25 Grace be with you all. Amen.

13:1 你们务要常存弟兄相爱的心。  
13:2 不可忘记用爱心接待客旅。因为曾有接待客旅的、不知不觉就接待了天使。  
13:3 你们要记念被捆绑的人、好像与他们同受捆绑、也要记念遭苦害的人、想到自己也在肉身之内。  
13:4 婚姻、人人都当尊重、床也不可污秽。因为苟合行淫的人　神必要审判。  
13:5 你们存心不可贪爱钱财。要以自己所有的为足。因为主曾说、『我总不撇下你、也不丢弃你。』  
 
13:6 所以我们可以放胆说、『主是帮助我的、我必不惧怕。人能把我怎么样呢。』  
13:7 从前引导你们、传　神之道给你们的人、你们要想念他们、效法他们的信心、留心看他们为人的结局。  
13:8 耶稣基督、昨日今日一直到永远是一样的。  
13:9 你们不要被那诸般怪异的教训勾引了去。因为人心靠恩得坚固才是好的。并不是靠饮食。那在饮食上专心的、从来没有得着益处。  
13:10 我们有一祭坛、上面的祭物是那些在帐幕中供职的人不可同吃的。  
 
13:11 原来牲畜的血、被大祭司带入圣所作赎罪祭、牲畜的身子、被烧在营外。  
13:12 所以耶稣、要用自己的血叫百姓成圣、也就在城门外受苦。  
13:13 这样、我们也当出到营外就了他去、忍受他所受的凌辱。  
13:14 我们在这里本没有常存的城、乃是寻求那将来的城。  
13:15 我们应当靠着耶稣、常常以颂赞为祭、献给　神、这就是那承认主名之人嘴唇的果子。  
 
13:16 只是不可忘记行善、和捐输的事。因为这样的祭、是　神所喜悦的。  
13:17 你们要依从那些引导你们的、且要顺服。因他们为你们的灵魂时刻儆醒、好像那将来交帐的人。你们要使他们交的时候有快乐、不至忧愁。若忧愁就与你们无益了。  
13:18 请你们为我们祷告。因我们自觉良心无亏、愿意凡事按正道而行。  
13:19 我更求你们为我祷告、使我快些回到你们那里去。  
13:20 但愿赐平安的　神、就是那凭永约之血使群羊的大牧人我主耶稣、从死里复活的　神、  
 
13:21 在各样善事上、成全你们、叫你们遵行他的旨意、又借着耶稣基督在你们心里行他所喜悦的事。愿荣耀归给他、直到永永远远。阿们。  
13:22 弟兄们、我略略写信给你们、望你们听我劝勉的话。  
13:23 你们该知道我们的兄弟提摩太已经释放了。他若快来、我必同他去见你们。  
13:24 请你们问引导你们的诸位和众圣徒安。从义大利来的人也问你们安。  
13:25 愿恩惠常与你们众人同在。阿们。
