11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  
11:2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.  
11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  
11:4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.  
11:5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.  

11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.  
11:7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.  
11:8 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.  
11:9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:  
11:10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  

11:11 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.  
11:12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.  
11:13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.  
11:14 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.  
11:15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.  

11:16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.  
11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,  
11:18 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:  
11:19 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.  
11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.  

11:21 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.  
11:22 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.  
11:23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.  
11:24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;  
11:25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;  

11:26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.  
11:27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.  
11:28 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.  
11:29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.  
11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.  

11:31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.  
11:32 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:  
11:33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,  
11:34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.  
11:35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:  

11:36 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:  
11:37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;  
11:38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.  
11:39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:  
11:40 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

11:1 信就是所望之事的实底、是未见之事的确据。  
11:2 古人在这信上得了美好的证据。  
11:3 我们因着信、就知道诸世界是借　神话造成的。这样、所看见的、并不是从显然之物造出来的。  
11:4 亚伯因着信献祭与　神、比该隐所献的更美、因此便得了称义的见证、就是　神指他礼物作的见证。他虽然死了、却因这信仍旧说话。  
11:5 以诺因着信被接去、不至于见死。人也找不着他、因为　神已经把他接去了。只是他被接去以先、已经得了　神喜悦他的明证。  
 
11:6 人非有信、就不能得　神的喜悦。因为到　神面前来的人、必须信有神，且信他赏赐那寻求他的人。  
11:7 挪亚因着信、既蒙　神指示他未见的事、动了敬畏的心、预备了一只方舟、使他全家得救。因此就定了那世代的罪、自己也承受了那从信而来的义。  
11:8 亚伯拉罕因着信、蒙召的时候、就遵命出去、往将来要得为业的地方去。出去的时候、还不知往那里去。  
11:9 他因着信、就在所应许之地作客、好像在异地居住帐棚、与那同蒙一个应许的以撒、雅各一样。  
11:10 因为他等候那座有根基的城、就是　神所经营所建造的。  
 
11:11 因着信、连撒拉自己、虽然过了生育的岁数、还能怀孕。因他以为那应许他的是可信的。  
11:12 所以从一个彷彿已死的人就生出子孙、如同天上的星那样众多、海边的沙那样无数。  
11:13 这些人都是存着信心死的、并没有得着所应许的、却从远处望见、且欢喜迎接、又承认自己在世上是客旅、是寄居的。  
11:14 说这样话的人、是表明自己要找一个家乡。  
11:15 他们若想念所离开的家乡、还有可以回去的机会。  
 
11:16 他们却羡慕一个更美的家乡、就是在天上的。所以　神被称为他们的　神、并不以为耻。因为他已经给他们预备了一座城。  
11:17 亚伯拉罕因着信、被试验的时候、就把以撒献上。这便是那欢喜领受应许的、将自己独生的儿子献上。  
11:18 论到这儿子曾有话说、『从以撒生的才要称为你的后裔。』  
11:19 他以为　神还能叫人从死里复活。他也彷彿从死中得回他的儿子来。  
11:20 以撒因着信、就指着将来的事、给雅各以扫祝福。  
 
11:21 雅各因着信、临死的时候、给约瑟的两个儿子各自祝福、扶着杖头敬拜　神。  
11:22 约瑟因着信、临终的时候、提到以色列族将来要出埃及、并为自己的骸骨留下遗命。  
11:23 摩西生下来、他的父母见他是个俊美的孩子、就因着信把他藏了三个月、并不怕王命。  
11:24 摩西因着信、长大了就不肯称为法老女儿之子。  
11:25 他宁可和　神的百姓同受苦害、也不愿暂时享受罪中之乐。  
 
11:26 他看为基督受的凌辱、比埃及的财物更宝贵。因他想望所要得的赏赐。  
11:27 他因着信、就离开埃及、不怕王怒。因为他恒心忍耐、如同看见那不能看见的主。  
11:28 他因着信、就守逾越节、〔守或作立〕行洒血的礼、免得那灭长子的临近以色列人。  
11:29 他们因着信、过红海如行干地。埃及人试着要过去、就被吞灭了。  
11:30 以色列人因着信、围绕耶利哥城七日、城墙就倒塌了。  
 
11:31 妓女喇合因着信、曾和和平平的接待探子、就不与那些不顺从的人一同灭亡。  
11:32 我又何必再说呢。若要一一细说、基甸、巴拉、参孙、耶弗他、大卫、撒母耳、和众先知的事、时候就不够了。  
11:33 他们因着信、制伏了敌国、行了公义、得了应许、堵了狮子的口。  
11:34 灭了烈火的猛势、脱了刀剑的锋刃、软弱变为刚强、争战显出勇敢、打退外邦的全军。  
11:35 有妇人得自己的死人复活、又有人忍受严刑、不肯苟且得释放、〔释放原文作赎〕为要得着更美的复活。  
 
11:36 又有人忍受戏弄、鞭打、捆锁、监禁、各等的磨炼、  
11:37 被石头打死、被锯锯死、受试探、被刀杀。披着绵羊山羊的皮各处奔跑、受穷乏、患难、苦害、  
11:38 在旷野、山岭、山洞、地穴、飘流无定。本是世界不配有的人。  
11:39 这些人都是因信得了美好的证据、却仍未得着所应许的。  
11:40 因为　神给我们预备了更美的事、叫他们若不与我们同得、就不能完全。
