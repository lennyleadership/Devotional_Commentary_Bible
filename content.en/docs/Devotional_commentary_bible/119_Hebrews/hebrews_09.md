9:1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.  
9:2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.  
9:3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;  
9:4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;  
9:5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.  

9:6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.  
9:7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:  
9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:  
9:9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;  
9:10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.  

9:11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;  
9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.  
9:13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:  
9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?  
9:15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.  

9:16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.  
9:17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.  
9:18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.  
9:19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,  
9:20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.  

9:21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.  
9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  
9:23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  
9:24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:  
9:25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;  

9:26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.  
9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:  
9:28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

9:1 原来前约有礼拜的条例、和属世界的圣幕。  
9:2 因为有预备的帐幕、头一层叫作圣所。里面有灯台、桌子、和陈设饼。  
9:3 第二幔子后、又有一层帐幕、叫作至圣所。  
9:4 有金香炉、〔炉或作坛〕有包金的约柜、柜里有盛吗哪的金罐、和亚伦发过芽的杖、并两块约版。  
9:5 柜上面有荣耀基路伯的影罩着施恩座。〔施恩原文作蔽罪〕这几件我现在不能一一细说。  
 
9:6 这些物件既如此预备齐了、众祭司就常进头一层帐幕、行拜　神的礼。  
9:7 至于第二层帐幕、惟有大祭司一年一次独自进去、没有不带着血、为自己和百姓的过错献上。  
9:8 圣灵用此指明、头一层帐幕仍存的时候、进入至圣所的路还未显明。  
9:9 那头一层帐幕作现今的一个表样、所献的礼物和祭物、就着良心说、都不能叫礼拜的人得以完全。  
9:10 这些事连那饮食和诸般洗濯的规矩、都不过是属肉体的条例、命定到振兴的时候为止。  
 
9:11 但现在基督已经来到、作了将来美事的大祭司、经过那更大更全备的帐幕、不是人手所造也不是属乎这世界的。  
9:12 并且不用山羊和牛犊的血、乃用自己的血、只一次进入圣所、成了永远赎罪的事。  
9:13 若山羊和公牛的血、并母牛犊的灰、洒在不洁的人身上、尚且叫人成圣、身体洁净。  
9:14 何况基督借着永远的灵、将自己无瑕无疵献给　神、他的血岂不更能洗净你们的心〔原文作良心〕除去你们的死行、使你们事奉那永生　神么。  
9:15 为此他作了新约的中保。既然受死赎了人在前约之时所犯的罪过、便叫蒙召之人得着所应许永远的产业。  
 
9:16 凡有遗命、必须等到留遗命的人死了。〔遗命原文与约字同〕
9:17 因为人死了、遗命才有效力、若留遗命的尚在、那遗命还有用处么。  
9:18 所以前约也不是不用血立的。  
9:19 因为摩西当日照着律法、将各样诫命传给众百姓、就拿朱红色绒和牛膝草、把牛犊山羊的血和水、洒在书上、又洒在众百姓身上、说、  
9:20 『这血就是　神与你们立约的凭据。』  
 
9:21 他又照样把血洒在帐幕、和各样器皿上。  
9:22 按着律法、凡物差不多都是用血洁净的、若不流血、罪就不得赦免了。  
9:23 照着天上样式作的物件、必须用这些祭物去洁净。但那天上的本物、自然当用更美的祭物去洁净。  
9:24 因为基督并不是进了人手所造的圣所、（这不过是真圣所的影像)乃是进了天堂、如今为我们显在　神面前。  
9:25 也不是多次将自己献上、像那大祭司每年带着牛羊的血进入圣所。〔牛羊的血原文作不是自己的血〕
 
9:26 如果这样、他从创世以来、就必多次受苦了。但如今在这末世显现一次、把自己献为祭、好除掉罪。  
9:27 按着定命、人人都有一死、死后且有审判。  
9:28 像这样、基督既然一次被献、担当了多人的罪、将来要向那等候他的人第二次显现、并与罪无关、乃是为拯救他们。
