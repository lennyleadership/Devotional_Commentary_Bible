5:1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:  
5:2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.  
5:3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.  
5:4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.  
5:5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.  

5:6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  
5:7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;  
5:8 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;  
5:9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;  
5:10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.  

5:11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.  
5:12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.  
5:13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.  
5:14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

5:1 凡从人间挑选的大祭司、是奉派替人办理属　神的事、为要献上礼物、和赎罪祭。〔或作要为罪献上礼物和祭物〕
5:2 他能体谅那愚蒙的、和失迷的人、因为他自己也是被软弱所困。  
5:3 故此他理当为百姓和自己献祭赎罪。  
5:4 这大祭司的尊荣、没有人自取、惟要蒙　神所召、像亚伦一样。  
5:5 如此、基督也不是自取荣耀作大祭司、乃是在乎向他说『你是我的儿子、我今日生你。』的那一位。  
 
5:6 就如经上又有一处说、『你是照着麦基洗德的等次永远为祭司。』  
5:7 基督在肉体的时候、既大声哀哭、流泪祷告恳求那能救他免死的主、就因他的虔诚、蒙了应允。  
5:8 他虽然为儿子、还是因所受的苦难学了顺从。  
5:9 他既得以完全、就为凡顺从他的人、成了永远得救的根源。  
5:10 并蒙　神照着麦基洗德的等次称他为大祭司。  
 
5:11 论到麦基洗德、我们有好些话、并且难以解明、因为你们听不进去。  
5:12 看你们学习的工夫、本该作师傅、谁知还得有人将　神圣言小学的开端、另教导你们。并且成了那必须吃奶、不能吃干粮的人。  
5:13 凡只能吃奶的、都不熟练仁义的道理。因为他是婴孩。  
5:14 惟独长大成人的、才能吃干粮、他们的心窍、习练得通达、就能分辨好歹了。

      <h2>Hebrews 5:1-5 ... Aaron and Jesus, both High Priests ... but Jesus is far superior!</h2>
      <p>
00:01 Ah. Join me for class today. Our text is found in Hebrews, chapter five. Hebrews, chapter five, in fact. And I debated on how many verses to try to cover but prayerfully. I've decided we're going to cover the first five verses of Hebrews five. 
00:29 Hebrews five. Chapter five begins an expanse of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 six chapters, chapters five through chapter number ten, <b>giving some detail about the high priestly ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>. I think this may be the reason what we're about to begin studying, why the book of Hebrews is often neglected. 
01:06 All that Old Testament history, all that about the great high priesthood, I don't understand it. Paul even accuses these Hebrews of not having matured enough to be able to comprehend our Lord's present day ministry on our bay(?). 
01:30 Told them they were dull of hearing. Let me read our text. And granted, it does get complex, does get involved. For every high priest taken among men now, these are human beings. Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men. 
02:00 In the things pertaining to God that he may what's the job of the high priest? Jewish. He's not talking about gentile priest of any kind. <b>Jewish high priest</b>. That he may offer that <b>he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin</b>. 
02:25 S the altar is his major place of business, his major center of activity. The altar that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. Verse two. Who can have compassion on the ignorant? Aaron, his son Eliezer, all the high priests of Israel, they could have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way. 
03:06 I'll explain that or try to. For that he himself, the earthly high priest, he himself also is compassed with infirmity verse three and by reason hereof he ought as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins. 
03:34 That verse just said aaron had to offer sacrifices for his own sins before he could offer sacrifices for the sins of Israel, of the nation. Verse four. Now no man aaron didn't no man taketh this honor unto himself. 
03:58 You do not volunteer. For the high priesthood. But he that is called of God, as was Aaron. We have four verses on the it's an adjective. Let's get used to it. Aaronic priesthood. The priesthood first filled the high priesthood first filled by Aaron. 
04:25 Now verse five. So also christ. So also christ. Paul didn't call him Jesus. Here Christ. Christos god's anointed so also Christ glorified not himself never glorified not himself to be made a high priest. 
04:56 Jesus did not take on his ministry of high priesthood on his own. It was not a personal initiative. Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest. But he that said unto him under who it is going to be talking to the son. 
05:18 Thou art my son, today have I begotten thee. Today have I begotten thee. We look for four verses at Aaron and then one verse we notice Jesus, our great high priest. Let's wade into let's do the vocabulary first, if we could. 
05:52 For every high priest. Remember, high priest. Like Michael is the archangel. The word here the Ark priest, the top priest, the eminent priest, the priest who will go for the people of Israel into the holy of Holies. 
06:16 On the Day of Atonement, every high priest taken from among men, lombano reached out and grabbed by the hand taken from among men. God chose Aaron to be high priest. When Aaron died, his son Eliezer became high priest. 
06:43 Taken from among men. And probably more than just the Verb taken, god chose them. God called them. God ordained them is the idea from among men. Aaron had to be a member of the Jewish nation. Not only that, Aaron had to be of the tribe of Levi. 
07:10 No other tribe, God's idea, God's command, God's word. No other tribe could serve as a high priest. All the priests were Levites, descendants of Aaron. Taken from among men. And I just want to add something very quickly. 
07:32 Just like Aaron, the high priest of Israel had to be a human being taken from among men. So did the Lord Jesus Christ, my great high priest, have to come from among men. That's why God sent him to be virgin born. 
07:50 That's why God sent him so he could be touched with the feeling. Of my infirmities. That's why God sent him so Jesus in a human body could do what Adam failed to do in a human body defeat the devil so that Jesus in a human body could do what none of the rest of us could have ever done live sinlessly. 
08:16 Jesus in a human body accomplished everything mankind had failed to do. And as such, taken from among men god had to become flesh so that Jesus could be my great high priest. Back to verse one every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men. 
08:45 Ordained for men that does carry the idea of ordination sanctification set apart put in office. Let me glance at the katahistomy histamine means to sit god picked chose Aaron out of the children of men out of the children of Israel out of the tribe of and then set him down in the high priest ordained him in the high priesthood. 
09:16 Now why did God do that? And remember what a priest does a priest through the blood sacrifices tends to say this is what God expects of us. He brings God to earth. In that sense, God demands blood atonement. 
09:33 And then when I bring the blood and the blood is shed and I say, apply that blood to my life, Lord, I lay my hand on the head of that innocent lamb identifying that's me getting to go to I get ushered into God's presence, work at the altar. 
09:51 Major job of the high priest. And Jesus'greatest job. Jesus'greatest job, as our great high priest occurred at the altar. Not the altar in the Jewish temple. They hated him there. The altar called the Old Rugged Cross of Calvary, where Jesus not only offered himself as our great high priest, but he died himself. 
10:19 He is is both the offerer the high priest and the sacrifice, the Lamb of God. Hallelujah. What a savior he's ordained of God, set apart of God that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sin. That's two different words. 
10:41 Gifts and sacrifices for sin. The word there for gifts. Sometimes gifts and sacrifices are used interchangeably, but I strongly think not here. The word sacrifice is thusea, and it means blood sacrifice, torture. 
11:06 Throat slit, blood splattering everywhere. It's a little heartbeat flushes out that last bit of blood and agony. Gifts and sacrifices. The gifts. Probably not a hint of blood in that word. Gifts. The gifts, probably I can't go back. 
11:27 We don't have time today. Leviticus one through seven. That is probably the meal offering. Picture of Jesus us worshipping his father, living for his father, sacrificing himself to his father. But not a drop of blood in that offering. 
11:45 It has to be matched with a whole burn offering. That does have blood. Has to be matched with a sin offering. It does have blood. This is what it means. I need an amen. Jesus lived right and then he died right? 
11:59 Let me reverse it. If he hadn't lived right, he couldn't have died right? He lived sinlessly so he could die vicariously. And that priest will offer the meat offering. But it is a meal offering made of fine flour can't get into that. 
12:17 And thusea sacrifices for sins. If I take that and apply it to my Savior dying on the cross of Calvary, jesus can lift his eyes to his Father gifts. Gifts. The miller father in my flesh. I never sinned. 
12:37 In my flesh. I perfectly obeyed you. In my flesh I give it to you spotless. And it's got frankincense. Smells good to God. God is pleased. And then sacrifices for sin. That's Jesus on the cross. Not only have I lived for you, not only did he give you my body, now give you my blood. 
12:58 I give you my life. I give you my all for sins class. For your sins and for my sins. Still talking about Aaron. Brother Bagel can't hardly quit talking about Jesus. Verse two. Who can have compassion on the ignorant? 
13:23 Aaron and the son of Aaron. When Aaron died the next high priest, they were to have compassion on the ignorant. It that word. Compassion is interesting. It uses metron. M-E-T-I-R-O-N. It's Greek word that means a measure of a little bit of even as much as is humanly possible to have compassion. 
13:53 And then the word pathos. As much feeling as he can muster, Aaron, as he served as the great high priest was to have feeling for the poor old sinners that came to him, feeling for those who had disobeyed God. 
14:09 Unwillingly, unknowingly, actually. But my great high priest oh, I've got to show you this. I've got to show you, High Priest we learned it several lessons ago. Who is touched with the feeling of my infirmity? 
14:24 That's sympathetic. Oh, Jesus can identify with me. Holy completely. Sympathy, empathy, totally. He walked in the flesh in which I walk. He fought the devil, I fight he overcame with the word of God, the same word of God I have in my hand. 
14:48 Aaron it's limited sympathy. Jesus hallelujah. That in all things he might have the preeminence it's unlimited sympathy that he can have compassion on the ignorant. On the ignorant. It's OG no EO. It's the word agnostic. 
15:16 It means those that don't have this is what it means. I sinned, but I didn't mean to. I sinned, but I didn't realize it. I sinned, but I failed to memorize that command like I should. Sins of ignorance. 
15:32 The Old Testament says in the Old Testament, in the old economy, the only forgiveness available at the altar, sins of ignorance, sins that are not willfully committed. We'll probably get to go into that later, but. 
15:52 That's why our verse says he had compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way. On them that are out of the way. That verb is planeto on those who have drifted out of orbit, on those who have grown cold and indifferent and gotten too far away from fellowship with the Savior, with the Lord God Almighty. 
16:23 We are being told Aaron and the High Priest of Israel was effective to some degree, but it was limited because the priests themselves were sinners, were sinners who needed to offer sacrifice for their own sin. 
16:44 But all when you come to Jesus unlimited priesthood, he did not have to die for his own sins. He is compassionate to the nth degree that I get that verse. He also is compassed with infirmity. He is also compassed with infirmity. 
17:10 That's the word that means lack of strength, lack of strength. Compass means he will have compassion on those who maybe physically, but definitely spiritually, lack stamina, lack strength, lack faithfulness to the glory of God. 
17:37 He himself is compassed with imperfect. Aaron himself to be compassed is the verb to lay down with. He lays down every night with human weakness. Himself. He lays down every night with a body that has. 
17:51 Propensity to sin. Verse three. And by reason hereof, he ought as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins. Oh, that is going to be repeated again and again, Aaron. Even on the Day of Atonement, one of the first things Aaron had to do was go through a ritual cleansing himself before he could cleanse the people of Israel. 
18:27 And that's what verse three means. Thank God for the Old Testament priesthood. But it is limited. It is beset by weakness. It can have a measure of compassion, but it can never do what Jesus Christ, the Son of God, can do. 
18:49 Oh, verse four. And no man taketh this honor unto himself. That's lombano again. No man taketh this honor unto himself. You do not elect to become a high priest. God will choose you. God will ordain you. 
19:14 And I'm going to show you in just a minute the apex of tonight's lesson. God chose Jesus. God ordained Jesus to be our great high priest. Just like Jesus got done on the cross what Adam couldn't. Adam lost it all. 
19:33 Jesus gained it all back and then some on Calvary. So Jesus, my great high priest, has outperformed Aaron and all that the Old Testament priesthood could have ever accomplished. No man taketh this honor. 
19:49 Well, that's proof that the priesthood is an honor. It is the word. I'll spell it T-I-M-E time a of great value, of great worth, of great esteem. No man take it this honor unto himself. But he that is called of God, he that is called of God, call Leto, he that is called of God, as was Aaron. 
20:24 God called Caleto. Aaron, you're the one. Moses says he can't speak, says he can't tell. You're the one. You'll be his spokesman. You're going to be the priest. You're going to be the high priest. God called him to that position. 
20:41 And thank God for the Aaron Priesthood. The Aaronic Priesthood. Because that's how Israel got her sins covered every day of Atonement. Covered for another year and another year and another year. My great high priest. 
20:58 Thank God he didn't have to die every day of Atonement. He didn't have to kill a lamb every day of Atonement. He didn't have to kill a lamb every morning, the morning sacrifice. He didn't have to kill a lamb every evening. 
21:10 The evening sacrifice. He is once for all the lamb, once for all the sacrifice. Hallelujah to his name. Verse five. So, also Christ so also Christ I mentioned it when I read the text. Christos. So also Christ means the Anointed One. 
21:35 Literally, it means the one on whom God poured all. That would be the all of the Holy Ghost. That would be the holy. Anointing oil. Aaron's got a whole chapter describing it with him. Psalm 133. All poured out on his head, went down on his beard, went down on his robe, all the way to the bottom, all the way to the skirts of it. 
21:57 Oh, my. What? All like the dew on Herman. It was just a beautiful it's only got three verses. Psalm 133. It, but now Jesus Christ. I'll need an amen here. John tells me Jesus was anointed as. Nobody else was ever anointed. 
22:20 In the Old Testament, three offices are anointed prophets, priests, and kings. You do not see these offices overlapping. King Uzziah tried to become a priest once and God gave him leprosy. It won't work. 
22:37 God will not allow it to. No, no, but when you come to Jesus, I'm going to need an amen. He is both prophet and priest and king. I need to say that better. He is God's prophet, god's priest and God's king. 
22:57 See if you'll agree with me. Jesus is prophet. He's the greatest preacher that ever lived. He's the greatest prophet that ever put shoe leather on the face of planet Earth. God ordained king, king of kings, lord of lords. 
23:12 Anybody believe Jesus is coming back to rule and reign on this earth someday? The anointed king of God. He is prophet. He is king. But, oh, is he priest? He is anointed. He is anointed. As our great high priest John said, he was anointed without measure, beyond measure of the Holy Ghost of God. 
23:36 So also Christ glorified not himself. Doxadzo glorified jesus. Let me just stop and preach this a minute. Jesus never uplifted himself. Never. Never. He always uplifts his father. One day they were bragging on his no, no, these are not my words. 
24:07 My father gave me the words. One day somebody wanted to brag on his miracles, and he rolled. No, these are not my power. It's my father's power. Oh, look what wonderful works. No. I have come to do the works of my father. 
24:24 He never took an honor upon himself. Think of this. He never worked a miracle for himself. Turn that stone into bread. You look hungry. He would not do it for a dozen reasons, but one. He never selfishly enacted a miracle. 
24:40 Never once. Never once. I suppose there's one that could be. Debatable, but I'll stick by my guns. Never once. Never once a miracle on behalf of himself. And he did not proclaim himself a great high priest. 
25:00 Jesus did not. That's the point. Well, now, I've just told you how Jesus always elevates the Father. I'm going to give you another little nugget. And the Holy Ghost always uplifts Jesus. Jesus said when he's come, he will speak of me. 
25:21 He will glorify me, he will exalt me. And that's exactly what the Holy Ghost has done for 2000. If you're ever in a meeting, a revival, a jubilee, whatever. If you're ever in a meeting and it's all Holy Ghost, holy Ghost, holy Ghost, holy Ghost. 
25:38 Hallelujah. Holy Ghost. You are not. In the presence of the real Holy Ghost of God. You know why? The Holy Ghost never will in liberty promote exalting himself. He always exalts the Lord. He always magnifies the Lord. 
26:01 While I'm saying this about Jesus'great High Priest. How that? Jesus is greater than Aaron? The Holy Ghost in me is just exalt in the Lord. Go ahead, Brother Bagwell, tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him if you will. 
26:14 The Holy Ghost prays through me. Hallelujah, Jesus. Prays for me from glory. Verse five. Christ glorified not himself to be made high priest. But he that said unto him, who did glorify, who did make Jesus high priest? 
26:36 He that said unto him I'll just go ahead and answer it. It's God. God the father. What did the Father say to him, preacher? End of verse five. Thou art my son, today have I begotten thee. Jesus had to be begotten of God. 
26:58 He had to be God's only begotten son sent into this world in order to be the high priest who glorified not himself, but was glorified of the Father. Thou art my son, today have I begotten thee. That is a quote from psalm two. 
27:26 Hebrews has already used psalm two. Let me see if I can find it. Chapter one, verse five. Under which of the angels did God ever say Thou art my son? Nine. God never called an angel his son. Unto which of the angels said, thou. 
27:48 Art my son, this day have I begotten thee. Hebrews, chapter one, verse five, is using. Psalm two to prove Jesus is divine. Jesus is the son of God. And now it is using the same verse to prove Jesus is begotten of God. 
28:07 Jesus is the great high priest for us believers who have trusted him as our Savior, this day have I begotten thee. Now, initially, 20 years ago, 25 years. Ago, I would have preached, this day. Have I begotten thee. 
28:25 I'd say that's the day of Jesus birth. And indeed he was virgin born. But in Acts two, when Peter applied this, and again in Acts 13, when. Paul applies these very words, thou art my son. This day have I forgotten thee. 
28:41 All of them quoting from Psalm two, they apply it to the resurrection of Jesus son, you've been dead three days and three nights. Up from the grave. Come out of the grave. By divine decree, I raise you from the dead. 
28:59 This day have I begotten thee. Jesus is God's son, sent to earth. Sent to earth to live sinlessly, to die vicariously. That means in my place and in your place, to be raised literally, to be raised physically, and then 40 days. 
29:20 Later to ascend all the way to. Heaven to become my great high priest. I don't know how to say it. It's a package deal. My virgin born savior, my crucified Lord, my buried. Precious Jesus, but my gloriously raised from the dead. 
29:39 And then my ascended a package deal. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus in a human glorified now body. Jesus, my great high priest. So much better than Aaron. Aaron, you ready for the talk? No. I have to offer that offering for myself first. 
29:57 Then I'll be ready. And yet Jesus never had to offer one. One drop the blood for himself. He's a sinly savior. And he was ready from day one. And he died. I need an amen here once for all. I'll put it this way. 
30:15 I need a bunch of amens here. He'll never die again. He shed his butt. It just beats all I've ever seen. He is both the priest he offered himself. I laid down my life, Jesus said. And then he is the sacrifice. 
30:32 He is the Lamb of God. Father, I am willing to be made. Sin for them, though I knew no. Set death on calvary. Hallelujah. And because of that because of that he has been not of his own accord raised to glory, ascended to glory and serves right now as my great high priest. 
31:03 I want to show you something. As I finish today. Hadn't even thought about going here. I want to go to Psalm 110 very quickly to be quoted. If not tomorrow night, the next night. Psalm 110. I'm trying to get to it as quickly as I can. 
31:27 It describes what happens when Jesus ascends to heaven. He's left this earth. He goes miraculously through the air. A cloud receives him out of their sight. And when he got there, the Lord said unto my Lord God the Father said unto God the Son, sit thou at my right hand. 
31:56 Jesus didn't go to heaven and say, y'all get out of the way. I'm sitting over there on throne. No. The Lord God Almighty said, son, good job. Welcome home. You did it right. The devil's defeated the church. 
32:14 The church people can be saved. Lives can be changed. Heaven can be populated. Hell can be robbed. Son invitation. Sit at my right hand. I want you to sit here co rule, co reign with me. Sit here at the throne of grace and intercede for those who are being saved. 
32:39 One of these days, I'm going to make all your enemies. I'm going to put them under your feet. I'm going to make them your footstool. 32 minutes in five verses, looking at Aaron. Aaron was God's chosen high priest. 
33:01 Why does he have to tell me so much about Aaron? Preacher? He's writing to the Hebrews. This is the epistle to the Hebrews. And that's on their minds. That's all they've ever known. The priesthood of Aaron. 
33:13 Now they're being introduced to the priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's covering the history. Then he covers the glorious ways in which Jesus I'll just take an amen. Is the perfect high priest. 
33:30 Indeed, the great. High Priest and I want to close today, reminding us he has interceded for us today. He has prayed for us today. That word interceding is amazing. I'll share it with you. Then we're going to pray. 
33:54 There are several Bible words that carry this connotation. So will have to look at it in context. To intercede literally means to drop in on to drop in on. Hebrews seven tells us Jesus right now is living. 
34:13 Romans 510 says, we're saved, we're delivered. We're given victory every day by his life. By his life. Mom glad he's alive right now. Glad he didn't go to heaven and retire. I'm glad he's my great high priest. 
34:28 Glory to his name. And he makes intercession for me. That means today in my moments of weakness, tomorrow when I go through a crisis, jesus making intercession drops in, drops in, drops in on me. You ever been in a low moment? 
34:48 You felt like you couldn't go any further and all of a sudden, boom, there it was. There was the strength, there was the answer, there was the impetus, there was the encouragement. There was the it's your Heavenly High Priest praying for you and meeting your needs as they arise. 
35:08 Peter, Satan wants to desires. He wants to sift you his wheat. He wants to destroy your faith. But boom. I have prayed for you that your faith will not fail. And I've got some news for you, Peter's. Faith did not fail. 
35:23 And when you're strengthened, when you're converted, when you get the victory, strengthened your brethren. Hallelujah. So much better than Aaron, so much better than the old covenant economy. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus we sing sweetest name I know sweetest friend of God most powerful friend of God my Savior, my Lord, my God hallelujah, hallelujah to his name every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men into things pertaining to God that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
36:10 That's what they serve. You can't be a high priest without the altar. The altar necessity if you're going to be a high priest. There's an altar in there somewhere. Jesus alters calvary where he offered Himself in a human body. 
36:25 Now he can be my high priest. Aaron's place was the burn offering or the altar or the golden incense altar, but it's got to be an altar. He can now have compassion. Limit to compassion, Aaron. Unlem me to compassion Jesus on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way, on those who've drifted that He Himself, because He Himself is compassed with iniquity. 
36:55 The only person who knows my infirmities, my weaknesses and did not have to worry about his own weaknesses is Jesus. Tempted in all points like as we yet without sin and by reason hereof he ought. As for the people, Aaron had to offer also for himself, he had to offer for sins. 
37:18 No man takes that honor to Himself. God called Aaron. God put him into place. But then here's Jesus. Here's Jesus. He is contrasting. He is comparing, and he's going to do it for paragraphs. Aaron and Jesus. 
37:33 Aaron and Jesus. Then there'll be Melchizedek and Jesus. Melchizedek. It gets rather complex, chapters five through ten, but it's oh, my if you enjoy bragging on Jesus, if you enjoy exalting Jesus, you're going to love it. 
37:48 Christ glorified not himself, never has, never will. Holy Ghost will do that. He's been made a high priest by his father. Thou art my son. Today I raised you from the grave to bring you to heaven so you can sit on my right hand and intercede for our people. 
38:06 Thou art my son. Today I have begotten thee I feel him praying for me right now, y'all. Excuse me. Boom just comes in and helps me and strengthens me. I praise him for his current high priestly ministry. 
38:26 I got a prayer verse I'd like to use today. Luke 321. Now, when people were being baptized, when all the people were baptized, it came to pass jesus also being baptized and praying. The heaven was opened. 
38:50 Here's my point today, and I'm fixing to pray. As Jesus was being baptized as a big step, big move, suffered to fulfill all righteousness, he was praying as well. Here's my point. Praying while you're doing all other things. 
39:08 Praying while you're doing other things. Heavenly Father, teach me to pray. Teach me to multitask. Teach me to pray as I'm driving my car, not with my eyes closed, but teach me to pray. As I'm driving my car teach me to pray as I'm straightening out the books on the shelf teach me to pray without ceasing jesus did. 
39:34 Even while he's being baptized, he prayed. Granted. Lord, give us that. Pray without ceasing. Paul encouraged us. Help us to learn to pray consistently. We know you hear an answer. In Jesus name amen. 
39:50 I pray. Today's lesson has been a blessing. Let me know.
