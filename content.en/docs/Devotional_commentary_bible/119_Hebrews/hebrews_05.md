5:1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:  
5:2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.  
5:3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.  
5:4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.  
5:5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.  

5:6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  
5:7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;  
5:8 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;  
5:9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;  
5:10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.  

5:11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.  
5:12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.  
5:13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.  
5:14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

5:1 凡从人间挑选的大祭司、是奉派替人办理属　神的事、为要献上礼物、和赎罪祭。〔或作要为罪献上礼物和祭物〕
5:2 他能体谅那愚蒙的、和失迷的人、因为他自己也是被软弱所困。  
5:3 故此他理当为百姓和自己献祭赎罪。  
5:4 这大祭司的尊荣、没有人自取、惟要蒙　神所召、像亚伦一样。  
5:5 如此、基督也不是自取荣耀作大祭司、乃是在乎向他说『你是我的儿子、我今日生你。』的那一位。  
 
5:6 就如经上又有一处说、『你是照着麦基洗德的等次永远为祭司。』  
5:7 基督在肉体的时候、既大声哀哭、流泪祷告恳求那能救他免死的主、就因他的虔诚、蒙了应允。  
5:8 他虽然为儿子、还是因所受的苦难学了顺从。  
5:9 他既得以完全、就为凡顺从他的人、成了永远得救的根源。  
5:10 并蒙　神照着麦基洗德的等次称他为大祭司。  
 
5:11 论到麦基洗德、我们有好些话、并且难以解明、因为你们听不进去。  
5:12 看你们学习的工夫、本该作师傅、谁知还得有人将　神圣言小学的开端、另教导你们。并且成了那必须吃奶、不能吃干粮的人。  
5:13 凡只能吃奶的、都不熟练仁义的道理。因为他是婴孩。  
5:14 惟独长大成人的、才能吃干粮、他们的心窍、习练得通达、就能分辨好歹了。

      <h2>Hebrews 5:1-5 ... Aaron and Jesus, both High Priests ... but Jesus is far superior!</h2>
      <p>
00:01 Ah. Join me for class today. Our text is found in Hebrews, chapter five. Hebrews, chapter five, in fact. And I debated on how many verses to try to cover but prayerfully. I've decided we're going to cover the first five verses of Hebrews five. 
<br>
00:29 Hebrews five. Chapter five begins an expanse of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 six chapters, chapters five through chapter number ten, <b>giving some detail about the high priestly ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>. I think this may be the reason what we're about to begin studying, why the book of Hebrews is often neglected. 
<br>
01:06 All that Old Testament history, all that about the great high priesthood, I don't understand it. Paul even accuses these Hebrews of not having matured enough to be able to comprehend our Lord's present day ministry on our bay(?). 
<br>
01:30 Told them they were dull of hearing. Let me read our text. And granted, it does get complex, does get involved. For every high priest taken among men now, these are human beings. Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men. 
<br>
02:00 In the things pertaining to God that he may what's the job of the high priest? Jewish. He's not talking about gentile priest of any kind. <b>Jewish high priest</b>. That he may offer that <b>he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin</b>. 
<br>
02:25 The altar is his major place of business, his major center of activity. The altar that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. Verse two. Who can have compassion on the ignorant? Aaron, his son Eliezer, all the high priests of Israel, they could have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way. 
<br>
03:06 I'll explain that or try to. For that he himself, the earthly high priest, he himself also is compassed with infirmity. Verse three and by reason hereof he ought as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins. 
<br>03:34 That verse just said Aaron had to offer sacrifices for his own sins before he could offer sacrifices for the sins of Israel, of the nation. Verse four, now no man Aaron didn't no man taketh this honor unto himself. 
<br>
03:58 You do not volunteer for the high priesthood. But he that is called of God, as was Aaron. We have four verses on the it's an adjective. Let's get used to it. Aaronic priesthood. <b>The priesthood first filled the high priesthood first filled by Aaron</b>. 
<br>
04:25 Now verse five. So also Christ. So also Christ. Paul didn't call him Jesus. Here Christ. <u class = "red">Christos</u> God's anointed so also Christ glorified not himself never glorified not himself to be made a high priest. 
<br>
04:56 Jesus did not take on his ministry of high priesthood on his own. It was not a personal initiative. Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest. But he that said unto him under who it is going to be talking to the son. 
<br>
05:18 Thou art my son, today have I begotten thee. Today have I begotten thee. We look for four verses at Aaron and then one verse we notice Jesus, our great high priest. Let's wade into, let's do the vocabulary first, if we could. 
<br>
05:52 For every high priest. Remember, high priest. Like Michael is the archangel. The word here the Ark priest, the top priest, the eminent priest, the priest who will go for the people of Israel into the holy of Holies. 
<br>06:16 On the Day of Atonement, every high priest taken from among men, <u class = "red">lombano</u> reached out and grabbed by the hand taken from among men. God chose Aaron to be high priest. When Aaron died, his son Eliezer became high priest. 
<br>06:43 Taken from among men. And probably more than just the verb taken, god chose them. God called them. God ordained them is the idea from among men. Aaron had to be a member of the Jewish nation. Not only that, Aaron had to be of the tribe of Levi. 
<br>
07:10 No other tribe, God's idea, God's command, God's word. No other tribe could serve as a high priest. All the priests were Levites, descendants of Aaron. Taken from among men. And I just want to add something very quickly. 
<br>
07:32 Just like Aaron, the high priest of Israel had to be a human being taken from among men. So did the Lord Jesus Christ, <b>my great high priest, have to come from among men. That's why God sent him to be virgin born</b>. 
<br>
07:50 That's why God sent him so he could be touched with the feeling of my infirmities. That's why God sent him so Jesus in a human body could do <b>what Adam failed to do in a human body defeat the devil</b> so that Jesus in a human body could do what none of the rest of us could have ever done, live sinlessly. 
<br>
08:16 Jesus in a human body accomplished everything mankind had failed to do. And as such, taken from among men. God had to become flesh so that Jesus could be my great high priest. Back to verse one every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men. 
<br>
08:45 Ordained for men that does carry the idea of ordination, sanctification, set apart, put in office. Let me glance at the katahistomy <u class = "red">histamine</u> means to sit. God picked, chose Aaron out of the children of men, out of the children of Israel, out of the tribe of and then set him down, in the high priest, ordained him in the high priesthood. 
<br>
09:16 Now why did God do that? And remember what a priest does? a priest through the blood sacrifices tends to say this is what God expects of us. He brings God to earth. In that sense, God demands blood atonement. 
<br>
09:33 And then when I bring the blood and the blood is shed and I say, apply that blood to my life, Lord, I lay my hand on the head of that innocent lamb identifying that's me getting to go to I get ushered into God's presence, work at the altar. 
<br>
09:51 Major job of the high priest. And Jesus'greatest job. Jesus'greatest job, as our great high priest occurred at the altar. Not the altar in the Jewish temple. They hated him there. <b>The altar called the Old Rugged Cross of Calvary</b>, where Jesus not only offered himself as our great high priest, but he died himself. 
<br>
10:19 He is is both the offerer the high priest and the sacrifice, the Lamb of God. Hallelujah. What a savior he's ordained of God, set apart of God that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sin. That's two different words. 
<br>
10:41 Gifts and sacrifices for sin. The word therefore gifts. Sometimes gifts and sacrifices are used interchangeably, but I strongly think not here. The word sacrifice is <u class = "red">thusea</u>, and it means blood sacrifice, torture. 
<br>
11:06 Throat slit, blood splattering everywhere. It's a little heartbeat flushes out that last bit of blood and agony. Gifts and sacrifices. The gifts. Probably not a hint of blood in that word. Gifts. The gifts, probably I can't go back. 
<br>
11:27 We don't have time today. Leviticus one through seven. That is probably <b>the meal offering</b>. Picture of Jesus, worshipping his father, living for his father, sacrificing himself to his father. But not a drop of blood in that offering. 
<br>
11:45 It has to be matched with a whole burn offering. That does have blood. Has to be matched with a sin offering. It does have blood. This is what it means. I need an amen. Jesus lived right and then he died right? 
<br>
11:59 Let me reverse it. If he hadn't lived right, he couldn't have died right? He lived sinlessly so he could die vicariously. And that priest will offer the meat offering. But it is a meal offering made of fine flour can't get into that. 
<br>
12:17 And <u class = "red">thusea</u> sacrifices for sins. If I take that and apply it to my Savior dying on the cross of Calvary, Jesus can lift his eyes to his Father gifts. Gifts. The miller father in my flesh. I never sinned. 
<br>
12:37 In my flesh. I perfectly obeyed you. In my flesh I give it to you spotless. And it's got frankincense. Smells good to God. God is pleased. And then sacrifices for sin. That's Jesus on the cross. Not only have I lived for you, not only did he give you my body, now give you my blood. 
<br>
12:58 I give you my life. I give you my all for sins. class, Ffr your sins and for my sins. Still talking about Aaron. Brother Bagel can't hardly quit talking about Jesus. Verse two. Who can have compassion on the ignorant? 
<br>
13:23 Aaron and the son of Aaron. When Aaron died the next high priest, they were to have compassion on the ignorant. That word "compassion" is interesting. It uses metron. M-E-T-I-R-O-N. It's Greek word that means a measure of, a little bit of, even as much as is humanly possible to have compassion. 
<br>
13:53 And then the word <b>pathos</b>. As much feeling as he can muster, Aaron, as he served as the great high priest was to have feeling for the poor old sinners that came to him, feeling for those who had disobeyed God. 
<br>
14:09 Unwillingly, unknowingly, actually. But my great high priest oh, I've got to show you this. I've got to show you, High Priest we learned it several lessons ago. Who is touched with the feeling of my infirmity? 
<br>
14:24 That's sympathetic. Oh, Jesus can identify with me. Holy completely. Sympathy, empathy, totally. He walked in the flesh in which I walk. He fought the devil, I fight. he overcame with the word of God, the same word of God I have in my hand. 
<br>
14:48 Aaron it's <b>limited sympathy</b>. Jesus hallelujah. That in all things he might have the preeminence it's unlimited sympathy that he can have compassion on the ignorant. On the ignorant. It's OG no EO. It's the word agnostic. 
<br>
15:16 It means those that don't have this is what it means. I sinned, but I didn't mean to. I sinned, but I didn't realize it. I sinned, but I failed to memorize that command like I should. Sins of ignorance. 
<br>
15:32 The Old Testament says. in the Old Testament, in the old economy, the only forgiveness available at the altar, sins of ignorance, sins that are not willfully committed. We'll probably get to go into that later, but. 
<br>
15:52 That's why our verse says he had compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way. On them that are out of the way. That verb is <u class = "red">planeto</u> on those who have drifted out of orbit, on those who have grown cold and indifferent and gotten too far away from fellowship with the Savior, with the Lord God Almighty. 
<br>
16:23 We are being told Aaron and the High Priest of Israel was effective to some degree, but it was limited because the priests themselves were sinners, were sinners who needed to offer sacrifice for their own sin. 
<br>
16:44 But all when you come to Jesus unlimited priesthood, he did not have to die for his own sins. He is compassionate to the nth degree that I get that verse. He also is compassed with infirmity. He is also compassed with infirmity. 
<br>
17:10 That's the word that means lack of strength, lack of strength. Compass means he will have compassion on those who maybe physically, but definitely spiritually, lack <u class = "red">stamina</u>, lack strength, lack faithfulness to the glory of God. 
<br>
17:37 He himself is compassed with imperfect. Aaron himself to be compassed is the verb to lay down with. He lays down every night with human weakness. Himself. He lays down every night with a body that has. 
<br>
17:51 Propensity to sin. Verse three, and by reason hereof, he ought as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins. Oh, that is going to be repeated again and again, Aaron. Even on the Day of Atonement, one of the first things Aaron had to do was go through a ritual cleansing himself before he could cleanse the people of Israel. 
<br>
18:27 And that's what verse three means. Thank God for the Old Testament priesthood. <b>But it is limited. It is beset by weakness</b>. It can have a measure of compassion, but it can never do what Jesus Christ, the Son of God, can do. 
<br>
18:49 Oh, verse four. And no man taketh this honor unto himself. That's <u class = "red">lombano</u> again. No man taketh this honor unto himself. You do not elect to become a high priest. <b>God will choose you. God will ordain you</b>. 
<br>
19:14 And I'm going to show you in just a minute the apex of tonight's lesson. God chose Jesus. God ordained Jesus to be our great high priest. Just like Jesus got done on the cross what Adam couldn't. Adam lost it all. 
<br>
19:33 Jesus gained it all back and then some on Calvary. So <b>Jesus, my great high priest, has outperformed Aaron and all that the Old Testament priesthood could have ever accomplished. No man taketh this honor</b>. 
<br>
19:49 Well, that's proof that the priesthood is an honor. It is the word. I'll spell it T-I-M-E time a of great value, of great worth, of great esteem. No man take it this honor unto himself. But he that is called of God, he that is called of God, <u class = "red">caleto</u>, he that is called of God, as was Aaron. 
<br>
20:24 God called Caleto. Aaron, you're the one. Moses says he can't speak, says he can't tell. You're the one. You'll be his spokesman. You're going to be the priest. You're going to be the high priest. God called him to that position. 
<br>
20:41 And thank God for the Aaron Priesthood. The Aaronic Priesthood. Because that's how Israel got her sins covered every day of Atonement. Covered for another year and another year and another year. My great high priest. 
<br>
20:58 Thank God he didn't have to die every day of Atonement. He didn't have to kill a lamb every day of Atonement. He didn't have to kill a lamb every morning, the morning sacrifice. He didn't have to kill a lamb every evening. 
<br>
21:10 The evening sacrifice. <b>He is once for all the lamb</b>, once for all the sacrifice. Hallelujah to his name. Verse five, so also Christ, so also Christ, I mentioned it when I read the text. <u class = "red">Christos</u>. So also <b>Christ means the Anointed One</b>. 
<br>
21:35 Literally, it means the one on whom God poured all. That would be the all of the Holy Ghost. That would be the holy. Anointing oil. Aaron's got a whole chapter describing it with him. Psalm 133. All poured out on his head, went down on his beard, went down on his robe, all the way to the bottom, all the way to the skirts of it. 
<br>
21:57 Oh, my. What? All like the dew on Herman. It was just a beautiful it's only got three verses. Psalm 133. It, but now Jesus Christ. I'll need an amen here. John tells me Jesus was anointed as. Nobody else was ever anointed. 
<br>
22:20 <b>In the Old Testament, three offices are anointed, prophets, priests, and kings</b>. You do not see these offices overlapping. King Uzziah tried to become a priest once and God gave him leprosy. It won't work. 
<br>
22:37 God will not allow it to overlap. No, no, but when you come to Jesus, I'm going to need an amen. He is both prophet and priest and king. I need to say that better. He is God's prophet, God's priest and God's king. 
<br>
22:57 See if you'll agree with me. Jesus is prophet. He's the greatest preacher that ever lived. He's the greatest prophet that ever put shoe leather on the face of planet Earth. God ordained king, king of kings, lord of lords. 
<br>
23:12 Anybody believe Jesus is coming back to rule and reign on this earth someday? The anointed king of God. He is prophet. He is king. But, oh, is he priest? He is anointed. He is anointed. As our great high priest. John said, he was anointed without measure, beyond measure of the Holy Ghost of God. 
<br>
23:36 So also Christ glorified not himself. <u class = "red">Doxadzo</u> glorified Jesus. Let me just stop and preach this a minute. Jesus never uplifted himself. Never. Never. He always uplifts his father. One day they were bragging on his words, no, no, these are not my words. 
<br>
24:07 My father gave me the words. One day somebody wanted to brag on his miracles, and he rolled. No, these are not my power. It's my father's power. Oh, look what wonderful works. No. I have come to do the works of my father. 
<br>
24:24 He <b>never took an honor upon himself</b>. Think of this. He never worked a miracle for himself. Turn that stone into bread. You look hungry. He would not do it for a dozen reasons, but one. He never selfishly enacted a miracle. 
<br>
24:40 Never once. Never once. I suppose there's one that could be. Debatable, but I'll stick by my guns. Never once. Never once a miracle on behalf of himself. And he did not proclaim himself a great high priest. 
<br>
25:00 Jesus did not. That's the point. Well, now, I've just told you how Jesus always elevates the Father. I'm going to give you another little nugget. And the Holy Ghost always uplifts Jesus. Jesus said when he's come, he will speak of me. 
<br>
25:21 He will glorify me, he will exalt me. And that's exactly what the Holy Ghost has done for 2000. If you're ever in a meeting, a revival, a jubilee, whatever. If you're ever in a meeting and it's all Holy Ghost, holy Ghost, holy Ghost, holy Ghost. 
<br>
25:38 Hallelujah. Holy Ghost. You are not. In the presence of the real Holy Ghost of God. You know why? <b>The Holy Ghost never will in liberty promote exalting himself</b>. He always exalts the Lord. He always magnifies the Lord. 
<br>
26:01 While I'm saying this about Jesus great High Priest. How that? Jesus is greater than Aaron? The Holy Ghost in me is just exalt in the Lord. Go ahead, Brother Bagwell, tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him if you will. 
<br>
26:14 The Holy Ghost prays through me. Hallelujah, Jesus. Prays for me from glory. Verse five. Christ glorified not himself to be made high priest. But he that said unto him, who did glorify, who did make Jesus high priest? 
<br>
26:36 He that said unto him I'll just go ahead and answer it. It's God. God the father. What did the Father say to him, preacher? End of verse five. Thou art my son, today have I begotten thee. Jesus had to be begotten of God. 
<br>
26:58 He had to be God's only begotten son sent into this world in order to be the high priest who glorified not himself, but was glorified of the Father. Thou art my son, today have I begotten thee. That is a quote from psalm two. 
<br>
27:26 Hebrews has already used psalm two. Let me see if I can find it. Chapter one, verse five. Under which of the angels did God ever say Thou art my son? None. God never called an angel his son. Unto which of the angels said, thou. 
<br>
27:48 Art my son, this day have I begotten thee. Hebrews, chapter one, verse five, is using. Psalm two to prove Jesus is divine. Jesus is the son of God. And now it is using the same verse to prove Jesus is begotten of God. 
<br>
28:07 Jesus is the great high priest for us believers who have trusted him as our Savior, this day have I begotten thee. Now, initially, 20 years ago, 25 years ago, I would have preached, this day. Have I begotten thee. 
<br>
28:25 I'd say that's the day of Jesus birth. And indeed he was virgin born. But in Acts two, when Peter applied this, and again in Acts 13, when. Paul applies these very words, thou art my son. This day have I forgotten thee. 
<br>
28:41 All of them quoting from Psalm two, they apply it to the resurrection of Jesus son, you've been dead three days and three nights. Up from the grave. Come out of the grave. By divine decree, I raise you from the dead. 
<br>
28:59 This day have I begotten thee. Jesus is God's son, sent to earth. Sent to earth to live sinlessly, to die vicariously. That means in my place and in your place, to be raised literally, to be raised physically, and then 40 days. 
<br>
29:20 Later to ascend all the way to. Heaven to become my great high priest. I don't know how to say it. It's a package deal. My virgin born savior, my crucified Lord, my buried. Precious Jesus, but my gloriously raised from the dead. 
<br>
29:39 And then my ascended a package deal. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus in a human glorified now body. Jesus, my great high priest. So much better than Aaron. Aaron, you ready for the talk? No. I have to offer that offering for myself first. 
<br>
29:57 Then I'll be ready. And yet Jesus never had to offer one. One drop the blood for himself. He's a sinly savior. And he was ready from day one. And he died. I need an amen here once for all. I'll put it this way. 
<br>
30:15 I need a bunch of amens here. He'll never die again. He shed his butt. It just beats all I've ever seen. He is both the priest he offered himself. I laid down my life, Jesus said. And then he is the sacrifice. 
<br>
30:32 He is the Lamb of God. Father, I am willing to be made. Sin for them, though I knew no. Set death on calvary. Hallelujah. And because of that, because of that, he has been not of his own accord raised to glory, ascended to glory and serves right now as my great high priest. 
<br>
31:03 I want to show you something. As I finish today. Hadn't even thought about going here. I want to go to Psalm 110 very quickly, to be quoted. If not tomorrow night, the next night. Psalm 110. I'm trying to get to it as quickly as I can. 
<br>
31:27 It describes what happens when Jesus ascends to heaven. He's left this earth. He goes miraculously through the air. A cloud receives him out of their sight. And when he got there, the Lord said unto my Lord God the Father said unto God the Son, sit thou at my right hand. 
<br>
31:56 Jesus didn't go to heaven and say, y'all get out of the way. I'm sitting over there on throne. No. The Lord God Almighty said, son, good job. Welcome home. You did it right. The devil's defeated. the church. 
<br>
32:14 The church people can be saved. Lives can be changed. Heaven can be populated. Hell can be robbed. Son invitation. Sit at my right hand. I want you to sit here co-rule, co-reign with me. Sit here at the throne of grace and intercede for those who are being saved. 
<br>
32:39 One of these days, I'm going to make all your enemies. I'm going to put them under your feet. I'm going to make them your footstool. 32 minutes in five verses, looking at Aaron. Aaron was God's chosen high priest. 
<br>
33:01 Why does he have to tell me so much about Aaron? Preacher? He's writing to the Hebrews. This is the epistle to the Hebrews. And that's on their minds. That's all they've ever known. The priesthood of Aaron. 
<br>
33:13 Now they're being introduced to the priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's covering the history. Then he covers the glorious ways in which Jesus I'll just take an amen. Is the perfect high priest. 
<br>
33:30 Indeed, the great. High Priest and I want to close today, reminding us he has interceded for us today. He has prayed for us today. That word interceding is amazing. I'll share it with you. Then we're going to pray. 
<br>
33:54 There are several Bible words that carry this connotation. So will have to look at it in context. To intercede literally means to drop in on, to drop in on. Hebrews seven tells us Jesus right now is living. 
<br>
34:13 Romans 5:10 says, we're saved, we're delivered. We're given victory every day by his life. By his life. Mom glad he's alive right now. Glad he didn't go to heaven and retire. I'm glad he's my great high priest. 
<br>
34:28 Glory to his name. And he makes intercession for me. That means today in my moments of weakness, tomorrow when I go through a crisis, Jesus making intercession drops in, drops in, drops in on me. You ever been in a low moment? 
<br>
34:48 You felt like you couldn't go any further and all of a sudden, boom, there it was. There was the strength, there was the answer, there was the impetus, there was the encouragement. There was the it's your Heavenly High Priest praying for you and meeting your needs as they arise. 
<br>
35:08 Peter, Satan wants to desires. He wants to sift you his wheat. He wants to destroy your faith. But boom. I have prayed for you that your faith will not fail. And I've got some news for you, Peter's. Faith did not fail. 
<br>
35:23 And when you're strengthened, when you're converted, when you get the victory, strengthened your brethren. Hallelujah. So much better than Aaron, so much better than the old covenant economy. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, we sing sweetest name I know, sweetest friend of God, most powerful friend of God my Savior, my Lord, my God hallelujah, hallelujah to his name. Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men into things pertaining to God that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
<br>
36:10 That's what they serve. You can't be a high priest without the altar. The altar necessity if you're going to be a high priest. There's an altar in there somewhere. Jesus alters calvary where he offered Himself in a human body. 
<br>
36:25 Now he can be my high priest. Aaron's place was the burn offering or the altar or the golden incense altar, but it's got to be an altar. He can now have compassion. Limit to compassion, Aaron. Unlimit me to compassion Jesus on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way, on those who've drifted that He Himself, because He Himself is compassed with iniquity. 
<br>
36:55 The only person who knows my infirmities, my weaknesses and did not have to worry about his own weaknesses is Jesus. Tempted in all points like as we yet without sin and by reason hereof he ought. As for the people, Aaron had to offer also for himself, he had to offer for sins. 
<br>
37:18 No man takes that honor to Himself. God called Aaron. God put him into place. But then here's Jesus. Here's Jesus. He is contrasting. He is comparing, and he's going to do it for paragraphs. Aaron and Jesus. 
<br>
37:33 Aaron and Jesus. Then there'll be Melchizedek and Jesus. Melchizedek. It gets rather complex, chapters five through ten, but it's oh, my if you enjoy bragging on Jesus, if you enjoy exalting Jesus, you're going to love it. 
<br>
37:48 Christ glorified not himself, never has, never will. Holy Ghost will do that. He's been made a high priest by his father. Thou art my son. Today I raised you from the grave to bring you to heaven so you can sit on my right hand and intercede for our people. 
<br>
38:06 Thou art my son. Today I have begotten thee, I feel him praying for me right now, y'all. Excuse me. Boom just comes in and helps me and strengthens me. I praise him for his current high priestly ministry. 
<br>
38:26 I got a prayer verse I'd like to use today. Luke 3:21. Now, when people were being baptized, when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, Jesus also being baptized and praying. The heaven was opened. 
<br>
38:50 Here's my point today, and I'm fixing to pray. As Jesus was being baptized as a big step, big move, suffered to fulfill all righteousness, he was praying as well. Here's my point. Praying while you're doing all other things. 
<br>
39:08 Praying while you're doing other things. Heavenly Father, teach me to pray. Teach me to multitask. Teach me to pray as I'm driving my car, not with my eyes closed, but teach me to pray. As I'm driving my car teach me to pray as I'm straightening out the books on the shelf teach me to pray without ceasing Jesus did. 
<br>
39:34 Even while he's being baptized, he prayed. Granted. Lord, give us that. Pray without ceasing. Paul encouraged us. Help us to learn to pray consistently. We know you hear an answer. In Jesus name amen. 
<br>
39:50 I pray. Today's lesson has been a blessing. Let me know.

      <h2>Hebrews 5:6-11, "In the days of his flesh!" (A glimpse at Gethsemane)</h2>
      <p>
<br>00:01 It. Let's take our Bibles and go to Hebrews chapter number five. And we will begin at verse number six. Our text tonight will cover verses six through ten. The Lord willing. Hebrews five, six through ten. 
<br>
00:25 You I want to thank you for the overwhelming response. I was not able to teach a class yesterday. Weak, sick, fevered. We have learned. Our test results are back. Debbie and I have COVID, and we're battling the virus right now. 
<br>
00:48 We're quarantined, of course, here at home. I am still weak today. But these verses have been so on my heart, and I want to share them with you. They so beautifully exalt. Our Savior, I'd like to ask you to pray for my wife, Debbie's. 
<br>
01:10 Not I don't think Debbie's feeling as well today as even yesterday. Your prayers will be deeply appreciated. Our text employs a little literary technique called inclusio. And all that means we studied it before. 
<br>
01:33 A passage begins and ends with the same thought. It's as though this thought bracket it's. The passage. It is a parentheses around the passage. And that would be verse six. God saying to Jesus, thou art a priest forever. 
<br>
02:00 After the Order of Melchizedek. And then verse ten son, you're called of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. This passage concerns the priesthood of Jesus, the high priesthood of Jesus. 
<br>
02:26 Not for some reason, after the similitude of Aaron, after the likeness the likeness of a man who met Abraham. Genesis 14. We're going to study it in some detail eventually. And his name is Melchizedek. 
<br>
02:48 Jesus high Priestess is patterned after Melchizedek rather than Aaron. This thing begins jesus, our high priest, like Melchizedek. It ends. Jesus, our high priest, like Melchizedek. So now I'm interested. 
<br>
03:09 What's in the middle? What is the meat between this Melchizedek? Slice of bread here and slice of bread? It's the melchizedek sandwich, but Melchizedek is wrapping around what slice of meat? God the Father to God the son. 
<br>
03:34 You're the priest. You're the high priest. You're the great high priest after the order of Melchizedek. We're not going to spend this lesson on Melchizedek. He comes up again and again and again. In these next few paragraphs of Hebrews, we're going to cover him as the Holy Ghost gives us enlightenment, as Paul writes it down. 
<br>
04:02 Keep in mind, though, Jesus is that kind of a high priest. Well, then why these Middle verses, verse seven. Who in the days of his face I think we're being told before we can learn about Jesus high priesthood, what he is doing for us in heaven right now, we're going to have to learn how he became our high priest, how he I'm going to use this word how he earned the position of our great high priest. 
<br>
04:47 And that's the meat of our passage. Who in the days of his flesh that little phrase right there, the days of his flesh, I believe it encompasses from the time Jesus was born until the time he ascended and went back to the Father, the days of his flesh. 
<br>
05:14 We're about to study a beautiful Holy Ghost written summary of Jesus'life on Earth. I'm not saying it's going to cover every no, no. You can't do that in three no, but it's going to cover the salient points, the major points. 
<br>
05:38 Let me give you an example of that done elsewhere. Here is a one verse summary of Jesus life. One Timothy 316. Bogged down talking about the verse a one verse summary of Jesus'life Holy Ghost. Does it occasionally without controversy. 
<br>
06:00 Great is the mystery of Godliness. Here it comes. Here's Jesus God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached under the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and Evie ascension up to glory. 
<br>
06:18 That's one. Timothy, chapter three, verse 16. A one verse summary of Jesus life. We're fixing to get a three verse summary of Jesus life in the days of his flesh. Now, let's look. When he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears. 
<br>
06:49 I realize and I believe that Jesus, God's darling son, was a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. That is a summary of his entire he was hated and he was despised. I understand that, and I agree. Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears. 
<br>
07:24 But I think this is not just teaching us that Jesus often prayed. He did habitually. Mark 135. Write it down and read it. It'll illustrate my point. And not only that. Jesus only prayed at times with prayers and supplication. 
<br>
07:44 Let me give you the vocabulary there with prayers. And supplication Diasis, asking specific things of God the Father. Supplications this one. It is an unusual word there. Supplications. I do not remember it being used anywhere else in the New Testament. 
<br>
08:10 It literally means an olive branch. Putting out an olive branch. It literally means to the point begging. There's something Jesus wanted, Samad, that he is begging. He is begging something from his Heavenly Father. 
<br>
08:28 I believe with all my heart. This is describing the event in the life of Jesus at Gethsemane. At Gethsemane. Let me read it again, see if you could agree. Who in the days of his flesh. It's going to be a summary, but we're focusing on Gethsemane, in fact, that summarizes his life from virgin birth to ascension in the days of his flesh. 
<br>
08:53 But now, particularly when he offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death. Unto him that was able to save him from death. Yes, that's gethsemane. 
<br>
09:17 Jesus, with strong crying and tears and in agony, was praying to his Father. He was praying to the one who could save him from death. And he was heard. God heard him in that he feared. We got to talk about Gethsemane. 
<br>
09:43 There is something about Gethsemane that ties into the high priesthood. Of our savior. He's priest after the order of Melchizedek. He's priest after the order of Melchizedek. But in the days of his flesh in the garden of Gethsemane, he cried out. 
<br>
10:01 He cried out with crying in tears to his father, and his father heard him, and his father saved him from death. Now, Brother Bagel, that really doesn't make sense. Okay, I'm going to give you what 50% of the commentators say about Gethsemane. 
<br>
10:25 I do not agree with them. They say that when Gethsemane came, when Jesus got that near the cross, that Jesus got cold feet, that Jesus began to fear that Jesus turned turned they won't use this word, but it's exactly what they mean. 
<br>
10:46 That Jesus turned chicken and he was begging God that he wouldn't have to die, that he was trying to wiggle out somehow of his obligation, of his commitment. I don't know. He had an obligation of his commitment to go to Calvary. 
<br>
11:06 Well, he did have an obligation. He said to Nicodemus, the Son of man must is obligated to be lifted up on that cross. You will never convince this Bible teacher. You will never convince this preacher jesus got chicken on the eve of Calvary. 
<br>
11:25 No, I will never, never believe it. Not when there are verses in John that says, and Jesus, not that he did not have apprehension, my soul is troubled, but for this cause came I. He came to die on Calvary. 
<br>
11:44 He's determined. To die on Calvary. I do not believe Gethsemane is his trying to escape death. Half the Bible commentators say that's exactly what he's trying to do wrong. I told you something the other day. 
<br>
12:03 I told you, Brother Bagel, when presented with a choice, will always take the choice that makes Jesus look best. That most exalts says, you're never going to get me to sign on the dotted line. That Jesus was trying to escape Calvary, that he got scared, that he became fearful. 
<br>
12:21 No. The rest of the commentators, I'd say 40% the better commentators, in my opinion, say, no. Jesus didn't get cold feet in the sense that he was trying to get out of it, but he was asking God to save him from death. 
<br>
12:41 Lord, I know I'm going to die on the cross. I understand that. But, Lord, then get me out of the ground. Raise me from the dead. Make the resurrection real. They say that's what he was praying for. And so it says he was heard. 
<br>
12:53 He was heard. God delivered him from death. I like that view better, but I still don't think that's what was going on. I still don't think that's what was going on, Brother Bagel. What do you think was going on? 
<br>
13:09 By the way, Jesus already had the promise that he would be raised from the dead. Jesus did not pray that God would raise him from the dead. Jesus has known. For thou wilt I'm reading Psalm 16. This is Jesus talking to his father. 
<br>
13:34 Thou wilt not leave my soul in the grave. Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption. I won't rot. You. Thou wilt show me the path of life. You'll come get me in the grave and show me the path of life. 
<br>
13:49 You will raise me from the dead, and I'll come see you in thy presence. It's fullness of joy. I don't believe that he was begging God to raise him from the dead. He always already had the peace and the God given assurance he would be raised from the dead. 
<br>
14:08 Brother Bagwell, you have wrecked all of the theologians. You have wrecked all the professors. What in the world do you think is going on? If you don't think he got chicken cold feet trying to get out of the cross and you don't think he's praying, god, I know I'm going to die. 
<br>
14:22 I'm willing to die. But, oh, Father, if you would raise me from the dead, deliver me ultimately from what do you think is going on? Exactly what this verse says. Watch in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications he is praying. 
<br>
14:47 Luke said his prayers. Luke said as he prayed he prayed so earnestly his sweat became as drops of blood. And that word supper he's begging. He's begging something from his Father. And it plainly says and the Father heard him, granted him his request strong crying and tears under the hymn that was able to save him from death. 
<br>
15:18 Here's what I believe Hebrews is teaching and here's what I believe was going on in the life of our precious Savior. Would you allow me just to get a little swallow of water? I've been looking forward to sharing this with you. 
<br>
15:33 Some of you are going to disagree. I'm going to love you anyway. But it's the highest view of Jesus possible, I believe. I believe in the Garden of Gethsemane, he was facing imminent death right then and right there. 
<br>
15:52 Let me read it with strong crying and tears to the one that was able to save him from death. Not death a day later, not death hours later on the cross from death right then. I have read some medical reports to this effect that when a man is under such intense pressure, such intense turmoil, such intense conflict, if he ever begins to sweat blood, he is close to a mortal stroke. 
<br>
16:32 He is close to dropping dead. Here's what I believe is going on. I believe in the Garden of Gethsemane, the Devil showed up one more time in the life of Jesus and tried to kill him. Tried to kill him then and there. 
<br>
16:55 I have no doubt. I can show you place after place in Jesus'life where the Devil tried to extinguish Jesus as a human being, as the God man tried to kill him. Prior to Calvary, the Devil would have stopped Jesus from going to the cross any way he could have, because the Devil knows the cross is his defeat. 
<br>
17:21 Blood of Jesus being shed is the downfall of Satan and all sin and all wickedness. Hey, I got to show you something. If I'm anywhere near right that's two times the Devil brought an onslaught against Jesus face. 
<br>
17:42 To face once was the 40 days in the wilderness. Three times turn the stones into bread. I'm not going to review them all. You know the three prongs of the temptation. Jump on the temple, bow down and worship me three times. 
<br>
17:56 And Jesus defeated him there three times. With the word of God. It is written. It is written, it is written. And now the devil is on slaughtering Jesus, fighting Jesus again, coming against Jesus. With all the power of darkness. 
<br>
18:20 And Jesus knew it. He said, the prince of this world comes against me. And this time Jesus defeats the devil with prayer, prayer, prayer. Three times he prayed using the same words we're told three times. 
<br>
18:38 First time the devil tried to defeat the Lord Jesus Christ. It is written in the word of God. Last time, hearing guests and tried to kill him. Prayer, prayer, prayer. Those are two tools for overcoming the temptation of the devil. 
<br>
18:54 That old book, the Word of God. And prayer, prayer, prayer. Pleading the blood of the Lord Jesus. And they overcame the antichrist Revelation Twelve by the blood of the Lamb and. The word of their testimony. 
<br>
19:12 Preacher I'll think about it. Never heard anything like that in all my life before. This is not a private interpretation. I've not come up with this on my own. I've heard men of God preach it. I've thought it through very few, but. 
<br>
19:29 In my heart that's what's going on. Oh Father, would you save me from death? Would you agree with this? I think the devil tried to kill Jesus before he was born. A young virgin girl riding a donkey from her hometown all the way to Bethlehem. 
<br>
19:52 That little body shaking as that little animal. No doubt Joseph led him. If the devil could, he would have brought a miscarriage in Jesus. God's son would have never come. And then they got into Bethlehem and there's no place for them to stay. 
<br>
20:11 None of Joseph's relatives would give them access. And the baby is born in a stable, in a cave. The baby is born and laid in a cow trough. A manger. You ever heard of infection? You ever heard of it? 
<br>
20:25 Devil would love to kill him in infancy. And then have you heard of Herod's henchmen? Herod's assassins killing all the little baby boys he was after Jesus. The devil's trying to kill the Lord Jesus Christ. 
<br>
20:40 God had Joseph take him to Egypt until that Herod was dead. First sermon Jesus ever preached, he preached from Isaiah 61. They got so mad at him, they took him outside his hometown, Nazareth. Tried to push him over a cliff. 
<br>
20:56 That's in Luke Four tried to kill him. The Devil tried to kill him before he ever got to the Old Rugged Cross. How many times? I know of two. They picked up stones to stone him, the Pharisees, and he passed through the midst. 
<br>
21:08 The Devil wanted Jesus stoned to death before he got to Calvary. The flogging. The scourging. Many a man never survived live discouraging. There are records in Roman history. The Cat of Nine tails ripped intestines open, bowels spilled out on the ground and men convulsed to death. 
<br>
21:29 Devil's trying to kill him at the whipping post. And now one last lunge at gethsemane I'll kill. Okay. And Jesus didn't want to die that short of his goal. Hallelujah. He didn't want to die that short of calvary. 
<br>
21:48 And I thank Jesus with strong crying in tears, offering an olive branch to the Father. I beg you, Father, don't let me die here. Spare my life. Let me live. Don't let me die here and now. Let me go to that cross. 
<br>
22:02 Let them nail me to the let me shed my blood so sinners can be saved by the grace of God. Strong crying in tears saved me from death. And he was heard. He was heard in that he feared. Almighty God said, Son, you have learned obedience. 
<br>
22:24 You have learned that obedience is not just something passive. Mary the Virgin, be it unto me according to Thy word. That's obedience, that's beautiful obedience, but that's passive obedience. Be it unto me according to Thy word. 
<br>
22:38 Jesus goes so much far beyond that. Jesus says, Father, not just be it unto me according to Thy word. This is not some milk toast, lord, I'll die for you. You asked me to, and I'm going to do. He said, Father, I'll fight for it. 
<br>
22:55 Don't let me die here. Get the devil out of here. Defeat the devil. Oh, I plead your power and your strength and let me go to the cross I'm actively pursuing. Let me die there. Let me do it the right way. 
<br>
23:07 Let me become the redeemer for lost mankind. And he was heard and that he feared. Verse eight. Though he were a son, though he and that's a capital S though he's the darling Son of God, he learned obedience. 
<br>
23:25 He learned obedience. By the things that he suffered what he suffered there in the garden of Gethsemane. And then he pursued obeying God. He didn't roll over and yield and say he said, father, I'll fight to get to Calvary. 
<br>
23:41 I ask you to remove the devil and give me and let me go and down that cross so souls can be saved. The highest view of Jesus I could ever imagine. Verse nine and being made perfect. And being made perfect. 
<br>
24:04 I want to go back to my vocabulary, if I can. And being made perfect. It's teleo. It is the word that means having come to the place of total obedience and being made perfect. Here's one level of obedience yell God, I'll do it. 
<br>
24:29 You told me to. I really have no choice. Here's another level of obedience. Here am I. Send me. I'm joyfully willing, Lord. Here's another level of obedience. I'll fight for it. There's something trying to keep me from obeying get thee hint Satan. 
<br>
24:47 Get out of here. I'm going to obey. Lord, don't let me die in Gethsemane. Spare my life a few more hours. The soldiers are on the way. I want to live long enough to spill to pour out that's a long verb that implies an accident. 
<br>
25:03 To pour out to joyously give my blood so that the world can be saved, can be born again by the grace of God. Being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all those to all those. Get that word? 
<br>
25:27 Author. He became the author. The author. Oh, my. There's a word I'm looking for a noun. I would expect it's not here. Being made the author. Atios. Atios. It's a Hopox. It comes from the verb means it's only used once. 
<br>
25:45 In this sense, it comes from ateo, and it means to ask to begging, to crave. Do you know why? He's the author of our salvation? He begged for it. He craved it. He asked it. It's not just a matter god told Jesus to die on the cross. 
<br>
26:03 He would have. I've come to do thy will. Oh, God. This is a matter of Jesus fighting for it. Let me do it. Don't let the devil kill me here. Oh, God, I'm going to persevere. I'm going to die on the cross. 
<br>
26:16 If you'll spare my life, I'll become the author. A big, big beg let me do it. Of eternal salvation to those who believe the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior. Oh, my. I admire him and I love him. If I'm anywhere near right, I've got peace in my heart about jesus fought to be my savior. 
<br>
26:38 He fought not to die. And he begged, oh, God, you're able to deliver me from death. And God heard him. God heard him. Look at it. God heard him in verse seven. God heard him because Jesus was reverent. 
<br>
26:49 Jesus was respectful. Jesus was holy. And though he's a son, he learned. He became a disciple of obedience. Active obedience. I'll go to the cross. He fought for it. He begged for it. And hallelujah. 
<br>
27:05 He craved it. And he achieved it. Our Savior. Our Savior. And that's why the text is wrapped. He's our high priest. Do you know why he's our High Priest now? Because he lived right. In the days of his flesh. 
<br>
27:26 Do you know why he's our High Priest now? Because he died right on the old. Rugged cross and do you know why. He'S our High Priest right now? Because he fought to die right for you and me. Because he struggled to get through gethsemane. 
<br>
27:40 To get to the Old Rugged Cross. To pour out his life blood that. We hallelujah might be saved. I want to read just a line from Isaiah chapter number 53. Isaiah, chapter 53. It's in verse ten. Jesus on the cross. 
<br>
28:05 It pleased God to bruise him. Jesus begged to get to go to that cross and suffer for our sins. It pleased God to it. And you'll make his soul an offering for sin. Jesus became our sin. And then Jesus will see his seed on Calvary. 
<br>
28:22 He will see the church. He will see future believers. He will see the Redeemed throne. He will see his seed. He will see his seed. And the pleasure of the Lord will prosper in his hand. I dropped a little note that I had thought about sharing with you. 
<br>
28:48 Let me be sure that you may. Want to write this down. I thought it worthy of notation. There is a wisdom that can only be gained through the crucible of suffering. And there is a wisdom that can only be gained in the crucible, the refining pot of suffering. 
<br>
29:12 Jesus had to learn not only was going to die on Calvary, not only is he going to give his blood. To forgive us of our sin, he fought for it. He begged for it. Oh, God. Oh, God. Devil tried to overthrow if Jesus had sinned in the wilderness temptation, there would have been no need for calvary. 
<br>
29:34 If Jesus had been killed if Jesus had been killed in Gethsemane, there would have been no calvary. Jesus overcame the Devil with the word of God in the first temptation, and he overcame it with prayer, their prayer. 
<br>
29:48 And the second. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you know what's going on in the lives of these Hebrew Christians, the very ones Paul's writing right now? They're suffering. Some of them are suffering, and they're wanting to quit. 
<br>
30:02 Some of them are suffering, and they're wanting to let things slip. They're wanting to backslide. They're wanting to give up. He just said, Jesus suffered. Oh, you better love him. He fought. He fought, he prayed. 
<br>
30:15 He begged to Get, to Go, to Calvary, to die for you and me. And that's why somebody would have said a newscaster of the past. And that's the rest of the story. That's the rest of the story. Why he became why he is our great high priest after the order of Melchizedek. 
<br>
30:39 I want to stand up and salute Him. I want to bow down before Him, love and adore Him. What a savior. What a savior. We have no idea. All he endured to get to the cross, and he wanted to. He desired to I'm going to have to look at my time. 
<br>
31:02 I think I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I hope I'm trying to teach you today. I hope I'm not just ministering to myself. I am worshipping my Savior in reality. Isaiah 50. Isaiah 50. Jesus getting cold feet. 
<br>
31:24 Jesus wanting to quit the foot of Calvary. No way. No way. I give my back to the smiters. Isaiah 50 is written about 700 years before our Lord is born, and yet he's already saying, I give my back to the smiters. 
<br>
31:45 The whipping at the Roman scourging, post my cheeks to them that plucked off my hair, hid not my face from their shame and their spitting. They stripped him naked. The Lord God will help me. Does that sound like somebody that's running from the cross? 
<br>
32:07 That sounds like somebody that's running to the cross to me. The Lord God will help me. I will not be confounded. I will not be and yet there in Gethsemane, as he's sweating blood, as his heart maybe only has three or four more beats and he'll be dead and not get to go to the cross. 
<br>
32:26 God will help me. God will. I'll cry out with strong tears and I set my face like a flint. I am determined. I am resigned. I set my face like a flint. Isaiah 50, verse seven. I know I'll not be confused. 
<br>
32:42 I know I'll not be ashamed. Now listen to this. Verse eight. Who will contend with me? Who's fighting, trying to keep me from Calvary? Who will contend with me? Let us stand again. That's Jesus talking to the devil. 
<br>
32:58 Who's contending with me? Who's trying to kill me in Gethsemane? Who tried to kill me as a laugh? Who's contending, trying to kill? Let us stand together. Bring it on, buddy. Come here. Let us stand together. 
<br>
33:10 Who is my adversary? Satan. Let him come near to me. Bring it on. Let him come near to me. The Lord God will help me. Who'll condemn me. I'll take him and fold him up as an old garment. I'll fold him up as a moth eaten piece of cloth and toss him aside. 
<br>
33:35 The devil lost at gethsemane. Jesus prevailed active obedience and he died on Calvary. For you and me I got to read you one more verse. I've got to quit, but I got to read you one more verse. Luke. Luke, chapter twelve. 
<br>
33:57 It's verse 50. Jesus is on his way to the cross. I mean, he is on his way to Jerusalem to die and he knows it. See if it sounds like he's scared. See if you think he got cold feet. I have a baptism to be baptized with. 
<br>
34:14 He's talking about death on the cross. I have a baptism to be baptized with. And how I am straightened till it be accomplished. Let me put that in everyday English. I'm going to have to die. I've come to die. 
<br>
34:29 I want to die. I want to do the Father's will. It's a necessity that I die. If I don't die, Mike Bagel will go to hell and every member of this class will go to hell. I have a baptism to be baptized and I can't wait till it's accomplished. 
<br>
34:45 I'm straightened till I get it done. Till I get it done. Can. I close saying hallelujah. He got it done. He got it done. My, what a savior. It's prayer time. It's prayer time. I've decided to pray. Psalm 119, verse 18. 
<br>
35:12 Listen to it. Open thou mine eyes, Lord. It's a prayer. Open thou my knives. It. That I may behold wondrous things out of thy word. Lord, would you open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of our I don't want to take the common stock interpretation on any passage of Scripture. 
<br>
35:40 It could be wrong. But I'm glad I got a God in heaven. I know him. He wrote it. He's the author and he's the interpreter of His Word. Lord, would you open our I mean, take the scales off. It's the word for to denude. 
<br>
35:58 Lord, remove any film. Help me to see 20 to open my eyes that I can gaze upon and ponder wondrous things. Wondrous things. The word there wondrous things. It's PA l a pala and it means marvelous things. 
<br>
36:22 What I've shared with you about the garden of Gethsemane today the very means that our Lord used to get to Calvary to then become our great Melchizedek High Priest. That very thing. It's wondrous. It's marvelous. 
<br>
36:39 It's overwhelming. Highest view of Jesus God. No wonder God is highly exalted. He's been given him a name that's above every name. But Paula also means hard. That's a hard thing. I'd say a quarter to a third of our class has already cut it off and left bagels. 
<br>
37:02 Wrong. I'm giving you the highest view of Jesus I know concerning the days of his flesh here on earth. All I can say is hallelujah. What a savior. Father, as we study the high priesthood hard to understand sections. 
<br>
37:21 As we study the high priesthood of Jesus. Open our eyes. Give us clear vision that we may see, ponder, behold, reflect upon. Yes, even the hard things. The meat as well as the milk. The hard things we'll have to chew a while as well as the things we can swallow whole. 
<br>
37:45 Both are good. Both our dilemma that we may behold wondrous things out of your book, your word, your law, including Hebrews. Jesus name, I pray. Amen. I got a little physically tired teaching, but God sure did help me through it. 
<br>
38:07 And I'll tell you this. I know. Brother Bagwell's heart. I sure, have tried to exalt our Savior. He's our great high priest after the order of Melchizedek. Because he lived right and because he made it through Gethsemane. 
<br>
38:26 God spared him from death in Gethsemane and he went to Calvary and he shed his blood that us old sinners might be saved.
