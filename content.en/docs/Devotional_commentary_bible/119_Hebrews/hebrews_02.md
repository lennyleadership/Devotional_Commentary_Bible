2:1 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.  
2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;  
2:3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;  
2:4 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?  
2:5 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.  

2:6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?  
2:7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:  
2:8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.  
2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.  
2:10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  

2:11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,  
2:12 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.  
2:13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.  
2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;  
2:15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  

2:16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.  
2:17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.  
2:18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.

2:1 所以我们当越发郑重所听见的道理、恐怕我们随流失去。  
2:2 那借着天使所传的话、既是确定的、凡干犯悖逆的、都受了该受的报应。  
2:3 我们若忽略这么大的救恩、怎能逃罪呢。这救恩起先是主亲自讲的、后来是听见的人给我们证实了。  
2:4 　神又按自己的旨意、用神迹奇事、和百般的异能、并圣灵的恩赐、同他们作见证。  
2:5 我们所说将来的世界、　神原没有交给天使管辖。  
 
2:6 但有人在经上某处证明说、『人算甚么、你竟顾念他、世人算甚么、你竟眷顾他。  
2:7 你叫他比天使微小一点、〔或作你叫他暂时比天使小〕赐他荣耀尊贵为冠冕、并将你手所造的都派他管理。  
2:8 叫万物都服在他的脚下。』既叫万物都服他、就没有剩下一样不服他的。只是如今我们还不见万物都服他。  
2:9 惟独见那成为比天使小一点的耶稣、〔或作惟独见耶稣暂时比天使小〕因为受死的苦、就得了尊贵荣耀为冠冕、叫他因着　神的恩、为人人尝了死味。  
2:10 原来那为万物所属、为万物所本的、要领许多的儿子进荣耀里去、使救他们的元帅、因受苦难得以完全、本是合宜的。  
 
2:11 因那使人成圣的、和那些得以成圣的、都是出于一。所以他称他们为弟兄、也不以为耻、  
2:12 说、『我要将你的名传与我的弟兄、在会中我要颂扬你。』  
2:13 又说、『我要倚赖他。』又说、『看哪、我与　神所给我的儿女。』  
2:14 儿女既同有血肉之体、他也照样亲自成了血肉之体。特要借着死、败坏那掌死权的就是魔鬼。  
2:15 并要释放那些一生因怕死而为奴仆的人。  
 
2:16 他并不救拔天使、乃是救拔亚伯拉罕的后裔。  
2:17 所以他凡事该与他的弟兄相同、为要在　神的事上、成为慈悲忠信的大祭司、为百姓的罪献上挽回祭。  
2:18 他自己既然被试探而受苦、就能搭救被试探的人。
