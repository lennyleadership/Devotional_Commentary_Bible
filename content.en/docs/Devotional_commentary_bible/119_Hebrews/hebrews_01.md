1:1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,  
1:2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;  
1:3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;  
1:4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.

1:1 　神既在古时借着众先知、多次多方的晓谕列祖、  
1:2 就在这末世、借着他儿子晓谕我们、又早已立他为承受万有的、也曾借着他创造诸世界。  
1:3 他是　神荣耀所发的光辉、是　神本体的真像、常用他权能的命令托住万有、他洗净了人的罪、就坐在高天至大者的右边。  
1:4 他所承受的名、既比天使的名更尊贵、就远超过天使。  
1:5 所有的天使、　神从来对那一个说、『你是我的儿子、我今日生你。』又指着那一个说、『我要作他的父、他要作我的子。』  
 
1:6 再者、　神使长子到世上来的时候、〔或作　神再使长子到世上来的时候〕就说、『　神的使者都要拜他。』  
1:7 论到使者、又说、『　神以风为使者、以火焰为仆役。』  
1:8 论到子却说、『　神阿、你的宝座是永永远远的、你的国权是正直的。  
1:9 你喜爱公义、恨恶罪恶。所以　神、就是你的　神、用喜乐油膏你、胜过膏你的同伴。』  
1:10 又说、『主阿、你起初立了地的根基、天也是你手所造的。  
 
1:11 天地都要灭没、你却要长存。天地都要像衣服渐渐旧了。  
1:12 你要将天地卷起来、像一件外衣、天地就都改变了。惟有你永不改变、你的年数没有穷尽。』  
1:13 所有的天使、　神从来对那一个说、『你坐在我的右边、等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。』  
1:14 天使岂不都是服役的灵、奉差遣为那将要承受救恩的人效力么。

<h1>What God Said</h1>
‪Hebrews‬1:5-12 NLT
5 For God never said to any angel what he said to Jesus:  
“You are my Son.Today I have become your Father. ”God also said,“I will be his Father,and he will be my Son.”  
6 And when he brought his supreme Son into the world, God said,  
“Let all of God’s angels worship him.”  
7 Regarding the angels, he says,  
“He sends his angels like the winds,his servants like flames of fire.”  
8 But to the Son he says,  
“Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever.You rule with a scepter of justice.  
9 You love justice and hate evil.  
Therefore, O God, your God has anointed you,pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.”  
10 He also says to the Son,  
“In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundation of the earthand made the heavens with your hands.  
11 They will perish, but you remain forever.  
They will wear out like old clothing.  
12 You will fold them up like a cloak  
and discard them like old clothing.But you are always the same;you will live forever.”
