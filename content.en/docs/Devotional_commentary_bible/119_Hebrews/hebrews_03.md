3:1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;  
3:2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.  
3:3 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.  
3:4 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.  
3:5 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;  

3:6 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.  
3:7 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,  
3:8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:  
3:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.  
3:10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.  

3:11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)  
3:12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.  
3:13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.  
3:14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;  
3:15 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.  

3:16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.  
3:17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?  
3:18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?  
3:19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

3:1 同蒙天召的圣洁弟兄阿、你们应当思想我们所认为使者、为大祭司的耶稣。  
3:2 他为那设立他的尽忠、如同摩西在　神的全家尽忠一样。  
3:3 他比摩西算是更配多得荣耀、好像建造房屋的比房屋更尊荣。  
3:4 因为房屋都必有人建造。但建造万物的就是　神。  
3:5 摩西为仆人、在　神的全家诚然尽忠、为要证明将来必传说的事。  
 
3:6 但基督为儿子、治理　神的家。我们若将可夸的盼望和胆量、坚持到底、便是他的家了。  
3:7 圣灵有话说、『你们今日若听他的话、  
3:8 就不可硬着心、像在旷野惹他发怒、试探他的时候一样。  
3:9 在那里、你们的祖宗试我探我、并且观看我的作为、有四十年之久。  
3:10 所以我厌烦那世代的人、说、他们心里常常迷糊、竟不晓得我的作为。  
 
3:11 我就在怒中起誓说、他们断不可进入我的安息。』  
3:12 弟兄们、你们要谨慎、免得你们中间、或有人存着不信的恶心、把永生　神离弃了。  
3:13 总要趁着还有今日、天天彼此相劝、免得你们中间、有人被罪迷惑、心里就刚硬了。  
3:14 我们若将起初确实的信心、坚持到底、就在基督里有分了。  
3:15 经上说、『你们今日若听他的话、就不可硬着心、像惹他发怒的日子一样。』  
 
3:16 那时听见他话惹他发怒的是谁呢。岂不是跟着摩西从埃及出来的众人么。  
3:17 　神四十年之久、又厌烦谁呢。岂不是那些犯罪尸首倒在旷野的人么。  
3:18 又向谁起誓、不容他们进入他的安息呢。岂不是向那些不信从的人么。  
3:19 这样看来、他们不能进入安息、是因为不信的缘故了。

<h1>In what ways was Moses like Jesus?</h1>
In one of Moses’ final speeches, he gave this messianic prophecy: “The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him” (Deuteronomy 18:15). The prophet whom Moses foretells bears these qualities: He will be raised up by God, He will come from among the Israelites, He will be like Moses, and He will be worthy of being heard and obeyed. The prophet who fulfills these words is Jesus Christ, the prophet like Moses.

On the banks of the Jordan River, the Jews questioned John the Baptist about who he was and why he was baptizing. Their question “Are you the Prophet?” (John 1:21) shows that they were looking for the fulfillment of Moses’ prophecy. John plainly informed them that he was not the Prophet but pointed them to the One who was: “Among you stands one you do not know. He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie” (verses 26–27). John’s description of the Messiah as one “among you” recalls Moses’ prediction that God would raise up the Prophet “from among you” in Deuteronomy 18:15. The very next day, John specifically identifies Jesus as the One they were waiting for (John 1:29–31).

In his sermon at the temple, Peter affirms that Jesus is the prophet like Moses (Acts 3:22, quoting Deuteronomy 18:15). Stephen, addressing the Sanhedrin in Acts 7:37, also quotes Moses and applies the prophecy to Jesus Christ.

Jesus is like Moses in several ways. Moses was both a prophet and a lawgiver, and Jesus is, too. Jesus was widely recognized as a prophet who spoke the Word of God (Matthew 21:46), and He gave commandments for His followers to obey (John 13:34; 15:12, 17; Galatians 6:2). Both Moses and Jesus mediated a covenant between God and men—Moses the Old Covenant (Exodus 34:27; Acts 7:44), and Jesus the New (Luke 22:20; Hebrews 9:15). Both Moses and Jesus were born during perilous times, and both narrowly escaped a king bent on murdering babies (Exodus 1:22 and Matthew 2:16–18). Both Moses and Jesus had a connection to Egypt (Exodus 2:1–4 and Matthew 2:13–14). Moses was the (adopted) son of a king (Exodus 2:10), and Jesus is the Son of the Most High (Luke 1:32). Moses spent forty years as a shepherd (Exodus 3:1), and Jesus is the Good Shepherd (John 10:11, 14). Both Moses and Jesus were known for their meekness (Numbers 12:3 and Matthew 11:29).

Moses and Jesus were alike in that they both led God’s people out of captivity. With great power, Moses led the Israelites out of physical bondage and slavery in Egypt, and Jesus, with even greater power, led God’s elect out of spiritual bondage and slavery to sin. Moses stood before Pharaoh and said, “'Let my people go” (Exodus 5:1). Jesus came “to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and . . . to set the oppressed free” (Luke 4:18). “In Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life has set you free from the law of sin and death” (Romans 8:2).

Moses was also like Jesus in that he performed miracles—not all prophets did. Several of the miracles of Moses bear a resemblance to Jesus’ miracles, most notably the provision of bread in the wilderness (Exodus 16:35), which is comparable to Jesus’ feeding of the 5,000 (John 6:1–13). In fact, after Jesus multiplied the loaves and fishes, the people’s thoughts ran immediately to Moses’ prophecy: “After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, ‘Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world’” (John 6:14).

Another way that Moses was like Jesus is that he held intimate conversations with God: “The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend” (Exodus 33:11). Jesus also had a special relationship to God: “No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son” (Matthew 11:27); “The Father knows me and I know the Father” (John 10:15). When Moses stood in God’s presence, his face shone with a heavenly glory and had to be covered with a veil (Exodus 34:29–35), and this reminds us of Jesus’ transfiguration, when “His face shone like the sun” (Matthew 17:2).

Another important way that Moses was like Jesus is that he constantly interceded for his people. When the Israelites sinned, Moses was always standing by, ready to petition God on their behalf and plead for their forgiveness. After the blatant idolatry at the foot of Mt. Sinai involving the golden calf, Moses interceded twice for the people (Exodus 32:11–13, 30–32), and his intercession was needed at other times, too (e.g., Numbers 11:2; 12:13; 21:7). Moses’ intercession was temporary, but our Lord’s is everlasting. “If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One” (1 John 2:1). Jesus is right now “at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us” (Romans 8:34). Jesus “always lives to intercede” for us (Hebrews 7:25).

Not only was Moses an intercessor for God’s people but, like Jesus, he was willing to die for them. In Exodus 32:32, Moses offers his life in exchange for sinners. “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends,” Jesus said (John 15:13), and Jesus proved His love when He “laid down his life for us” (1 John 3:16; cf. John 10:15).
