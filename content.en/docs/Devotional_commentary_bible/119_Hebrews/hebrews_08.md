8:1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;  
8:2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.  
8:3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.  
8:4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:  
8:5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.  

8:6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.  
8:7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.  
8:8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:  
8:9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.  
8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:  

8:11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.  
8:12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.  
8:13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

8:1 我们所讲的事、其中第一要紧的、就是我们有这样的大祭司、已经坐在天上至大者宝座的右边、  
8:2 在圣所、就是真帐幕里、作执事。这帐幕是主所支的、不是人所支的。  
8:3 凡大祭司都是为献礼物和祭物设立的。所以这位大祭司也必须有所献的。  
8:4 他若在地上、必不得为祭司、因为已经有照律法献礼物的祭司。  
8:5 他们供奉的事、本是天上事的形状和影像、正如摩西将要造帐幕的时候、蒙　神警戒他、说、『你要谨慎、作各样的物件、都要照着在山上指示你的样式。』  
 
8:6 如今耶稣所得的职任是更美的、正如他作更美之约的中保。这约原是凭更美之应许立的。  
8:7 那前约若没有瑕疵、就无处寻求后约了。  
8:8 所以主指责他的百姓说、〔或作所以主指前约的缺欠说〕『日子将到、我要与以色列家、和犹大家、另立新约。  
8:9 不像我拉着他们祖宗的手、领他们出埃及的时候、与他们所立的约。因为他们不恒心守我的约、我也不理他们。这是主说的。』  
8:10 主又说、『那些日子以后、我与以色列家所立的约乃是这样。我要将我的律法放在他们里面、写在他们心上、我要作他们的　神、他们要作我的子民。  
 
8:11 他们不用各人教导自己的乡邻、和自己的弟兄、说、你该认识主。因为他们从最小的到至大的、都必认识我。  
8:12 我要宽恕他们的不义、不再记念他们的罪愆。』  
8:13 既说新约。就以前约为旧了。但那渐旧渐衰的、就必快归无有了。
