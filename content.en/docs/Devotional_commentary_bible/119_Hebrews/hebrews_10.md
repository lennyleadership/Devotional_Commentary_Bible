10:1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.  
10:2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.  
10:3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.  
10:4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.  
10:5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:  

10:6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.  
10:7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.  
10:8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;  
10:9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.  
10:10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.  

10:11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:  
10:12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;  
10:13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.  
10:14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.  
10:15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,  

10:16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;  
10:17 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.  
10:18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.  
10:19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,  
10:20 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;  

10:21 And having an high priest over the house of God;  
10:22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.  
10:23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)  
10:24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:  
10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.  

10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,  
10:27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.  
10:28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:  
10:29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?  
10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.  

10:31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  
10:32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;  
10:33 Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.  
10:34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.  
10:35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.  

10:36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.  
10:37 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.  
10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  
10:39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

10:1 律法既是将来美事的影儿、不是本物的真像、总不能借着每年常献一样的祭物、叫那近前来的人得以完全。  
10:2 若不然、献祭的事岂不早已止住了么。因为礼拜的人、良心既被洁净、就不再觉得有罪了。  
10:3 但这些祭物是叫人每年想起罪来。  
10:4 因为公牛和山羊的血、断不能除罪。  
10:5 所以基督到世上来的时候、就说、『　神阿、祭物和礼物是你不愿意的、你曾给我预备了身体。  
 
10:6 燔祭和赎罪祭是你不喜欢的。  
10:7 那时我说、　神阿、我来了为要照你的旨意行。我的事在经卷上已经记载了。』  
10:8 以上说、祭物和礼物、燔祭和赎罪祭、是你不愿意的、也是你不喜欢的、（这都是按着律法献的)
10:9 后又说、我来了为要照你的旨意行。可见他是除去在先的、为要立定在后的。  
10:10 我们凭这旨意、靠耶稣基督只一次献上他的身体、就得以成圣。  
 
10:11 凡祭司天天站着事奉　神、屡次献上一样的祭物。这祭物永不能除罪。  
10:12 但基督献了一次永远的赎罪祭、就在　神的右边坐下了。  
10:13 从此等候他仇敌成了他的脚凳。  
10:14 因为他一次献祭、便叫那得以成圣的人永远完全。  
10:15 圣灵也对我们作见证。因为他既已说过、  
 
10:16 『主说、那些日子以后、我与他们所立的约乃是这样。我要将我的律法写在他们心上、又要放在他们的里面。』  
10:17 以后就说、『我不再记念他们的罪愆、和他们的过犯。』  
10:18 这些罪过既已赦免、就不用再为罪献祭了。  
10:19 弟兄们、我们既因耶稣的血、得以坦然进入至圣所、  
10:20 是借着他给我们开了一条又新又活的路从幔子经过、这幔子就是他的身体。  
 
10:21 又有一位大祭司治理　神的家。  
10:22 并我们心中天良的亏欠已经洒去、身体用清水洗净了、就当存着诚心、和充足的信心、来到　神面前。  
10:23 也要坚守我们所承认的指望、不至摇动。因为那应许我们的是信实的。  
10:24 又要彼此相顾、激发爱心、勉励行善。  
10:25 你们不可停止聚会、好像那些停止惯了的人、倒要彼此劝勉。既知道〔原文作看见〕那日子临近、就更当如此。  
 
10:26 因为我们得知真道以后、若故意犯罪、赎罪的祭就再没有了。  
10:27 惟有战惧等候审判和那烧灭众敌人的烈火。  
10:28 人干犯摩西的律法、凭两三个见证人、尚且不得怜恤而死。  
10:29 何况人践踏　神的儿子、将那使他成圣之约的血当作平常、又亵慢施恩的圣灵、你们想、他要受的刑罚该怎样加重呢。  
10:30 因为我们知道谁说、『伸冤在我、我必报应。』又说、『主要审判他的百姓。』  
 
10:31 落在永生　神的手里、真是可怕的。  
10:32 你们要追念往日、蒙了光照以后、所忍受大争战的各样苦难。  
10:33 一面被毁谤、遭患难、成了戏景、叫众人观看。一面陪伴那些受这样苦难的人。  
10:34 因为你们体恤了那些被捆锁的人、并且你们的家业被人抢去、也甘心忍受、知道自己有更美长存的家业。  
10:35 所以你们不可丢弃勇敢的心。存这样的心必得大赏赐。  
 
10:36 你们必须忍耐、使你们行完了　神的旨意、就可以得着所应许的。  
10:37 『因为还有一点点时候、那要来的就来、并不迟延。  
10:38 只是义人必因信得生、〔义人有古卷作我的义人〕他若退后、我心里就不喜欢他。』  
10:39 我们却不是退后入沉沦的那等人、乃是有信心以致灵魂得救的人。
