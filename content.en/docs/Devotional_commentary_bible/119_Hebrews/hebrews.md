Hebrews Chapter 1  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
1:1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,  
1:2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;  
1:3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;  
1:4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.  
1:5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?  

1:6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.  
1:7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.  
1:8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.  
1:9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.  
1:10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:  

1:11 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;  
1:12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.  
1:13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?  
1:14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?

Hebrews Chapter 2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
2:1 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.  
2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;  
2:3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;  
2:4 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?  
2:5 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.  

2:6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?  
2:7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:  
2:8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.  
2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.  
2:10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  

2:11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,  
2:12 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.  
2:13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.  
2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;  
2:15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  

2:16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.  
2:17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.  
2:18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.

Hebrews Chapter 3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
3:1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;  
3:2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.  
3:3 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.  
3:4 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.  
3:5 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;  

3:6 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.  
3:7 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,  
3:8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:  
3:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.  
3:10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.  

3:11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)  
3:12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.  
3:13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.  
3:14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;  
3:15 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.  

3:16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.  
3:17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?  
3:18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?  
3:19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

Hebrews Chapter 4  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
4:1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.  
4:2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.  
4:3 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.  
4:4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.  
4:5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.  

4:6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:  
4:7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.  
4:8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.  
4:9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.  
4:10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.  

4:11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.  
4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  
4:13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.  
4:14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.  
4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.  

4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.  

* ----------------------------------------
Hebrews Chapter 5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
5:1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:  
5:2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.  
5:3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.  
5:4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.  
5:5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.  

5:6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  
5:7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;  
5:8 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;  
5:9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;  
5:10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.  

5:11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.  
5:12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.  
5:13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.  
5:14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

Hebrews Chapter 6  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
6:1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,  
6:2 Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.  
6:3 And this will we do, if God permit.  
6:4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,  
6:5 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,  

6:6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.  
6:7 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:  
6:8 But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.  
6:9 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.  
6:10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.  

6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:  
6:12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  
6:13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,  
6:14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.  
6:15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.  

6:16 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.  
6:17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:  
6:18 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:  
6:19 Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;  
6:20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

Hebrews Chapter 7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28
7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;  
7:2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;  
7:3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.  
7:4 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.  
7:5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:  

7:6 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.  
7:7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.  
7:8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.  
7:9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.  
7:10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.  

7:11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?  
7:12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.  
7:13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.  
7:14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.  
7:15 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,  

7:16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.  
7:17 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  
7:18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.  
7:19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.  
7:20 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:  

7:21 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)  
7:22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.  
7:23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:  
7:24 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.  
7:25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.  

7:26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;  
7:27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.  
7:28 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.  

* ----------------------------------------
Hebrews Chapter 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
8:1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;  
8:2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.  
8:3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.  
8:4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:  
8:5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.  

8:6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.  
8:7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.  
8:8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:  
8:9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.  
8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:  

8:11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.  
8:12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.  
8:13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

Hebrews Chapter 9  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28
9:1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.  
9:2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.  
9:3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;  
9:4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;  
9:5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.  

9:6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.  
9:7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:  
9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:  
9:9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;  
9:10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.  

9:11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;  
9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.  
9:13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:  
9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?  
9:15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.  

9:16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.  
9:17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.  
9:18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.  
9:19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,  
9:20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.  

9:21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.  
9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  
9:23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  
9:24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:  
9:25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;  

9:26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.  
9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:  
9:28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.  

* ----------------------------------------
Hebrews Chapter 10  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39
10:1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.  
10:2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.  
10:3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.  
10:4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.  
10:5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:  

10:6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.  
10:7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.  
10:8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;  
10:9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.  
10:10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.  

10:11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:  
10:12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;  
10:13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.  
10:14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.  
10:15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,  

10:16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;  
10:17 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.  
10:18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.  
10:19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,  
10:20 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;  

10:21 And having an high priest over the house of God;  
10:22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.  
10:23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)  
10:24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:  
10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.  

10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,  
10:27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.  
10:28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:  
10:29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?  
10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.  

10:31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  
10:32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;  
10:33 Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.  
10:34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.  
10:35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.  

10:36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.  
10:37 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.  
10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  
10:39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

Hebrews Chapter 11  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  
11:2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.  
11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  
11:4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.  
11:5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.  

11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.  
11:7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.  
11:8 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.  
11:9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:  
11:10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  

11:11 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.  
11:12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.  
11:13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.  
11:14 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.  
11:15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.  

11:16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.  
11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,  
11:18 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:  
11:19 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.  
11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.  

11:21 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.  
11:22 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.  
11:23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.  
11:24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;  
11:25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;  

11:26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.  
11:27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.  
11:28 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.  
11:29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.  
11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.  

11:31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.  
11:32 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:  
11:33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,  
11:34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.  
11:35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:  

11:36 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:  
11:37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;  
11:38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.  
11:39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:  
11:40 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

Hebrews Chapter 12  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
12:1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,  
12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.  
12:3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.  
12:4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.  
12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:  

12:6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.  
12:7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?  
12:8 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.  
12:9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?  
12:10 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.  

12:11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.  
12:12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;  
12:13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.  
12:14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:  
12:15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;  

12:16 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.  
12:17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.  
12:18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,  
12:19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:  
12:20 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:  

12:21 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)  
12:22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,  
12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,  
12:24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.  
12:25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:  

12:26 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.  
12:27 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.  
12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:  
12:29 For our God is a consuming fire.

13:1 Let brotherly love continue.  
13:2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.  
13:3 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.  
13:4 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.  
13:5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.  

13:6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.  
13:7 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.  
13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.  
13:9 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.  
13:10 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.  

13:11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.  
13:12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.  
13:13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.  
13:14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.  
13:15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.  

13:16 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.  
13:17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.  
13:18 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.  
13:19 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.  
13:20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,  

13:21 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.  
13:22 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.  
13:23 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.  
13:24 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.  
13:25 Grace be with you all. Amen.

希伯来书 1章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

1:1 　神既在古时借着众先知、多次多方的晓谕列祖、  
1:2 就在这末世、借着他儿子晓谕我们、又早已立他为承受万有的、也曾借着他创造诸世界。  
1:3 他是　神荣耀所发的光辉、是　神本体的真像、常用他权能的命令托住万有、他洗净了人的罪、就坐在高天至大者的右边。  
1:4 他所承受的名、既比天使的名更尊贵、就远超过天使。  
1:5 所有的天使、　神从来对那一个说、『你是我的儿子、我今日生你。』又指着那一个说、『我要作他的父、他要作我的子。』  
 
1:6 再者、　神使长子到世上来的时候、〔或作　神再使长子到世上来的时候〕就说、『　神的使者都要拜他。』  
1:7 论到使者、又说、『　神以风为使者、以火焰为仆役。』  
1:8 论到子却说、『　神阿、你的宝座是永永远远的、你的国权是正直的。  
1:9 你喜爱公义、恨恶罪恶。所以　神、就是你的　神、用喜乐油膏你、胜过膏你的同伴。』  
1:10 又说、『主阿、你起初立了地的根基、天也是你手所造的。  
 
1:11 天地都要灭没、你却要长存。天地都要像衣服渐渐旧了。  
1:12 你要将天地卷起来、像一件外衣、天地就都改变了。惟有你永不改变、你的年数没有穷尽。』  
1:13 所有的天使、　神从来对那一个说、『你坐在我的右边、等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。』  
1:14 天使岂不都是服役的灵、奉差遣为那将要承受救恩的人效力么。  

* ----------------------------------------

希伯来书 2章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18

2:1 所以我们当越发郑重所听见的道理、恐怕我们随流失去。  
2:2 那借着天使所传的话、既是确定的、凡干犯悖逆的、都受了该受的报应。  
2:3 我们若忽略这么大的救恩、怎能逃罪呢。这救恩起先是主亲自讲的、后来是听见的人给我们证实了。  
2:4 　神又按自己的旨意、用神迹奇事、和百般的异能、并圣灵的恩赐、同他们作见证。  
2:5 我们所说将来的世界、　神原没有交给天使管辖。  
 
2:6 但有人在经上某处证明说、『人算甚么、你竟顾念他、世人算甚么、你竟眷顾他。  
2:7 你叫他比天使微小一点、〔或作你叫他暂时比天使小〕赐他荣耀尊贵为冠冕、并将你手所造的都派他管理。  
2:8 叫万物都服在他的脚下。』既叫万物都服他、就没有剩下一样不服他的。只是如今我们还不见万物都服他。  
2:9 惟独见那成为比天使小一点的耶稣、〔或作惟独见耶稣暂时比天使小〕因为受死的苦、就得了尊贵荣耀为冠冕、叫他因着　神的恩、为人人尝了死味。  
2:10 原来那为万物所属、为万物所本的、要领许多的儿子进荣耀里去、使救他们的元帅、因受苦难得以完全、本是合宜的。  
 
2:11 因那使人成圣的、和那些得以成圣的、都是出于一。所以他称他们为弟兄、也不以为耻、  
2:12 说、『我要将你的名传与我的弟兄、在会中我要颂扬你。』  
2:13 又说、『我要倚赖他。』又说、『看哪、我与　神所给我的儿女。』  
2:14 儿女既同有血肉之体、他也照样亲自成了血肉之体。特要借着死、败坏那掌死权的就是魔鬼。  
2:15 并要释放那些一生因怕死而为奴仆的人。  
 
2:16 他并不救拔天使、乃是救拔亚伯拉罕的后裔。  
2:17 所以他凡事该与他的弟兄相同、为要在　神的事上、成为慈悲忠信的大祭司、为百姓的罪献上挽回祭。  
2:18 他自己既然被试探而受苦、就能搭救被试探的人。  

* ----------------------------------------

希伯来书 3章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

3:1 同蒙天召的圣洁弟兄阿、你们应当思想我们所认为使者、为大祭司的耶稣。  
3:2 他为那设立他的尽忠、如同摩西在　神的全家尽忠一样。  
3:3 他比摩西算是更配多得荣耀、好像建造房屋的比房屋更尊荣。  
3:4 因为房屋都必有人建造。但建造万物的就是　神。  
3:5 摩西为仆人、在　神的全家诚然尽忠、为要证明将来必传说的事。  
 
3:6 但基督为儿子、治理　神的家。我们若将可夸的盼望和胆量、坚持到底、便是他的家了。  
3:7 圣灵有话说、『你们今日若听他的话、  
3:8 就不可硬着心、像在旷野惹他发怒、试探他的时候一样。  
3:9 在那里、你们的祖宗试我探我、并且观看我的作为、有四十年之久。  
3:10 所以我厌烦那世代的人、说、他们心里常常迷糊、竟不晓得我的作为。  
 
3:11 我就在怒中起誓说、他们断不可进入我的安息。』  
3:12 弟兄们、你们要谨慎、免得你们中间、或有人存着不信的恶心、把永生　神离弃了。  
3:13 总要趁着还有今日、天天彼此相劝、免得你们中间、有人被罪迷惑、心里就刚硬了。  
3:14 我们若将起初确实的信心、坚持到底、就在基督里有分了。  
3:15 经上说、『你们今日若听他的话、就不可硬着心、像惹他发怒的日子一样。』  
 
3:16 那时听见他话惹他发怒的是谁呢。岂不是跟着摩西从埃及出来的众人么。  
3:17 　神四十年之久、又厌烦谁呢。岂不是那些犯罪尸首倒在旷野的人么。  
3:18 又向谁起誓、不容他们进入他的安息呢。岂不是向那些不信从的人么。  
3:19 这样看来、他们不能进入安息、是因为不信的缘故了。  

* ----------------------------------------

希伯来书 4章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

4:1 我们既蒙留下有进入他安息的应许、就当畏惧、免得我们中间、〔我们原文作你们〕或有人似乎是赶不上了。  
4:2 因为有福音传给我们、像传给他们一样。只是所听见的道与他们无益、因为他们没有信心与所听见的道调和。  
4:3 但我们已经相信的人、得以进入那安息、正如　神所说、『我在怒中起誓说、他们断不可进入我的安息。』其实造物之工、从创世以来已经成全了。  
4:4 论到第七日、有一处说、『到第七日　神就歇了他一切的工。』  
4:5 又有一处说、『他们断不可进入我的安息。』  
 
4:6 既有必进安息的人、那先前听见福音的、因为不信从、不得进去。  
4:7 所以过了多年、就在大卫的书上、又限定一日、如以上所引的说、『你们今日若听他的话、就不可硬着心。』  
4:8 若是约书亚已叫他们享了安息、后来　神就不再提别的日子了。  
4:9 这样看来、必另有一安息日的安息、为　神的子民存留。  
4:10 因为那进入安息的、乃是歇了自己的工、正如　神歇了他的工一样。  
 
4:11 所以我们务必竭力进入那安息、免得有人学那不信从的样子跌倒了。  
4:12 　神的道是活泼的、是有功效的、比一切两刃的剑更快、甚至魂与灵、骨节与骨髓、都能刺入剖开、连心中的思念和主意、都能辨明。  
4:13 并且被造的、没有一样在他面前不显然的。原来万物、在那与我们有关系的主眼前、都是赤露敞开的。  
4:14 我们既然有一位已经升入高天尊荣的大祭司、就是　神的儿子耶稣、便当持定所承认的道。  
4:15 因我们的大祭司、并非不能体恤我们的软弱。他也曾凡事受过试探、与我们一样。只是他没有犯罪。  
 
4:16 所以我们只管坦然无惧的、来到施恩的宝座前、为要得怜恤、蒙恩惠作随时的帮助。  

* ----------------------------------------

希伯来书 5章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

5:1 凡从人间挑选的大祭司、是奉派替人办理属　神的事、为要献上礼物、和赎罪祭。〔或作要为罪献上礼物和祭物〕
5:2 他能体谅那愚蒙的、和失迷的人、因为他自己也是被软弱所困。  
5:3 故此他理当为百姓和自己献祭赎罪。  
5:4 这大祭司的尊荣、没有人自取、惟要蒙　神所召、像亚伦一样。  
5:5 如此、基督也不是自取荣耀作大祭司、乃是在乎向他说『你是我的儿子、我今日生你。』的那一位。  
 
5:6 就如经上又有一处说、『你是照着麦基洗德的等次永远为祭司。』  
5:7 基督在肉体的时候、既大声哀哭、流泪祷告恳求那能救他免死的主、就因他的虔诚、蒙了应允。  
5:8 他虽然为儿子、还是因所受的苦难学了顺从。  
5:9 他既得以完全、就为凡顺从他的人、成了永远得救的根源。  
5:10 并蒙　神照着麦基洗德的等次称他为大祭司。  
 
5:11 论到麦基洗德、我们有好些话、并且难以解明、因为你们听不进去。  
5:12 看你们学习的工夫、本该作师傅、谁知还得有人将　神圣言小学的开端、另教导你们。并且成了那必须吃奶、不能吃干粮的人。  
5:13 凡只能吃奶的、都不熟练仁义的道理。因为他是婴孩。  
5:14 惟独长大成人的、才能吃干粮、他们的心窍、习练得通达、就能分辨好歹了。

希伯来书 6章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

6:1 所以我们应当离开基督道理的开端、竭力进到完全的地步。不必再立根基、就如那懊悔死行、信靠　神、  
6:2 各样洗礼、按手之礼、死人复活、以及永远审判、各等教训。  
6:3 神若许我们、我们必如此行。  
6:4 论到那些已经蒙了光照、尝过天恩的滋味、又于圣灵有分、  
6:5 并尝过　神善道的滋味、觉悟来世权能的人、  
 
6:6 若是离弃道理、就不能叫他们从新懊悔了。因为他们把　神的儿子重钉十字架、明明的羞辱他。  
6:7 就如一块田地、吃过屡次下的雨水、生长菜蔬合乎耕种的人用、就从　神得福。  
6:8 若长荆棘和蒺藜、必被废弃、近于咒诅、结局就是焚烧。  
6:9 亲爱的弟兄们、我们虽是这样说、却深信你们的行为强过这些、而且近乎得救。  
6:10 因为　神并非不公义、竟忘记你们所作的工、和你们为他名所显的爱心、就是先前伺候圣徒、如今还是伺候。  
 
6:11 我们愿你们各人都显出这样的殷勤、使你们有满足的指望、一直到底。  
6:12 并且不懈怠。总要效法那些凭信心和忍耐承受应许的人。  
6:13 当初　神应许亚伯拉罕的时候、因为没有比自己更大可以指着起誓的、就指着自己起誓、说、  
6:14 『论福、我必赐大福给你。论子孙、我必叫你的子孙多起来。』  
6:15 这样、亚伯拉罕既恒久忍耐、就得了所应许的。  
 
6:16 人都是指着比自己大的起誓。并且以起誓为实据、了结各样的争论。  
6:17 照样、　神愿意为那承受应许的人、格外显明他的旨意是不更改的、就起誓为证。  
6:18 借这两件不更改的事、　神决不能说谎、好叫我们这逃往避难所、持定摆在我们前头指望的人、可以大得勉励。  
6:19 我们有这指望如同灵魂的锚、又坚固又牢靠、且通入幔内。  
6:20 作先锋的耶稣、既照着麦基洗德的等次、成了永远的大祭司、就为我们进入幔内。

7:1 这麦基洗德、就是撒冷王、又是至高　神的祭司、本是长远为祭司的。他当亚伯拉罕杀败诸王回来的时候、就迎接他、给他祝福。  
7:2 亚伯拉罕也将自己所得来的、取十分之一给他。他头一个名翻出来、就是仁义王、他又名撒冷王、就是平安王的意思。  
7:3 他无父、无母、无族谱、无生之始、无命之终、乃是与　神的儿子相似。  
7:4 你们想一想、先祖亚伯拉罕、将自己所掳来上等之物取十分之一给他、这人是何等尊贵呢。  
7:5 那得祭司职任的利未子孙、领命照例向百姓取十分之一、这百姓是自己的弟兄、虽是从亚伯拉罕身中生的、〔身原文作腰〕还是照例取十分之一。  
 
7:6 独有麦基洗德、不与他们同谱、倒收纳亚伯拉罕的十分之一、为那蒙应许的亚伯拉罕祝福。  
7:7 从来位分大的给位分小的祝福、这是驳不倒的理。  
7:8 在这里收十分之一的都是必死的人。但在那里收十分之一的、有为他作见证的说、他是活的。  
7:9 并且可说、那受十分之一的利未、也是借着亚伯拉罕纳了十分之一。  
7:10 因为麦基洗德迎接亚伯拉罕的时候、利未已经在他先祖的身中。〔身原文作腰〕
 
7:11 从前百姓在利未人祭司职任以下受律法、倘若借这职任能得完全、又何用另外兴起一位祭司、照麦基洗德的等次、不照亚伦的等次呢。  
7:12 祭司的职任既已更改、律法也必须更改。  
7:13 因为这话所指的人、本属别的支派、那支派里从来没有一人伺候祭坛。  
7:14 我们的主分明是从犹大出来的。但这支派、摩西并没有提到祭司。  
7:15 倘若照麦基洗德的样式、另外兴起一位祭司来、我的话更是显而易见的了。  
 
7:16 他成为祭司、并不是照属肉体的条例、乃是照无穷之生命的大能。〔无穷原文作不能毁坏〕
7:17 因为有给他作见证的说、『你是照着麦基洗德的等次永远为祭司。』  
7:18 先前的条例、因软弱无益、所以废掉了。  
7:19 （律法原来一无所成)就引进了更美的指望、靠这指望我们便可以进到　神面前。  
7:20 再者、耶稣为祭司、并不是不起誓立的。  
 
7:21 至于那些祭司、原不是起誓立的、只有耶稣是起誓立的。因为那立他的对他说、『主起了誓决不后悔、你是永远为祭司。』  
7:22 既是起誓立的、耶稣就作了更美之约的中保。  
7:23 那些成为祭司的、数目本来多、是因为有死阻隔不能长久。  
7:24 这位既是永远常存的、他祭司的职任、就长久不更换。  
7:25 凡靠着他进到　神面前的人、他都能拯救到底。因为他是长远活着、替他们祈求。  
 
7:26 像这样圣洁、无邪恶、无玷污、远离罪人、高过诸天的大祭司、原是与我们合宜的。  
7:27 他不像那些大祭司、每日必须先为自己的罪、后为百姓的罪献祭、因为他只一次将自己献上、就把这事成全了。  
7:28 律法本是立软弱的人为大祭司。但在律法以后起誓的话、是立儿子为大祭司、乃是成全到永远的。

希伯来书 8章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13

8:1 我们所讲的事、其中第一要紧的、就是我们有这样的大祭司、已经坐在天上至大者宝座的右边、  
8:2 在圣所、就是真帐幕里、作执事。这帐幕是主所支的、不是人所支的。  
8:3 凡大祭司都是为献礼物和祭物设立的。所以这位大祭司也必须有所献的。  
8:4 他若在地上、必不得为祭司、因为已经有照律法献礼物的祭司。  
8:5 他们供奉的事、本是天上事的形状和影像、正如摩西将要造帐幕的时候、蒙　神警戒他、说、『你要谨慎、作各样的物件、都要照着在山上指示你的样式。』  
 
8:6 如今耶稣所得的职任是更美的、正如他作更美之约的中保。这约原是凭更美之应许立的。  
8:7 那前约若没有瑕疵、就无处寻求后约了。  
8:8 所以主指责他的百姓说、〔或作所以主指前约的缺欠说〕『日子将到、我要与以色列家、和犹大家、另立新约。  
8:9 不像我拉着他们祖宗的手、领他们出埃及的时候、与他们所立的约。因为他们不恒心守我的约、我也不理他们。这是主说的。』  
8:10 主又说、『那些日子以后、我与以色列家所立的约乃是这样。我要将我的律法放在他们里面、写在他们心上、我要作他们的　神、他们要作我的子民。  
 
8:11 他们不用各人教导自己的乡邻、和自己的弟兄、说、你该认识主。因为他们从最小的到至大的、都必认识我。  
8:12 我要宽恕他们的不义、不再记念他们的罪愆。』  
8:13 既说新约。就以前约为旧了。但那渐旧渐衰的、就必快归无有了。

希伯来书 9章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28

9:1 原来前约有礼拜的条例、和属世界的圣幕。  
9:2 因为有预备的帐幕、头一层叫作圣所。里面有灯台、桌子、和陈设饼。  
9:3 第二幔子后、又有一层帐幕、叫作至圣所。  
9:4 有金香炉、〔炉或作坛〕有包金的约柜、柜里有盛吗哪的金罐、和亚伦发过芽的杖、并两块约版。  
9:5 柜上面有荣耀基路伯的影罩着施恩座。〔施恩原文作蔽罪〕这几件我现在不能一一细说。  
 
9:6 这些物件既如此预备齐了、众祭司就常进头一层帐幕、行拜　神的礼。  
9:7 至于第二层帐幕、惟有大祭司一年一次独自进去、没有不带着血、为自己和百姓的过错献上。  
9:8 圣灵用此指明、头一层帐幕仍存的时候、进入至圣所的路还未显明。  
9:9 那头一层帐幕作现今的一个表样、所献的礼物和祭物、就着良心说、都不能叫礼拜的人得以完全。  
9:10 这些事连那饮食和诸般洗濯的规矩、都不过是属肉体的条例、命定到振兴的时候为止。  
 
9:11 但现在基督已经来到、作了将来美事的大祭司、经过那更大更全备的帐幕、不是人手所造也不是属乎这世界的。  
9:12 并且不用山羊和牛犊的血、乃用自己的血、只一次进入圣所、成了永远赎罪的事。  
9:13 若山羊和公牛的血、并母牛犊的灰、洒在不洁的人身上、尚且叫人成圣、身体洁净。  
9:14 何况基督借着永远的灵、将自己无瑕无疵献给　神、他的血岂不更能洗净你们的心〔原文作良心〕除去你们的死行、使你们事奉那永生　神么。  
9:15 为此他作了新约的中保。既然受死赎了人在前约之时所犯的罪过、便叫蒙召之人得着所应许永远的产业。  
 
9:16 凡有遗命、必须等到留遗命的人死了。〔遗命原文与约字同〕
9:17 因为人死了、遗命才有效力、若留遗命的尚在、那遗命还有用处么。  
9:18 所以前约也不是不用血立的。  
9:19 因为摩西当日照着律法、将各样诫命传给众百姓、就拿朱红色绒和牛膝草、把牛犊山羊的血和水、洒在书上、又洒在众百姓身上、说、  
9:20 『这血就是　神与你们立约的凭据。』  
 
9:21 他又照样把血洒在帐幕、和各样器皿上。  
9:22 按着律法、凡物差不多都是用血洁净的、若不流血、罪就不得赦免了。  
9:23 照着天上样式作的物件、必须用这些祭物去洁净。但那天上的本物、自然当用更美的祭物去洁净。  
9:24 因为基督并不是进了人手所造的圣所、（这不过是真圣所的影像)乃是进了天堂、如今为我们显在　神面前。  
9:25 也不是多次将自己献上、像那大祭司每年带着牛羊的血进入圣所。〔牛羊的血原文作不是自己的血〕
 
9:26 如果这样、他从创世以来、就必多次受苦了。但如今在这末世显现一次、把自己献为祭、好除掉罪。  
9:27 按着定命、人人都有一死、死后且有审判。  
9:28 像这样、基督既然一次被献、担当了多人的罪、将来要向那等候他的人第二次显现、并与罪无关、乃是为拯救他们。

希伯来书 10章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39

10:1 律法既是将来美事的影儿、不是本物的真像、总不能借着每年常献一样的祭物、叫那近前来的人得以完全。  
10:2 若不然、献祭的事岂不早已止住了么。因为礼拜的人、良心既被洁净、就不再觉得有罪了。  
10:3 但这些祭物是叫人每年想起罪来。  
10:4 因为公牛和山羊的血、断不能除罪。  
10:5 所以基督到世上来的时候、就说、『　神阿、祭物和礼物是你不愿意的、你曾给我预备了身体。  
 
10:6 燔祭和赎罪祭是你不喜欢的。  
10:7 那时我说、　神阿、我来了为要照你的旨意行。我的事在经卷上已经记载了。』  
10:8 以上说、祭物和礼物、燔祭和赎罪祭、是你不愿意的、也是你不喜欢的、（这都是按着律法献的)
10:9 后又说、我来了为要照你的旨意行。可见他是除去在先的、为要立定在后的。  
10:10 我们凭这旨意、靠耶稣基督只一次献上他的身体、就得以成圣。  
 
10:11 凡祭司天天站着事奉　神、屡次献上一样的祭物。这祭物永不能除罪。  
10:12 但基督献了一次永远的赎罪祭、就在　神的右边坐下了。  
10:13 从此等候他仇敌成了他的脚凳。  
10:14 因为他一次献祭、便叫那得以成圣的人永远完全。  
10:15 圣灵也对我们作见证。因为他既已说过、  
 
10:16 『主说、那些日子以后、我与他们所立的约乃是这样。我要将我的律法写在他们心上、又要放在他们的里面。』  
10:17 以后就说、『我不再记念他们的罪愆、和他们的过犯。』  
10:18 这些罪过既已赦免、就不用再为罪献祭了。  
10:19 弟兄们、我们既因耶稣的血、得以坦然进入至圣所、  
10:20 是借着他给我们开了一条又新又活的路从幔子经过、这幔子就是他的身体。  
 
10:21 又有一位大祭司治理　神的家。  
10:22 并我们心中天良的亏欠已经洒去、身体用清水洗净了、就当存着诚心、和充足的信心、来到　神面前。  
10:23 也要坚守我们所承认的指望、不至摇动。因为那应许我们的是信实的。  
10:24 又要彼此相顾、激发爱心、勉励行善。  
10:25 你们不可停止聚会、好像那些停止惯了的人、倒要彼此劝勉。既知道〔原文作看见〕那日子临近、就更当如此。  
 
10:26 因为我们得知真道以后、若故意犯罪、赎罪的祭就再没有了。  
10:27 惟有战惧等候审判和那烧灭众敌人的烈火。  
10:28 人干犯摩西的律法、凭两三个见证人、尚且不得怜恤而死。  
10:29 何况人践踏　神的儿子、将那使他成圣之约的血当作平常、又亵慢施恩的圣灵、你们想、他要受的刑罚该怎样加重呢。  
10:30 因为我们知道谁说、『伸冤在我、我必报应。』又说、『主要审判他的百姓。』  
 
10:31 落在永生　神的手里、真是可怕的。  
10:32 你们要追念往日、蒙了光照以后、所忍受大争战的各样苦难。  
10:33 一面被毁谤、遭患难、成了戏景、叫众人观看。一面陪伴那些受这样苦难的人。  
10:34 因为你们体恤了那些被捆锁的人、并且你们的家业被人抢去、也甘心忍受、知道自己有更美长存的家业。  
10:35 所以你们不可丢弃勇敢的心。存这样的心必得大赏赐。  
 
10:36 你们必须忍耐、使你们行完了　神的旨意、就可以得着所应许的。  
10:37 『因为还有一点点时候、那要来的就来、并不迟延。  
10:38 只是义人必因信得生、〔义人有古卷作我的义人〕他若退后、我心里就不喜欢他。』  
10:39 我们却不是退后入沉沦的那等人、乃是有信心以致灵魂得救的人。

希伯来书 11章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40

11:1 信就是所望之事的实底、是未见之事的确据。  
11:2 古人在这信上得了美好的证据。  
11:3 我们因着信、就知道诸世界是借　神话造成的。这样、所看见的、并不是从显然之物造出来的。  
11:4 亚伯因着信献祭与　神、比该隐所献的更美、因此便得了称义的见证、就是　神指他礼物作的见证。他虽然死了、却因这信仍旧说话。  
11:5 以诺因着信被接去、不至于见死。人也找不着他、因为　神已经把他接去了。只是他被接去以先、已经得了　神喜悦他的明证。  
 
11:6 人非有信、就不能得　神的喜悦。因为到　神面前来的人、必须信有神，且信他赏赐那寻求他的人。  
11:7 挪亚因着信、既蒙　神指示他未见的事、动了敬畏的心、预备了一只方舟、使他全家得救。因此就定了那世代的罪、自己也承受了那从信而来的义。  
11:8 亚伯拉罕因着信、蒙召的时候、就遵命出去、往将来要得为业的地方去。出去的时候、还不知往那里去。  
11:9 他因着信、就在所应许之地作客、好像在异地居住帐棚、与那同蒙一个应许的以撒、雅各一样。  
11:10 因为他等候那座有根基的城、就是　神所经营所建造的。  
 
11:11 因着信、连撒拉自己、虽然过了生育的岁数、还能怀孕。因他以为那应许他的是可信的。  
11:12 所以从一个彷彿已死的人就生出子孙、如同天上的星那样众多、海边的沙那样无数。  
11:13 这些人都是存着信心死的、并没有得着所应许的、却从远处望见、且欢喜迎接、又承认自己在世上是客旅、是寄居的。  
11:14 说这样话的人、是表明自己要找一个家乡。  
11:15 他们若想念所离开的家乡、还有可以回去的机会。  
 
11:16 他们却羡慕一个更美的家乡、就是在天上的。所以　神被称为他们的　神、并不以为耻。因为他已经给他们预备了一座城。  
11:17 亚伯拉罕因着信、被试验的时候、就把以撒献上。这便是那欢喜领受应许的、将自己独生的儿子献上。  
11:18 论到这儿子曾有话说、『从以撒生的才要称为你的后裔。』  
11:19 他以为　神还能叫人从死里复活。他也彷彿从死中得回他的儿子来。  
11:20 以撒因着信、就指着将来的事、给雅各以扫祝福。  
 
11:21 雅各因着信、临死的时候、给约瑟的两个儿子各自祝福、扶着杖头敬拜　神。  
11:22 约瑟因着信、临终的时候、提到以色列族将来要出埃及、并为自己的骸骨留下遗命。  
11:23 摩西生下来、他的父母见他是个俊美的孩子、就因着信把他藏了三个月、并不怕王命。  
11:24 摩西因着信、长大了就不肯称为法老女儿之子。  
11:25 他宁可和　神的百姓同受苦害、也不愿暂时享受罪中之乐。  
 
11:26 他看为基督受的凌辱、比埃及的财物更宝贵。因他想望所要得的赏赐。  
11:27 他因着信、就离开埃及、不怕王怒。因为他恒心忍耐、如同看见那不能看见的主。  
11:28 他因着信、就守逾越节、〔守或作立〕行洒血的礼、免得那灭长子的临近以色列人。  
11:29 他们因着信、过红海如行干地。埃及人试着要过去、就被吞灭了。  
11:30 以色列人因着信、围绕耶利哥城七日、城墙就倒塌了。  
 
11:31 妓女喇合因着信、曾和和平平的接待探子、就不与那些不顺从的人一同灭亡。  
11:32 我又何必再说呢。若要一一细说、基甸、巴拉、参孙、耶弗他、大卫、撒母耳、和众先知的事、时候就不够了。  
11:33 他们因着信、制伏了敌国、行了公义、得了应许、堵了狮子的口。  
11:34 灭了烈火的猛势、脱了刀剑的锋刃、软弱变为刚强、争战显出勇敢、打退外邦的全军。  
11:35 有妇人得自己的死人复活、又有人忍受严刑、不肯苟且得释放、〔释放原文作赎〕为要得着更美的复活。  
 
11:36 又有人忍受戏弄、鞭打、捆锁、监禁、各等的磨炼、  
11:37 被石头打死、被锯锯死、受试探、被刀杀。披着绵羊山羊的皮各处奔跑、受穷乏、患难、苦害、  
11:38 在旷野、山岭、山洞、地穴、飘流无定。本是世界不配有的人。  
11:39 这些人都是因信得了美好的证据、却仍未得着所应许的。  
11:40 因为　神给我们预备了更美的事、叫他们若不与我们同得、就不能完全。

希伯来书 12章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29

12:1 我们既有这许多的见证人、如同云彩围着我们、就当放下各样的重担、脱去容易缠累我们的罪、存心忍耐、奔那摆在我们前头的路程、  
12:2 仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣。〔或作仰望那将真道创始成终的耶稣〕他因那摆在前面的喜乐、就轻看羞辱、忍受了十字架的苦难、便坐在　神宝座的右边。  
12:3 那忍受罪人这样顶撞的、你们要思想、免得疲倦灰心。  
12:4 你们与罪恶相争、还没有抵挡到流血的地步。  
12:5 你们又忘了那劝你们如同劝儿子的话、说、『我儿、你不可轻看主的管教、被他责备的时候、也不可灰心。  
 
12:6 因为主所爱的他必管教、又鞭打凡所收纳的儿子。』  
12:7 你们所忍受的、是　神管教你们、待你们如同待儿子。焉有儿子不被父亲管教的呢。  
12:8 管教原是众子所共受的、你们若不受管教、就是私子、不是儿子了。  
12:9 再者、我们曾有生身的父管教我们、我们尚且敬重他、何况万灵的父、我们岂不更当顺服他得生么。  
12:10 生身的父都是暂随己意管教我们。惟有万灵的父管教我们、是要我们得益处、使我们在他的圣洁上有分。  
 
12:11 凡管教的事、当时不觉得快乐、反觉得愁苦。后来却为那经练过的人、结出平安的果子、就是义。  
12:12 所以你们要把下垂的手、发酸的腿、挺起来。  
12:13 也要为自己的脚把道路修直了、使瘸子不至歪脚、反得痊癒。〔歪脚或作差路〕
12:14 你们要追求与众人和睦、并要追求圣洁。非圣洁没有人能见主。  
12:15 又要谨慎、恐怕有人失了　神的恩。恐怕有毒根生出来扰乱你们、因此叫众人沾染污秽。  
 
12:16 恐怕有淫乱的、有贪恋世俗如以扫的。他因一点食物把自己长子的名分卖了。  
12:17 后来想要承受父所祝的福、竟被弃绝、虽然号哭切求、却得不着门路、使他父亲的心意回转、这是你们知道的。  
12:18 你们原不是来到那能摸的山、此山有火焰、密云、黑暗、暴风、  
12:19 角声与说话的声音。那些听见这声音的、都求不要再向他们说话。  
12:20 因为他们当不起所命他们的话、说、『靠近这山的、即便是走兽、也要用石头打死。』  
 
12:21 所见的极其可怕、甚至摩西说、『我甚是恐惧战兢。』  
12:22 你们乃是来到锡安山、永生　神的城邑、就是天上的耶路撒冷。那里有千万的天使、  
12:23 有名录在天上诸长子之会所共聚的总会、有审判众人的　神、和被成全之义人的灵魂、  
12:24 并新约的中保耶稣、以及所洒的血。这血所说的比亚伯的血所说的更美。  
12:25 你们总要谨慎、不可弃绝那向你们说话的。因为那些弃绝在地上警戒他们的、尚且不能逃罪、何况我们违背那从天上警戒我们的呢。  
 
12:26 当时他的声音震动了地。但如今他应许说、『再一次我不单要震动地、还要震动天。』  
12:27 这再一次的话、是指明被震动的、就是受造之物、都要挪去、使那不被震动的常存。  
12:28 所以我们既得了不能震动的国、就当感恩、照　神所喜悦的、用虔诚敬畏的心事奉　神。  
12:29 因为我们的　神乃是烈火。

希伯来书 13章 《 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

13:1 你们务要常存弟兄相爱的心。  
13:2 不可忘记用爱心接待客旅。因为曾有接待客旅的、不知不觉就接待了天使。  
13:3 你们要记念被捆绑的人、好像与他们同受捆绑、也要记念遭苦害的人、想到自己也在肉身之内。  
13:4 婚姻、人人都当尊重、床也不可污秽。因为苟合行淫的人　神必要审判。  
13:5 你们存心不可贪爱钱财。要以自己所有的为足。因为主曾说、『我总不撇下你、也不丢弃你。』  
 
13:6 所以我们可以放胆说、『主是帮助我的、我必不惧怕。人能把我怎么样呢。』  
13:7 从前引导你们、传　神之道给你们的人、你们要想念他们、效法他们的信心、留心看他们为人的结局。  
13:8 耶稣基督、昨日今日一直到永远是一样的。  
13:9 你们不要被那诸般怪异的教训勾引了去。因为人心靠恩得坚固才是好的。并不是靠饮食。那在饮食上专心的、从来没有得着益处。  
13:10 我们有一祭坛、上面的祭物是那些在帐幕中供职的人不可同吃的。  
 
13:11 原来牲畜的血、被大祭司带入圣所作赎罪祭、牲畜的身子、被烧在营外。  
13:12 所以耶稣、要用自己的血叫百姓成圣、也就在城门外受苦。  
13:13 这样、我们也当出到营外就了他去、忍受他所受的凌辱。  
13:14 我们在这里本没有常存的城、乃是寻求那将来的城。  
13:15 我们应当靠着耶稣、常常以颂赞为祭、献给　神、这就是那承认主名之人嘴唇的果子。  
 
13:16 只是不可忘记行善、和捐输的事。因为这样的祭、是　神所喜悦的。  
13:17 你们要依从那些引导你们的、且要顺服。因他们为你们的灵魂时刻儆醒、好像那将来交帐的人。你们要使他们交的时候有快乐、不至忧愁。若忧愁就与你们无益了。  
13:18 请你们为我们祷告。因我们自觉良心无亏、愿意凡事按正道而行。  
13:19 我更求你们为我祷告、使我快些回到你们那里去。  
13:20 但愿赐平安的　神、就是那凭永约之血使群羊的大牧人我主耶稣、从死里复活的　神、  
 
13:21 在各样善事上、成全你们、叫你们遵行他的旨意、又借着耶稣基督在你们心里行他所喜悦的事。愿荣耀归给他、直到永永远远。阿们。  
13:22 弟兄们、我略略写信给你们、望你们听我劝勉的话。  
13:23 你们该知道我们的兄弟提摩太已经释放了。他若快来、我必同他去见你们。  
13:24 请你们问引导你们的诸位和众圣徒安。从义大利来的人也问你们安。  
13:25 愿恩惠常与你们众人同在。阿们。
