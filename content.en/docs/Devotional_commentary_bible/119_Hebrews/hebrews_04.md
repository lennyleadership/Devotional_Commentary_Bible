4:1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.  
4:2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.  
4:3 For we which have believed do <b>enter into rest</b>, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall <b>enter into my rest</b>: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.  
4:4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.  
4:5 And in this place again, If they shall <b>enter into my rest</b>.  

4:6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:  
4:7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.  
4:8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.  
4:9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.  
4:10 For he that is <b>entered into his rest</b>, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.  

4:11 Let us labour therefore to <b>enter into that rest</b>, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.  
4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  
4:13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.  
4:14 Seeing then that we have <b>a great high priest</b>, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. <a class ="marginnote">v14: 1Pt 5:4 the chief Shepherd / <b>C</b>hief Shepherd (NASV 2000)</a>  
4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.  

4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

4:1 我们既蒙留下有进入他安息的应许、就当畏惧、免得我们中间、〔我们原文作你们〕或有人似乎是赶不上了。  
4:2 因为有福音传给我们、像传给他们一样。只是所听见的道与他们无益、因为他们没有信心与所听见的道调和。  
4:3 但我们已经相信的人、得以进入那安息、正如　神所说、『我在怒中起誓说、他们断不可进入我的安息。』其实造物之工、从创世以来已经成全了。  
4:4 论到第七日、有一处说、『到第七日　神就歇了他一切的工。』  
4:5 又有一处说、『他们断不可进入我的安息。』  
 
4:6 既有必进安息的人、那先前听见福音的、因为不信从、不得进去。  
4:7 所以过了多年、就在大卫的书上、又限定一日、如以上所引的说、『你们今日若听他的话、就不可硬着心。』  
4:8 若是约书亚已叫他们享了安息、后来　神就不再提别的日子了。  
4:9 这样看来、必另有一安息日的安息、为　神的子民存留。  
4:10 因为那进入安息的、乃是歇了自己的工、正如　神歇了他的工一样。  
 
4:11 所以我们务必竭力进入那安息、免得有人学那不信从的样子跌倒了。  
4:12 　神的道是活泼的、是有功效的、比一切两刃的剑更快、甚至魂与灵、骨节与骨髓、都能刺入剖开、连心中的思念和主意、都能辨明。  
4:13 并且被造的、没有一样在他面前不显然的。原来万物、在那与我们有关系的主眼前、都是赤露敞开的。  
4:14 我们既然有一位已经升入高天尊荣的大祭司、就是　神的儿子耶稣、便当持定所承认的道。  
4:15 因我们的大祭司、并非不能体恤我们的软弱。他也曾凡事受过试探、与我们一样。只是他没有犯罪。  
 
4:16 所以我们只管坦然无惧的、来到施恩的宝座前、为要得怜恤、蒙恩惠作随时的帮助。

      <h2>Mike Badwell | Hebrews 4:9-11 ... Rest for Christian: Past, Present, and future</h2>
      <p>Let's open our Bibles to the book of Hebrews, chapter four. And in this class verses nine and ten and eleven, they are summary verses to a topic we have been discussing now for several classes, God's idea of rest. R-E-S-T rest. I need to read to you Hebrews nine and ten, and eleven. There remaineth, therefore a rest for the people of God. That's verse nine, verse ten. For he that is entered into his rest, he hath ceased from his own works as God ceased from his. Referring to the time that God created the world in six days. We saw it last night. And then God rested. Let me read verse ten again. For he that is entered into his rest. I have. If you're saved, you have. For he that is entered into his rest, he hath ceased from his own works as God did from his. And now let me read verse eleven. Let us labor, therefore, to enter into that rest, lest any man should fall, lest any man should slip, lest any man should fail. After an example of unbelief, an Old Testament example, I'll explain it of unbelief. The Jews in the wilderness who grumbled and griped and complained and fell short, did not get to enter the Land of Canaan. It almost looks at a point or two in Hebrews four, nine through eleven that there are some contradictions, but there aren't. I'll make a confession. When I first began to read Hebrews 4, 9, 10, and 11, it was hard for me to grasp. I had to find myself begging and asking the Lord to give me insight, illumination. Psalm 119 taught me to do that. Lord, would you open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law, out of Thy word. And honestly the Spirit of God, I believe, has given me some clarity on verses nine and ten and eleven. 
      <br><br>Do you remember in previous lessons we have discovered that God offers to the believer, that God gives the believer. Class. I'm talking about y'all, the believer. We've trusted him. As <b>God offers us three different rests</b>. I'm purposely sounding out that final s rests, plural. Three. There is a past tense rest, which we are now enjoying, or we should be past tense, something that happened in a previous day, a previous year with many. And then there's a rest for the future. There is a future tense rest. I am not physically, literally enjoying it, but it is on the way promised of God. There's a past tense rest, a future tense. And I suppose it's simplistic now to explain there is a present tense rest. Oh, boy. Past tense rest. That's salvation. That's salvation and that is described in verse ten we'll get to it. Future tense rest. That's heaven. That's heaven. Or the new heavens and the new Earth or the millennial Earth rest. That is future rest. It's described in verse nine. I can earn salvation. Rest. It's a gift. I cannot earn heavenly rest. The future. It is also a gift in my Father's house or many mansions. I'm going to prepare a place. If I go, I'll come again and receive you unto myself. It is a gift. But, preacher, what about that? Present tense rest? Past tense rest. Salvation. Future tense rest. Heaven glory. Present tense rest. Learning to trust Jesus in every issue of life and learning to trust Him so deeply, so dearly I have no worry, I have no fear. God is through me and because I'm trusting in his promises able to defeat the devil and to lead me not into temptation and deliver me resting in the present tense lean on my Savior leaning on the promises of God every day that I live three different rests. I think we ought to talk about them in the sequence that Hebrews 4910 and eleven presents them. That would be best. I want to take the verses and go past, present and future. But that is not the way the Holy Ghost does it. In these three verses, verse nine, let's look at it. There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. Now you got to make up your mind. You got to decide. You got to let the Holy Ghost bear witness. Now, do you belong to the people of God? Have you been saved? Are you washed in the blood? And if not, if not, you could be. Today the offer of salvation is open. Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. But if you are among the people of God, verse nine there remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God. The word that is used there for rest, it's an unusual word in verse nine. It is the word sabbatismos. Sabbatismos. It is literally the word Sabbath, the Sabbath day. Rest. There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. He's talking about heaven. He is talking about eternal life in the presence of the Lord forevermore. He's talking about glory. And after the second coming rapture and the Second Coming, when the heavens are renovated, peter says the elements will melt with the fervent and there'll be a new heaven and a new earth and a new Jerusalem. There also we will. And enjoy this rest. It is future and it is certain. It is absolutely positive. I know that. I know that I'm on my way to heaven. Can you say that first? John 513 proves it's possible. John said, I'm writing this whole epistle. These things write unto you that you may know that you have eternal life, that ye may know that if you've got eternal life, you're on your way to heaven. There is a future tense rest that remaineth, therefore, a rest for the people of God. That verb remaineth. It's apolipo. It means God has left for us. God has provided for us future rest. When I get to heaven, I hope I'll get her name in. There'll be no devil to harass me. There will be no devil to tempt me. There'll be no selfish desires and inclinations, and there'll be no lust. There'll be no world in flesh to bother me. I'll be like my savior forevermore. There is a future rest. Sometimes I think we Christians do not reflect enough on glory, on what it's going to be like over there. Rest. Rest. Hallelujah. God is the God who gives that kind of rest. Isaiah, chapter 26, verse three. God is talking about me. Keep your mind stayed upon me. It literally means, lean your mind on my word and my promises and my essence and my attributes. Lean on me and I will give you perfect peace. Perfect. Peace. I've tried to practice that throughout my life. But I'm going to a city where there will be no more sorrow, no more pain, no more death. Where there will be perfect peace. Verse nine. There remaineth, therefore, a rest for the people of God future. Rest heaven. Are you all with me so far? Now let's go to verse ten. For he that is entered into his rest he that is entered into his rest, that is an heiress verb in Greek. It's something that has already happened. It is something that has already occurred. For he that is entered into his rest hath ceased from his own works as God did from his picture bagel. What is that? That's that past tense rest I was talking about. And that was given you oh, I'm going to need an amen. That was given you the moment you got saved. The moment you were born again. Jesus said in Matthew eleven, verse number 28. Coming to me all you that labor, you're heavy laden you're worried about eternity you know you're lost on your way to hell coming to me, coming to me and will give you rest. The moment I came to him, the moment I heeded his call, the moment. I yielded to the Holy Spirit's, drawing and convicting power in my the moment I believed, the moment he infused me, flooded me with his presence. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Thou shalt be saved. God be merciful to it. The moment I try peace he gave. Me past tense peace. He gave me the peace. He gave me the peace that I now enjoy. Because I'm saved. He gave me peace with God. There is a past tense peace. And did you notice what verse ten, first ten said? He that is entered into his rest, I've entered into God's rest. He saved me and gave me that. Peace hath also ceased. From his own works I can't earn salvation. Rest I can't buy or purchase salvation. Rest. I cannot live good enough to help that. It is the gift of God. Paul says in Ephesians 289 it is. The gift of God and not of works. Lest any man should boast a class, listen to me. I'm presuming that I'm talking to a. Classroom full of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. That future rest is yours. Go to bed tonight and rest in the fact that if you die before you wake up in the morning, you will go absent from the body, present. With the Lord in a land of eternal rest. Delight in that future rest. And then when the devil comes around and the devil's trying to harass you, the devil's trying to create that, go back to where you were saved and enjoy. Past tense. Rest. I was labored heavy laden. I was in turmoil. I was on my way to hell. I was an enemy of the good Lord Jesus Christ. But I believed and he saved me. And he gave me coming to me. All you labor and heavy laden and. I will give you rest. Learn to rest in your salvation nation. As a lad, I asked Jesus to save me when I was six years old. But as a teenager, I went through a tremendous period of doubt. The devil wanted to question my salvation. The devil suggested I was too young to understand. The devil suggested I didn't pray the right words. The devil suggested that I had gotten. A hold of a counterfeit or I was in turmoil. And then one day I heard a preacher say this. He said, when the devil makes you doubt, when the devil is reaping havoc with the serenity, the peace in your soul over your salvation. Said, take the devil back to the place. Take the devil back to the time. Take the devil back to where the. Blood was applied to your heart and said when you get there and you begin to rejoice and delight in the. Fact God washed you and the blood. Of them said, the devil will take a hike. The devil will go. Resist the devil. He'll flee from you. You'll see his dust, he heads on up the road. And you will delight and enjoy in. The peace of having been washed in the blood of the Lamb. I'd take the devil back to that Sunday school class. I'd take the devil back to that morning. I'd take the devil back to the. End of my heart, into my heart. Come into my heart, Lord Jesus. I'd take the devil back to the. Infusing of the Holy Spirit when he moved in me. I'd take the devil back to the. Joy that flooded my soul. Enjoy the peace that is yours. Because you are saved. This is what happened to you when you got saved. Romans, chapter four, verse five. To him that worketh not of works. To him that worketh not believeth. You believe on Jesus. You believe on him that justifyeth the ungodly. Your faith is counted for righteousness. I don't know if y'all are doing it. I don't know how well I'm explaining this. Right now I have got a ton of peace in my heart thinking about heaven, my future hope. And I think I may have two tons of peace in my heart thinking about the fact I was saved by the grace of God. I was there when it happened. I know it. The Holy Ghost bears witness with me that I was saved, that I'm a child of God. Future peace. Past tense peace. Wow. But now neither can be earned. Both are gifts from a gracious God. But now, present tense peace. Present tense peace. You will either agree with me or disagree with me. And I'm going to love you either way. I might add, we Christians do not always have present day peace. I say we Christians. I guess Brother Bagwell better speak for himself. I may be speaking to a bunch of super giant Christians in class today. I don't know. I don't always have that rest, that peace. Sometimes I worry. Sometimes I fret. You didn't hear it here. But sometimes I grumble. Sometimes I'm ashamed of the way I do. There are times I've had thoughts that absolutely embarrass me, and I'm certainly not going to tell anybody else about them. There are times the devil talks to me and I shouldn't have listened to him. But I'm afraid I have. At times I've been discouraged and dejected. Present tense peace is different than past tense peace. It's different than first. I didn't work for that. Jesus did the work. I won't work for that. Jesus has got the mentions jesus provide Jesus the builder of the New Jerusalem. I that's peace gift. But present day peace this is going to blow your minds. You have to earn it. You have to work for it, you have to strive for it, you have to agonize for it. You have to be deliberate, you have to be diligent. Here it is, verse eleven let us labor therefore to enter into that rest. Here is a rest. All of a sudden, in verse eleven you have to labor. You have to labor in order to get, enjoy and experience this rest. That verb labor. Spudazo. Spudazo. This is what it means. Give it all you got. This is what it means. Do your very best. This is what it means. Exert all your energy, all of your mind power, all of your volition will be determined to enter into the everyday rest God has provided for us. Let us labor to enter into the everyday end of that rest. Isn't it strange? In verse number ten, talking about our salvation you have ceased from your own works. Past tense. Rest, salvation. You have ceased. No works ceased from your own work but now present day rest. The very sounds like a contradiction, but it isn't. But let us label, all of us. Paul said I got to get in on it too. Let us labor, let us work diligently. Work your fingers to the boat. Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest. Present day rest. Not past tense, that's mine. Not future tense, that's mine. Salvation in heaven, present day. Let us labor to enter into that rest. You know what that means? That means when a worry comes, I find me a promise of God and I say shoe, shoe. I shoo away that worry and I lean on my god shall supply all your needs according to his riches and glory. Here comes a temptation. I shoo that temptation away. I quote a verse about the blood of Jesus and then I say there is no temptation taken you but such as it's common demand. But God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted. But he'll make a way of escape that you can bear it. There is victory in Jesus, the world the flesh tries to over here and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. I lean on the pro. That takes labor, that takes effort. You got to memorize some Bible. You got to be on your toes. You got to be diligent in every way. Let us labor to enter into this everyday present tense rest don't work for heaven. I don't work for heaven. I don't work to get saved. But I must labor to live a life of peace, to live a life of rest day by day by day. Let me show you the difference between past tense rest and present tense rest. I think I can do it. From Matthew eleven. Past tense rest. I have already quoted it. Come unto me, all you that labor heavy laden. You're on your way to hell. You're not happy. All your life is unfulfilled. Come into me, and I will give you you. It's a gift. I will give you rest. In the very next verse, Matthew 1129 then Jesus says take my yoke upon you. That's not a gift. Take my yoke. A yoke labor tall plowing the field, living for God overcoming. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me. There's labor in learning the fellowship of his sufferings and the power of his resurrection. I'm meek and lowly, and you shall find rest. A minute ago it was given to me. I got saved. You shall find rest because I've labored, because I've been diligent. You shall find rest under your souls given. Rest given what I got say rest to be taken in my everyday life. Rest given the foot of the cross of Calvary. Rest to be found as I daily live for my Savior. Can I explain it in a little bit different way? It's almost a play on words, but I can back it up. The scripture. When you got saved, past tense rest, you got peace with God. Pete OMA. I am not an enemy of God. In fact, I'll say it without batting an eye. God is my friend. I am one of the fellows in the communion of fellowship, brother and sister in Christ, and we're fellowshipping with Jesus and God and the Holy Ghost right now. Oh, my, yes, I have peace with God. Listen to Romans five one. It happened when you got saved for being justified means born again, washed in the blood. Sins are gone, saved being justified by faith. We have peace with God. The moment I got saved, past tense, rest. I had peace with God. But peace with God is different than the peace of God. There's some of you class members, you've got peace with God. You've been saved. He's not your enemy. He's not going to send you to hell. There's heaven waiting for you, future rest. But you don't have peace in the moment. You're worrying, you're fretting, you have turmoil, you have upheaval of all kinds. You don't have the peace of God. I got to learn to trust Him, rely on Him, lean on Him. Find that rest that is available day by day by day. Here's how it's done. Here is the peace of God. Philippians four, six and seven. Listen, don't worry about anything. Try to push those worries out. How can I push those worries out? My God shall supply all my need. How can I take no thought for tomorrow? Don't worry about your clothing, don't worry about food and shelter your Heavenly Father as he feeds the birds, as he clothes the lilies of the field. He will take care of you. Oh, my. Now you begin to get a little bit of the peace of God. Don't be careful for nothing. Don't worry but in everything by prayer. Let your request be made known to God. He'll take care. And if you'll do that, don't worry. Lean on God. Pray about every day and the peace of God learn to live day by day try and the peace of God that passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and your minds be with you day by day by day through Christ Jesus that's resting momentary early in God's promises, that's victorious Spirit filled Christian living. I got that piece. I got that piece. And now I want to learn to practice and to live day by day with this peace leaning on the promises of Almighty God. Now, there's one more clause at the end of verse eleven I think we need to consider. Let's labor to enter into that rest lest any man should fall. The Lord just told us, paul just told us, the Holy Ghost just told us that if I don't learn to trust Jesus day by day, I can fall. I can fall. The verb is piptoe. It is a word that is used of a beautiful flower when it's reached its prime, its blooms. And then they wilt and boom. Fall to the ground lest ye fall. After the example of unbelief. After the same example of unbelief. What does that mean, Brother Bagwell? The example of unbelief that was left us by the children of Israel in the wilderness, who refused to trust God. Who refused to lean on the promises of God. And they ended up falling, dying in the wilderness. God forbidding them to go into the land of Canaan because it says here, verse eleven of their unbelief. That word unbelief combines the little alpha privative. It negates the meaning of a word awe and pytho. They were hard hearted. They would not be persuaded that God could keep his word. They were not willing to lean on the truth that God who brought them out of Egypt, could get them into Canaan like he promised he would do. I know some Christians today I know of, I don't know an individual I know of Christians today who though they're saved, though I believe they're going to heaven. They got that rest and they don't have everyday present day rest. They don't have it. They're not leaning on God. They're not trusted. They have not yet been persuaded. God can perform what he promised. Oh, I love those words, god can perform what he promised. God can do everything he said he was going to do, plus he can do exceeding abundantly. Above all, we can ask or think as well. MMM an old preacher I studied early this morning before recording the meditation said this after salvation, every Christian has a choice. After salvation every Christian has a choice. We can go on everyday life into Holy Ghost living. We can go on into the land of Canaan we can go on the Jews of O, into the land that flows with milk and honey. We can go on to faith rest in the resting in the promises of God. We can go on to victory. Or we can doubt, we can grumble, we can disbelieve, we cannot be persuaded by the promises of God and we can languish and die in the wilderness of dry, barren land or what a shame. What a shame. It all depends. Am I willing now that he gave me that rest and now that he's got me on the way to that rest am willing to work diligently, to believe earnestly, to practice from the bottom of my heart the promises resting on the word of God and the promises of his darling son. Somebody said it this way. You might want to write it down. Salvation is not the end. Salvation is not the end of this thing. The day you got saved, that's not the end of this thing. It's the beginning of this thing. I'm glad I got saved. I'm glad I'm under the blood. I'm still thinking and delighting in the peace that brings me. But every day I want peace. Every day. I want Victory. And salvation is a gift. This victory. You got to fight. You got to travail, you got to pray. You got to believe. You got to trust. And Paul uses the example of the Jews in the wilderness to caution us. Not to be guilty of the sins they committed. Not to grumble and gripe and complain and be bitter against God, not to disbelieve God's, I know, but there are giants in land. God can't. God can't help us win the victory. Only Joshua and Caleb said, oh, yes, God can. And only Joshua and Caleb went into the present day land of canaan, the land of rest. Listen to this verse I've got to close Deuteronomy 623. God brought us out the Jews. God brought us out of Egypt. God brought us out there that he might bring us in and give us the land of Canaan. God brought them out. That's where they got saved. The blood of the lamb was applied to the door post of their homes and the lamb was eaten internalized. They believed on Jesus, but they couldn't trust him day by day to get them into the land of. God brought them out to bring them in. But they would not let God bring them in. Recap summary deuteronomy 121. Listen. The Lord thy God has set the land before you victorious Christian living. The land of Canaan to the Jews is not heaven. It's not a picture for you and me. The land of Canaan is not a picture of heaven. Brother Bagel, how do you get that? There were giants in the land of Canaan that had to be fought. There are no giants in heaven that will have to be fought. There were enemies in the land of Canaan that had to be overcome. There are no enemies in heaven that have to be overcome. There was still the flesh to battle in the land of Canaan as we've battled, the flesh have our spirit filled. But in heaven there is no flesh. Our flesh has been glorified. It's like the body of our Lord. God wanted to bring him into the land of Canaan. Listen to the next verse. It said but you would not go up. It rebelled against the commandment of the Lord. You grumble. You murmured in your tents, I'm reading from Deuteronomy 126 and following, you said, god don't love us, god hates us. He brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us to an enemy and to kill us. Plus all these spies have come back, ten of them. They've discouraged our heart. Those people are giants over there. We can't do that. Overcome. God can't do this. And then deuteronomy one, verse 32 you did not believe a Christian can be guilty of the sin of unbelief. They believed God to save them, but they did not believe God to give them victory day by day by day. You did not believe the Lord your God, and God heard your groveling, and God heard your rebellion, and he was wroth. And he swear not one of these men of this evil generation is going to go into that good land which I swear to give to their fathers. God blocked them. And if I disbelieve, God will not give me sweet peace and victory and rest in Holy Ghost life. If I grumble and gripe and complain, I will not be filled. I will not yield the fruit of the spirit of God in my life. Paul, in one Corinthians 10:00 a.m. I going on too long, class. Paul, in one Corinthians ten looked at those Jews in the wilderness and he said, they got saved. They were born again. He said they were under the cloud, they passed through the sea. They were baptized under Moses. They ate the same spiritual meat. They ate the same that, and they followed that rock, the rock that gave water, and that rock was Christ. They had an experience with Jesus Christ, but then they doubted. They disbelieved. God was not well pleased. He overthrew them in the wilderness. And they are our examples. First corinthians ten verse six. They are our examples to the intent we should believe. We should not lust after evil things. We should trust God to lean on his promises day by day by day. They were tempted, they grumbled, they complained. Some of them were destroyed by serpents, brass fool. Incident in numbers 21 they grumbled they were destroyed by snakes and destroy. These things happen unto them. For examples they are written for our admonition upon whom the end of the age has come. And if you think you're standing, you better take heila. We could commit the same sins. They grumbling, complaining, bickering, blaming God, not believing his promises. And we would fail to enter into. Our land of Canaan, into Holy Ghost. Victorious spiritually I'll preacher. That's not for me. First corinthians ten. First to let him that think he. Standeth, take heed, lest he fall. We need to pray. God will give us peace, god will give us victory. God will give us rest in day. But we got that past rest, down, born again. We got that future. Rest assured, it's a gift. Heaven. It's an everyday rest we're going to have to claim. We're going to have to believe, we're going to have to fight, we're going to have to trust the honor and the glory of our Lord. What a three verse text? Hebrews four, nine, nine and ten and eleven. Father for the class, thank you. For the past tense rest, thank you, you saved. Does somebody raise their hand, say Hallelujah? Thank you, Lord. We're washed in the blood of the lamb we couldn't earn it. You did all the work. Jesus shed his butt. Thank you for past tense rest. Thank you for future tense rest, lord, we believe it. We believe it. I go to prepare a place. If I go, I'm coming again to receive peace. Can't earn it, can't work for it. Thank you, but oh, God I'm going to ask for rest today and tomorrow I'm going to ask rest for our weakest class member and our strongest class member. I'm going to ask rest for every lady, every gentleman, every elderly person, every grandparent, every mama and daddy, every single person, every teenager, every young person. Oh God, help us to learn, to claim help us to learn to lay hold of that daily victory of that daily rest for your honor and your glory. May we delight in our daily rest, our present rest. May we claim and achieve and fight the fight and win the battle for our everyday rest as the past tense and the future tents in Jesus name, amen. May God give you rest that's my prayer. May God give you rest today. When that doubt comes run it out of your heart run it out of your mind resting on one of the good promises be careful for nothing, don't worry but in everything by prayer and supplicant tell him what you need, don't let the devil send you worry. Tell God what you need ask and it'll be claim that promise god again I pray teach us we're all babies help us to learn to grow in the grace of trusting you every hour. Every minute of our lives. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. I hope it is in my heart's desire. The Holy Spirit has used our class today to challenge us. To challenge us to get into the battle, to fight the fight, to finish the course, to run the race and enjoy the peace, enjoy the rest God has prepared for us right now, even this very second. If you enjoyed the class, let me know. If you enjoyed our whole discussion on trust, rest and peace in the Lord Jesus. I need some input. Otherwise watched, learned. Your encouragement is a real aid, a real impetus to your preacher, to your teacher to help us stay in the Word.
