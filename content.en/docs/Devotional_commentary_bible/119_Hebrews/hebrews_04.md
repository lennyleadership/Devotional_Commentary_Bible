4:1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.  
4:2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.  
4:3 For we which have believed do <b>enter into rest</b>, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall <b>enter into my rest</b>: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.  
4:4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.  
4:5 And in this place again, If they shall <b>enter into my rest</b>.  

4:6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:  
4:7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.  
4:8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.  
4:9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.  
4:10 For he that is <b>entered into his rest</b>, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.  

4:11 Let us labour therefore to <b>enter into that rest</b>, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.  
4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  
4:13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.  
4:14 Seeing then that we have <b>a great high priest</b>, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. <a class ="marginnote">v14: 1Pt 5:4 the chief Shepherd / <b>C</b>hief Shepherd (NASV 2000)</a>  
4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.  

4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

4:1 我们既蒙留下有进入他安息的应许、就当畏惧、免得我们中间、〔我们原文作你们〕或有人似乎是赶不上了。  
4:2 因为有福音传给我们、像传给他们一样。只是所听见的道与他们无益、因为他们没有信心与所听见的道调和。  
4:3 但我们已经相信的人、得以进入那安息、正如　神所说、『我在怒中起誓说、他们断不可进入我的安息。』其实造物之工、从创世以来已经成全了。  
4:4 论到第七日、有一处说、『到第七日　神就歇了他一切的工。』  
4:5 又有一处说、『他们断不可进入我的安息。』  
 
4:6 既有必进安息的人、那先前听见福音的、因为不信从、不得进去。  
4:7 所以过了多年、就在大卫的书上、又限定一日、如以上所引的说、『你们今日若听他的话、就不可硬着心。』  
4:8 若是约书亚已叫他们享了安息、后来　神就不再提别的日子了。  
4:9 这样看来、必另有一安息日的安息、为　神的子民存留。  
4:10 因为那进入安息的、乃是歇了自己的工、正如　神歇了他的工一样。  
 
4:11 所以我们务必竭力进入那安息、免得有人学那不信从的样子跌倒了。  
4:12 　神的道是活泼的、是有功效的、比一切两刃的剑更快、甚至魂与灵、骨节与骨髓、都能刺入剖开、连心中的思念和主意、都能辨明。  
4:13 并且被造的、没有一样在他面前不显然的。原来万物、在那与我们有关系的主眼前、都是赤露敞开的。  
4:14 我们既然有一位已经升入高天尊荣的大祭司、就是　神的儿子耶稣、便当持定所承认的道。  
4:15 因我们的大祭司、并非不能体恤我们的软弱。他也曾凡事受过试探、与我们一样。只是他没有犯罪。  
 
4:16 所以我们只管坦然无惧的、来到施恩的宝座前、为要得怜恤、蒙恩惠作随时的帮助。

<br>
00:00 The following message is by Pastor John Piper. More information from Desiring God Ministries is available at www.desiringgod.org. The Lord shines very brightly in His Word, and I invite you to take your Bibles, or one from the pew in front of you and turn to Hebrews chapter four, verses twelve and 13, where the light becomes very, very penetrating, as you will see from verse twelve. 
<br>
00:36 It's on page 1423 in the pew Bible. If you're not familiar with where Hebrews is, 1423 hebrews, chapter four, verse twelve. Let's pray and ask God to make his light shine with life changing intensity. 
<br>
00:55 Into us as we begin. O Father in heaven, I ask that your Word would now come with power. It is living, it is active, it is sharper than a two edged sword. It penetrates and pierces to soul, spirit, joints, marrow, judging the thoughts and attitudes of the heart, would you cause it to have a life changing effect in every heart? 
<br>
01:38 Let none of us, I plead with you, Let none of us leave unbelieving. Make us by the power of Your Word. Believers, faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. We want to believe. Father, help our unbelief. 
<br>
02:03 Beget strong faith in your promises among Your people. Banish belief in the lies of sin and cause us to cherish the promises of God. In his name we pray our Lord Jesus Amen. Now, before I read these two verses, I want to read verse eleven and make sure that <b>we understand the connection between verses eleven, which we ended on last week. 
<br>
02:39 And verse twelve</b>. Verse eleven says, let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest. Now, <b>the rest</b> he's talking about, if you weren't here last week, is <b>the restful salvation</b> of God being forgiven, being welcomed into <b>God's fellowship, and ultimately into heaven</b> when we die. 
<br>
03:03 So be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall through, following the same example of disobedience. Now, whose example is it talking about? Who's he talking about? Remember, he's talking about the example of the Israelites in the wilderness who didn't enter the rest of God. 
<br>
03:29 They fell in the wilderness instead of entering the Promised Land, which was <b>symbolic of the ultimate rest</b> and would have been a wonderful temporal rest. But they didn't enter because of disobedience. 
<br>
03:41 But what was the essence of the disobedience? Chapter three, verse 19. So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief. Unbelief is what kept them out of the rest. <b>Unbelief is the essence of the disobedience</b>. 
<br>
04:06 In verse eleven, unbelief in what? The answer is given in verse two of chapter four. This is all review from last week. Last Sunday, chapter four. I mean, chapter four, verse two we have had good news preached to us just as they also namely the Israelites had good news preached to them, just as they also but the word they heard, that's what they didn't believe the word. 
<br>
04:39 Keep that in your mind, that phrase, the word. Because that's what's coming out in verse twelve in a minute. The word they heard did not profit them because it was not united by faith in those who heard. 
<br>
04:54 So now we've seen from 319, chapter four, verse two, chapter four, verse eleven that the Israelites heard a word. It was the Gospel according to verse two. It was promise, it was mercy, it was forgiveness, it was welcome. 
<br>
05:09 And when they heard it, they said we'd rather go back to Egypt. Thank you. We don't trust you to provide water, to provide food to beat these tall people in the promised land. We just don't believe it. 
<br>
05:23 And they fell and they did not enter the promised land. And verse eleven says to us be diligent so that that does not happen to you. Strive to enter God's heavenly rest it by being vigilant not to be unbelievers like they were, not to disbelieve the word or the promises of God. 
<br>
05:50 Now the link with verse twelve. We've got the word before us from verse two. It was that that they disbelieved it's that that constitutes the disobedience of verse eleven. Now here's the connection. Be diligent with that word so that you don't fail to enter the rest. 
<br>
06:14 For the Word of God is living and active. Now just stop there. I know if you have an NIV the word four is dropped for some inexplicable reason. That's an absolutely crucial connecting word. Here the connection is verse eleven be diligent with the Word to know it, love it, believe it, trust it, rest in it, be satisfied by it lest you become an unbeliever. 
<br>
06:45 And don't enter the rest of God. For the word of God is living and active and sharp and penetrates to the bottom of your life and reveals what's worth trusting and not trusting. Some of you are big picture people and some are little picture people. 
<br>
07:07 It starts when you're a little teeny person, eleven months old. Let me use the fancy words for big picture and little picture. By big picture I mean the synthetic people that is, who like to synthesize pieces and get a piece here and a piece there and see the big picture. 
<br>
07:24 And you don't care about a lot of details in life. You don't notice a lot of details in life. And some are the little picture people who are analytical people. You got the synthetical and the analytical and analytical people take things apart and they like to see the pieces. 
<br>
07:40 And it starts when you're little. We've got Talitha now so I'm learning these things all over again. She's eleven months old. You put this shiny new big toy in front of her with levers and bells. What does she do? 
<br>
07:53 There's a little teeny weeny chip. Missing from the paint on the right hand bar. And she looked at it like this and just spends two minutes just going like this. I said, Grab a lever, do something with it, get the big picture. 
<br>
08:14 I'm going to be interesting to watch now, if that just holds true right on through her life. But I'm preaching to people who are somewhere on that continuum between the big picture people and the little picture people, the analytic people and the synthetic people. 
<br>
08:28 And you read the Bible very differently. That's why my preaching does not appeal to everybody, because I tend to be picky. I pick words out and I pull verses apart and I say this word and this word and they fit like this. 
<br>
08:50 Now I want to say something to the big picture people just so you don't get lost. I want to say the big picture in Ephesian. What book are we on? Hebrews four. The big picture in Hebrews four has four stages. 
<br>
09:04 So here it is, you big picture people who get lost when I talk about four and because, and therefore and how it all hangs together. Here's the big picture. Stage one. The aim of life in this chapter is to enter the rest of God. 
<br>
09:20 That is, heaven, forgiveness, acceptance, love, joy with him forever. That's stage one. Stage two is the indispensable means of entering, namely, faith, believing, trusting, being satisfied with all that God is for you in Jesus. 
<br>
09:46 Stage three is the indispensable means of believing, namely the word of God. We've got to have promises. We've got to have God speaking to us about what he intends to do for us in order to trust Him so that we enter his rest. 
<br>
10:03 Chapter three, verse 19 says they entered because of belief or they didn't enter because of unbelief. And chapter I forget what chapter it is says we entered through faith. What verse now? Level four, or stage four, you got heaven or rest. 
<br>
10:21 You've got faith, trust, belief. And then you've got the word of God. And now the last bottom stage here is in verse eleven of chapter four. Diligence in the use of the means of the Word of God so that you don't fail to appropriate the Word and have the faith and enter the rest. 
<br>
10:47 The Christian life is a life of vigilant use of the Bible to stay believing in the promises of God. And that's what's on the front burner of this book. We'll see it again and again. Chapter two, chapter three, chapter four. 
<br>
11:05 Be diligent, take heed, listen, exhort one another and so on. Now we come here to verse eleven and that's the level that we're at. We're at the level four of Diligent use of the Word of God so that we don't make shipwreck and fail to enter the rest that he holds out. 
<br>
11:29 And verse twelve is given as a reason back to the analytical level. A reason, an argument, a ground. Let me just a lot of college students in this room here. Now, the college students have their class in the first hour. 
<br>
11:48 If you're a college student here and you didn't go to that class called Toshavim Philemon, Stand Up philemon is the leader of that class. Thank you. Now you can sit down. You all know Philammon here. 
<br>
11:58 Philammon is the leader of Toshavim group and if you didn't come to the first hour, you're all welcome to come to the first hour. Now, the reason I draw attention to college students is because nobody told me at Wheaton College. 
<br>
12:09 And I didn't learn it until I went to seminary and had one teacher who's the only teacher who said it is obvious is that for some reason, for about 223 years of my life, I saw Bible statements as strings of pearls. 
<br>
12:31 And you take a pearl and you admire it and you make use of it and put back take another pearl. And nobody until 1968, in the fall, in a Hermeneutics class with Dan Fuller, told me they're not strings of pearls, they're links in a chain. 
<br>
12:49 And they're connected by therefores becauses in order thats all those because apostles argue, they give extended lines of reasoning. And when I saw that, my whole world changed. Close parentheses. Verse twelve begins with because even though the NIV doesn't care about what I care about, it's there in the NASV, the RSV, the King James Version, and the Greek, which is what counts. 
<br>
13:32 And it's because now, this is important. It because verse eleven is the main. Point of this whole book. Be vigilant in living the Christian life lest you fall short of heaven. For here's your argument, here's your reason, here's your foundation, here's your ground, here's the way to get there. 
<br>
13:51 Here's the means of fighting, here's the way to win for. The word of God is sharp. It's living, it's active. It pierces to the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 
<br>
14:13 Now, this is a classic verse to frustrate a preacher because every word in it demands a sermon. I mean, aren't you sitting there right now wondering, soul and spirit, what's the difference between a soul and a spirit? 
<br>
14:34 Aren't you wondering, what in the world do joints and bone marrow have to do with the word of God? Aren't you wondering, does the pair, living and active, maybe relate to the pair soul and spirit, joints and marrow? 
<br>
14:57 Aren't you wondering as you get to the end of the earth heart, oh, another piece of my body. What does heart have to do with soul and spirit and joints and marrow? And I'm not going to talk about any of that. 
<br>
15:12 Isn't that frustrating to you? It frustrates me because I would have to preach for about 16 years on this book to preach that way, to take every piece like that. So I leave that for you to contemplate. 
<br>
15:30 And here's what I'm going to do with this verse. We've got a little forest here and a lot of trees, and I don't want to get lost among the trees and miss the glory of the forest. Let me try to state the beauty of the forest in one sentence. 
<br>
15:48 And here's the sentence. See if you would agree. The word of God. Penetrates very, very deep. That covers about six of those words, just very, very deep. Like a sword through tough, hard layers. I'll talk in a minute about what I think those layers might be it. 
<br>
16:20 And when it gets down there to wherever it's going at the bottom, it starts judging thoughts and intentions. That's my interpretation of verse twelve. But let me try to fill it out. Take the word judging. 
<br>
16:42 I use baseball cards in the first hour because there are a lot of kids in that service. I use a car in this hour. If you are trying to buy a car and you drive your car to a mechanic and you drive the car in and you say, what's your judgment on this car? 
<br>
16:58 You don't mean what's your condemnation? Judgment is not just condemnation. When you hear the word judging, you see the word judging there to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. For years I read this verse as condemnation. 
<br>
17:17 I read this verse as mainly threat, not encouragement. I'm going to try to redo that for myself this morning and maybe for you. Judging is a two pronged activity, right? What's your judgment of this car? 
<br>
17:32 And he says, well, good tires s, good brakes don't hear any clicks, transmission not so good. And his judgment proceeds on what's good and what's bad in the car. I believe the word of God. When it gets to the bottom of the layers. 
<br>
17:52 Having penetrated through all the stuff that we try to hide with, it starts. Saying what's good and what's bad down there. But that's not quite right. It's not quite right because the issue. Isn'T just what's good and bad in me, the issue in this chapter is. 
<br>
18:15 What'S believing and unbelieving in me. What John Piper needs help with is more specific than Word of God. Show me my badness and my goodness. That's not the way. I don't think the Bible wants us to quite think like that. 
<br>
18:32 It's enough badness to just make me feel awful. And there's not any goodness except what God puts there. So that's not quite the issue. The issue is when the Word gets to the bottom, does it find a believer? 
<br>
18:51 Does it find faith in the promises of God? Does it find a cleaving to mercy? Does it find somebody who's leaning hard on the promises to take care of me? Or does it find somebody who's beginning. To trust in compromise and expediency and the lies of sin? 
<br>
19:13 The issue at the bottom where the Word of God goes is faith. Does the word of God find faith? And the way it exposes whether there's faith there is with promises. That's why I spent five minutes at the beginning of this sermon linking this verse with verse two of chapter four. 
<br>
19:32 Because in verse two of chapter four it says we have had the Gospel preached to us, the good news preached to us just as they did. But the Word did not profit them because it did not meet with faith. 
<br>
19:45 The Word is the same Word as in chapter twelve. And so the Word is good news, not condemning news, it's good news. So the gospel, good news, promises mercy, forgiveness, goes down there into the bottom of my heart and starts shining its bright light all over the place. 
<br>
20:01 And you know what's? Exposed, unbelief, when a beautiful, all satisfying promise of God stares me in the face at the bottom of my life and I am turned from it, loving and trusting something sinful. I am helped and delivered. 
<br>
20:23 This is an encouraging delivering word. Let me give you an illustration from this week. This week I had to do one of those things that is not a favorite part of my ministry as a pastor. I had to make about three phone calls, all of which were very painful. 
<br>
20:42 They were painful because they all involved disagreement and conflict. I don't like to make phone calls like that. It feels every time like it's a no win situation. I could either compromise a principle or a truth or a conviction that I and the staff have and trust that, or I could stand with the principle and the truth and the conviction and almost know for certain I'm going to be misunderstood and disapproved. 
<br>
21:22 And when you have to make phone calls like that, you just stare at the phone and ask for Jesus to come back. It now you know what the most important thing in that moment is? The most important thing at that moment is, do I trust God? 
<br>
21:47 Do I trust the promises of God instead of. Trusting wording twists, or trusting timing, or trusting expedient compromise, or trusting a half truth and leaving out a little bit. Do I trust that. Or do I trust God and his promises? 
<br>
22:09 I'll help you. I'll strengthen you. I'll hold you up. I'll work for you. I'll pursue you with goodness and mercy. It that's the issue. So if that's the issue, if faith is the issue, what do I do? There's a battle going on. 
<br>
22:26 There's a battle going on in you this week. You are all facing some stuff which you might trust promises of God about, or you might start trusting yourself or some compromising way about. What do you do? 
<br>
22:40 I'll tell you what I did. It's real simple, nothing new. Number one, you marinate your mind in the Bible so that it starts to smell like Bible. When you open your mouth and speak, it smells like, whoo that's Bible breath. 
<br>
23:01 That's good. That's number one. You soak in the Bible. Number two, you email all your small group members. Now, not every small group is wired up yet, but that's coming. Everybody be on email in the world soon. 
<br>
23:25 We're all on email. So I emailed Tom. Stellar. David, Michael and Sally. Brad Nelson, Chuck Morris. Tom Stellar. Let's say that five of them, I think. I emailed them all, and I told them my situation. 
<br>
23:42 I told them the conflict, I told them my struggle, and I asked him for counsel, and I said I got to have it by Thursday. Morning. So there they were, four answers on Thursday morning, and I read them carefully. 
<br>
24:02 Irv. He sent one, tom sent one, david Michael sent one. David living is out of town. There they were. I read them and I got help from these word rooted words of counsel. Talk to Noelle as we took our little walk down on what's the name of that island? 
<br>
24:20 Pikes island down at the Fort Snelling Preserve. That's where we took our day off walk this week. And we talked about this issue and we prayed. So I marinated my mind, I emailed my small group and I talked to my wife and then I got on the phone on Friday morning and made the call. 
<br>
24:44 And God, I think, helped and there was warmth, I think, and we'll see how it goes. What I'm illustrating here is chapter three, verses twelve and 13, as well as chapter four, verse twelve. Let your eyes run up the page a minute. 
<br>
25:03 Chapter three, verse twelve. Take care, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart. That's my fear, folks. I fear unbelief. I fear unbelief more than anything in the world. I don't want to be an unbeliever. 
<br>
25:18 I don't want to make a phone call and find myself trusting in lies. I want to trust in God. I want to be a believer and not fall away from the living God. Verse 13. Encourage one another, day after day. 
<br>
25:33 That's why I emailed my brothers in my group. I need daily encouragement, guidance. So do you. That's why you need to be in a small group or have some kind of connectedness with people who care enough about you that they're in your face asking how you're doing with your work and whether you're. 
<br>
25:51 Trusting in sin or trusting in God. As long as it is called today. Lest there be in any of you. Lest any one of you be hardened. Now, here comes a very crucial phrase by the deceitfulness of sin. Mark that the deceitfulness of sin. 
<br>
26:14 Would you agree that the only reason you sin is because you believe at that moment the lie of the sin, that things will go better this way? Or at least the charge of the moment will be worth the misery of the consequences? 
<br>
26:40 That's the lie of Satan. Now, I said Satan and caught myself in the first hour and corrected it to sin. And a woman came up to me afterwards, she said, why'd you correct yourself? The reason I'm correcting myself now as well as then, when I said lie of no, no, not just get Satan. 
<br>
27:00 Out of this sermon. He's not in this sermon. Sin is in this sermon. The lie of sin. It says. Do you see the phrase the markets. Not my phrase, at the end of verse 13 in chapter three, the deceitfulness of sin. 
<br>
27:14 Sin lies. Satan's a liar, sure, but we talk way too much about the lies of Satan. You got enough sin in you rooted deep in your own heart to keep you deceived the rest of your life. If Satan falls down dead. 
<br>
27:30 You satan's. Not the big problem in this world. I'm the big problem in this world. John Piper's Carnality is the big problem in my marriage and my parenting and my pastoring and my citizenship and everything else. 
<br>
27:44 Where I cause trouble, I'm the problem. Satan doesn't get the credit for that. All he can do is come in. And give boosters to my sin. I get that from Ephesians two, two and three. Study that later. I'm the problem when I get deceived. 
<br>
28:03 My sin is deceiving me. Sin is rooted in me according to. Chapter six and seven in Romans. It's like a power in me. And Paul cries out, oh, this sin rooted in me. Satan's not even mentioned in chapters Romans. 
<br>
28:19 Six, seven and eight. So that's why I corrected myself and said the issue here when I got. On the telephone, or as I struggled. With the phone and as you're struggling today and this week with whether you're. 
<br>
28:32 Going to trust God's promises or trust. Expediency and sin, the issue there is. Do you get deceived by the lies of sin? Sin says to you, for example, the. Only way you'll have any future is if you get an abortion. 
<br>
28:49 That's one of them. Or it says to you, the only way you're going to have any future is if you cheat on this test. You won't make it through school if you don't cheat. That's a promise. That's a promise. 
<br>
29:04 Sin only has power through promises. Or it might say, you won't attract him if you don't dress provocatively. You don't need Satan to tell you that. Sin will just tell you that. Or you will lose him or her if you don't compromise your sexual standards and you feel so fulfilled and accepted and loved when you're around him or her, that's the lie that Satan is promising. 
<br>
29:42 Or Satan. Sin says, you won't have any job security. If you speak out about the dishonest practices at your office or it says your only hope for future is to get out of this marriage relationship because it is one hell. 
<br>
30:09 Or it says if you go on looking weak like you do and getting stepped on and don't take some kind of revenge, your life is going to be miserable. The only reason any of you sins is because you believe those promises. 
<br>
30:27 It's the only reason I sin. In the moment when sin offers its little tricky half truth, you will be like God. You believe it. And in believing it, you stop believing in the promises of God. And that's what's at stake every day in the Christian life. 
<br>
30:46 And that's why this book of Hebrews was written, to make us vigilant over unbelief, so that we'll trust in the promises of God and not believe in what verse 13 of chapter three calls the deceitfulness of sin. 
<br>
31:01 And here's the problem, one of the deep problems sometimes those lies got into you when you were small or a teenager or 20 years old or 40, and the deceptions of sin began to layer themselves over, creating a pocket of almost impenetrable conviction that this must be so. 
<br>
31:29 It I really can't be happy unless and let's sin fill in the blank. Let sin fill in the blank. And the layers are so thick that if somebody comes along and says, you know, that's wrong, that's harmful to you, it's. 
<br>
31:49 What do you mean? It's my only hope of happiness. How could it be harmful to me? And there is no touching it. It is so deep and so powerfully rooted beneath all the layers of deception that sin has used. 
<br>
32:05 That's why verse twelve is in this book to give you an encouragement that as you struggle and are diligent with the deceit of the promises of sin, you will know that the promises of God are powerful. 
<br>
32:24 The word of God is living and active, sharper than a two edged sword. It penetrates down to that division of soul and spirit and joints and marrow. And it gets beneath all those layers of deception. And when it gets there, it starts. 
<br>
32:47 Assessing with promises, superior promises. At the bottom of all the layers is not, you dirty, lousy, no good sinner. Which is, of course, true, but that doesn't rescue us. What rescues us is look. I am a god, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love, keeping faith with thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression. 
<br>
33:19 And sin, my son, has died for sinners. All sin can be removed. I hold out promises to pursue you with goodness and mercy all your days and bring you into a rest that will satisfy your heart forever and ever. 
<br>
33:33 That's what the word, the light of verse two of chapter four sheds down there. And what it does is suddenly it causes the half truths of sin to be exposed for the lies that they are. And it's freedom when the Word of God gets in there like that the picture I had in my mind and I totally blew it in the first hour because I don't know anything about rocks and wood, but I get it right this time. 
<br>
34:00 The picture I had in my mind yesterday, even though the terminology is wrong the reality of it's, okay, is that there's at the bottom of our lives tucked away for most of us, some darkness. And in the darkness, a little bit of a flicker. 
<br>
34:16 We can still see these little black I call them stones in the first hour because I thought ebony was a stone. And now somebody tells me it's wood, okay? There's these little piece of ebony. Hard, pretty, shiny. 
<br>
34:31 The kind of thing you'd put on a necklace, hang around your neck and you pick up this little piece of ebony and you look at it. Oh, this is valuable. I want to live for this. I will put this in my pocket. 
<br>
34:41 And then suddenly, the Word of God all the layers come off, the windows fly open, and the light streams in. And what you got in your hand a roach. It's a roach. That's the way the Word of God works. As long as the layers are there, the little tentacles, the little fuzzy parts of the roach just folds himself in and just a shiny back. 
<br>
35:12 I said stone in the first hour, okay? Shiny, hard, piece of wood. Got it. But it's valuable. It's the kind of thing you put on a neck and it shows its shiny side to you. Sin, pick me up. Feel me. I feel good. 
<br>
35:29 That's why sin talks. Steal, lie, adultery. Lust, pride, half truths. Pick me up. I'm good. I'm valuable. Life becomes better when you do it like this. Pizza Hut yesterday watching my 20 minutes of TV a week. 
<br>
35:57 And Vince Lombardi is on there walking into the sunset with his football and saying there's more to life than football, but not much. I said to Barnabas, that's a lie. It's another lie. Football is a little teeny weeny weeny part of life, not almost the whole thing or you're sick. 
<br>
36:28 The TV is filled with half truths putting the shiny side of the roach to you so that in the darkness of deception it'll feel like a piece of ebony and you'll pick it up and you'll build your life on it. 
<br>
36:39 And the only hope for us is verse twelve of chapter four, right through. And there it is opening up. The light is shining. This is not condemnation. This is gospel shining on those roaches. I mean, would you not if your house were dark and you were going around picking up little roaches and put them in your pocket because you thought they were valuable piece of ebony, would you not want somebody to open the window? 
<br>
37:04 I think you would. And then you would do what's called? Anybody know the religious word for this? What's the religious word for that? Guess. It's repentance. Repentance. So now I'm done. This is the end of the sermon and we're at a crisis point. 
<br>
37:26 Now, I haven't said a word about verse 13, chapter four, verse 13. Just no time. But here's the point of verse 13. The point of verse 13 is to say, folks, there's a crisis right now. In the next two minutes as we close, there's a crisis. 
<br>
37:44 And the crisis is this. The word of God as imperfectly as I have done. It has been preached this morning. It has penetrated for some of you to a new level. And some stuff has been laid open that's coming this week or came last week. 
<br>
38:07 Something now looks like a roach more than it did when you walked in to this room. And verse 13 says, you are right now naked before God. You are open and laid bare. He knows exactly what your conscience is telling you right now about what's been happening. 
<br>
38:34 He sees it all. You can't hide anything in your heart or mind from Him. In fact, he knows far more than you do about it. And that creates a crisis because what the Lord is saying to you right now is all right. 
<br>
38:47 I have penetrated through John Piper's exposition of my word a little deeper and I've shown you some things. What are you going to do? I'm watching and I see everything. And I want you to do two things. 
<br>
39:04 Very simple. One, turn away from the lies and the promises of sin. Recognize them for the roaches that they are and turn toward the promises of God. We got religious lingo for this, but I don't I don't want it to be worn out in your ears. 
<br>
39:31 This is called repentance. Get out of my life, you roaches. I'm sick of it. Get out of my life. I hate you. You renounce sin. You become an enemy of sin. You declare war on sin, and then you turn to this light streaming through the window which says, oh, it's so much better. 
<br>
39:56 Blessed are the pure in heart. They're going to see God. And you embrace the promise and you feed on it. And that's faith. Let's pray. Father, I pray that you give repentance and that you'd give faith by the power of your revealing word of promise. 
<br>
40:21 I thank you for the gospel that there's forgiveness for roach loving. I thank you for the promise that there's cleansing from all the leavings that these roaches have messed us up with. And I thank you that there's a future with you both in this life and in the life to come that is whole. 
<br>
40:47 It will always be a battle. That's what this whole book of Hebrews is about a battle to keep on believing, trusting. So would you draw people out of trusting promises of sin and into trusting promises of God. 
<br>
41:10 Now unto Him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before the throne of his glory with rejoicing and without any blemish at all through Jesus Christ our Lord. To Him be glory before all time, now and forever and ever. 
<br>

      <h2><b>Mike Badwell</b> | Hebrews 4:9-11 ... Rest for Christian: Past, Present, and future</h2>
      <p>Let's open our Bibles to the book of Hebrews, chapter four. And in this class verses nine and ten and eleven, they are summary verses to a topic we have been discussing now for several classes, God's idea of rest. R-E-S-T rest. I need to read to you Hebrews nine and ten, and eleven. There remaineth, therefore a rest for the people of God. That's verse nine, verse ten. For he that is entered into his rest, he hath ceased from his own works as God ceased from his. Referring to the time that God created the world in six days. We saw it last night. And then God rested. Let me read verse ten again. For he that is entered into his rest. I have. If you're saved, you have. For he that is entered into his rest, he hath ceased from his own works as God did from his. And now let me read verse eleven. Let us labor, therefore, to enter into that rest, lest any man should fall, lest any man should slip, lest any man should fail. After an example of unbelief, an Old Testament example, I'll explain it of unbelief. The Jews in the wilderness who grumbled and griped and complained and fell short, did not get to enter the Land of Canaan. It almost looks at a point or two in Hebrews four, nine through eleven that there are some contradictions, but there aren't. I'll make a confession. When I first began to read Hebrews 4, 9, 10, and 11, it was hard for me to grasp. I had to find myself begging and asking the Lord to give me insight, illumination. Psalm 119 taught me to do that. Lord, would you open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law, out of Thy word. And honestly the Spirit of God, I believe, has given me some clarity on verses nine and ten and eleven. 
      <br><br>Do you remember in previous lessons we have discovered that God offers to the believer, that God gives the believer. Class. I'm talking about y'all, the believer. We've trusted him. As <b>God offers us three different rests</b>. I'm purposely sounding out that final s rests, plural. Three. There is a past tense rest, which we are now enjoying, or we should be, past tense, something that happened in a previous day, a previous year with many. And then there's a rest for the future. There is a future tense rest. I am not physically, literally enjoying it, but it is on the way, promise of God. There's a past tense rest, a future tense rest, and I suppose it's simplistic now to explain there is a present tense rest. Oh, boy. <b>Past tense rest. That's salvation</b>. That's salvation and that is described in verse ten we'll get to it. <b>Future tense rest. That's heaven. That's heaven. Or the new heavens and the new Earth or the millennial rest</b>. That is future rest. It's described in verse nine. I can't earn salvation. Rest. It's a gift. I cannot earn heavenly rest. The future. It is also a gift in my Father's house or many mansions. I'm going to prepare a place. If I go, I'll come again and receive you unto myself. It is a gift. But, preacher, what about that? Present tense rest? Past tense rest. Salvation. Future tense rest. Heaven glory. <b>Present tense rest. Learning to trust Jesus in every issue of life and learning to trust Him so deeply, so dearly I have no worry, I have no fear</b>. God is through me and because I'm trusting in his promises able to defeat the devil and to lead me not into temptation and <b>deliver me resting</b> in the present tense leaning on my Savior leaning on the promises of God every day that <b>I live three different rests</b>. 
      <br><br>I think we ought to talk about them in the sequence that Hebrews 4,9,10, and 11 presents them. That would be best. I want to take the verses and go past, present and future. But that is not the way the Holy Ghost does it in these three verses. Verse nine, let's look at it. There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. Now you got to make up your mind. You got to decide. You got to let the Holy Ghost bear witness. Now, do you belong to the people of God? Have you been saved? Are you washed in the blood? And if not, if not, you could be today. The offer of salvation is open. Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. But if you are among the people of God, verse nine, there remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God. The word that is used there for rest, it's an unusual word in verse nine. It is the word sabbatismos. <u class = "red">Sabbatismos</u>. It is literally the word Sabbath, <b>the Sabbath day Rest</b>. There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. He's talking about heaven. He is talking about eternal life in the presence of the Lord forevermore. He's talking about glory. And after the second coming - rapture, and the second coming, when the heavens are renovated, Peter says the elements will melt with the fervent and there'll be a new heaven and a new earth and a new Jerusalem. There also we will enjoy this rest. It is future and it is certain. It is absolutely positive. I know that I know that I'm on my way to heaven. Can you say that? 1 John 5:13 proves it's possible. John said, I'm writing this whole epistle. These things write unto you that you may know that you have eternal life, that ye may know that if you've got eternal life, you're on your way to heaven. There is a future tense rest that remaineth, therefore, a rest for the people of God. That verb remaineth. It's <u class = "red">apolipo</u>. It means God has left for us. God has provided for us future rest. When I get to heaven, I hope I'll get her name in. There'll be no devil to harass me. There will be no devil to tempt me. There'll be no selfish desires and inclinations, and there'll be no lust. There'll be no world in flesh to bother me. I'll be like my savior forevermore. There is a future rest. Sometimes I think we Christians do not reflect enough on glory, on what it's going to be like over there. Rest. Rest. Hallelujah. God is the God who gives that kind of rest. Isaiah, chapter 26, verse three. God is talking, think about me, keep your mind stayed upon me. It literally means, lean your mind on my word and my promises and my essence and my attributes. Lean on me and I will give you perfect peace. perfect peace. I've tried to practice that throughout my life. But I'm going to a city where there will be no more sorrow, no more pain, no more death. Where there will be perfect peace. Verse nine. There remaineth, therefore, a rest for the people of God. future rest, heaven's. 
      <br><br>Are you all with me so far? Now let's go to verse ten. For he that is entered into his rest, he that is entered into his rest, that is <u>an heiress verb in Greek</u>. It's something that has already happened. It is something that has already occurred. For he that is entered into his rest hath ceased from his own works as God did from (his picture bagel ?). What is that? That's that past tense rest I was talking about. And that was given you oh, I'm going to need an amen. That was given you the moment you got saved. The moment you were born again. Jesus said in Matthew 11, verse number 28. Coming to me all you that labor, you're heavy laden you're worried about eternity, you know you're lost on your way to hell, coming to me, coming to me and I will give you rest. The moment I came to him, the moment I heeded his call, the moment. I yielded to the Holy Spirit's, drawing and convicting power in my the moment I believed, the moment <u>he infused me, flooded me with his presence</u>. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Thou shalt be saved. God be merciful to it. The moment I try peace he gave me <b>past tense peace</b>. He gave me the peace. He gave me the peace that I now enjoy. Because I'm saved. He gave me peace with God. There is a past tense peace. And did you notice what verse ten, verse ten said, He that is entered into his rest, I've entered into God's rest. He saved me and gave me that peace, hath also ceased. From his own works I can't earn salvation. Rest I can't buy or purchase salvation rest, I cannot live good enough to help that. It is the gift of God. Paul says in Ephesians 2:8-9, it is the gift of God and not of works. Lest any man should boast. 
      <br><br>A class, listen to me. I'm presuming that I'm talking to a Classroom full of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. That future rest is yours. Go to bed tonight and rest in the fact that if you die before you wake up in the morning, you will go absent from the body, present with the Lord in a land of eternal rest. Delight in that future rest. And then when the devil comes around and the devil's trying to harass you, the devil's trying to create that, go back to where you were saved and enjoy that past tense rest. I was labored, heavy laden. I was in turmoil. I was on my way to hell. I was an enemy of the good Lord Jesus Christ. But I believed and he saved me. And he gave me coming to me. All you labor and heavy laden and. I will give you rest. Learn to rest in your salvation nation. As a lad, I asked Jesus to save me when I was six years old. But as a teenager, I went through a tremendous period of doubt. The devil wanted to question my salvation. The devil suggested I was too young to understand. The devil suggested I didn't pray the right words. The devil suggested that I had gotten a hold of a counterfeit or I was in turmoil. And then one day I heard a preacher say this. He said, when the devil makes you doubt, when the devil is reaping havoc(?) with the serenity, the peace in your soul over your salvation. Said, take the devil back to the place. Take the devil back to the time. Take the devil back to where the blood was applied to your heart and said when you get there and you begin to rejoice and delight in the fact God washed you and the blood, and said, the devil will take a hike. The devil will go. Resist the devil. He'll flee from you. You'll see his dust, he heads on up the road. And you will delight and enjoy in the peace of having been washed in the blood of the Lamb. I'd take the devil back to that Sunday school class. I'd take the devil back to that Sunday morning. I'd take the devil back. into my heart, into my heart, come into my heart, Lord Jesus. I'd take the devil back to the infusing of the Holy Spirit when he moved in me. I'd take the devil back to the joy that flooded my soul. Enjoy the peace that is yours. Because you are saved. This is what happened to you when you got saved. Romans, chapter four, verse five. To him that worketh, not of works. To him that worketh is not believeth. You believe on Jesus. You believe on him that justifyeth the ungodly. Your faith is counted for righteousness. I don't know if y'all are doing it. I don't know how well I'm explaining this. Right now I have got a ton of peace in my heart thinking about heaven, my future hope. And I think I may have two tons of peace in my heart thinking about the fact I was saved by the grace of God. I was there when it happened. I know it. The Holy Ghost bears witness with me that I was saved, that I'm a child of God. Future peace. Past tense peace. Wow. But now neither can be earned. Both are gifts from a gracious God. 
      <br><br>But now, <b>present tense peace</b>. Present tense peace. You will either agree with me or disagree with me. And I'm going to love you either way. I might add, we Christians do not always have present day peace. I say we Christians. I guess Brother Bagwell better speak for himself. I may be speaking to a bunch of super giant Christians in class today. I don't know. I don't always have that rest, that peace. Sometimes I worry. Sometimes I fret. You didn't hear it here. But sometimes I grumble. Sometimes I'm ashamed of the way I do. There are times I've had thoughts that absolutely embarrass me, and I'm certainly not going to tell anybody else about them. There are times the devil talks to me and I shouldn't have listened to him. But I'm afraid I have. At times I've been discouraged and dejected. Present tense peace is different than past tense peace. It's different than first. I didn't work for that. Jesus did the work. I won't work for that. Jesus has got the mentions Jesus provide, Jesus the builder of the New Jerusalem. I that's peace, gift. <b>But present day peace this is going to blow your minds. You have to earn it</b>. You have to work for it, you have to strive for it, you have to agonize for it. You have to be deliberate, you have to be diligent. Here it is, verse eleven let us labor therefore to enter into that rest. Here is a rest. All of a sudden, in verse eleven you have to labor. You have to labor in order to get, enjoy and experience this rest. That verb labor. Spudazo. <u class = "red">Spudazo</u>. This is what it means. Give it all you got. This is what it means. Do your very best. This is what it means. Exert all your energy, all of your mind power, all of your volition will be determined to enter into the everyday rest God has provided for us. Let us labor to enter into the everyday end of that rest. Isn't it strange? In verse number ten, talking about our salvation you have ceased from your own works. Past tense. Rest, salvation. You have ceased. No works ceased from your own work but now present day rest. The very sounds like a contradiction, but it isn't. But let us labor, all of us. Paul said I got to get in on it too. Let us labor, let us work diligently. Work your fingers to the boat. Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest. Present day rest. Not past tense, that's mine. Not future tense, that's mine. Salvation in heaven, present day. Let us labor to enter into that rest. You know what that means? That means when a worry comes, I find me a promise of God and I say shoe, shoe. I shoo away that worry and I lean on my god shall supply all your needs according to his riches and glory. Here comes a temptation. I shoo that temptation away. I quote a verse about the blood of Jesus and then I say there is no temptation taken you but such as it's common demand. But God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted. But he'll make a way of escape that you can bear it. There is victory in Jesus, the world the flesh tries to over here and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. I lean on the pro(?). That takes labor, that takes effort. You got to memorize some Bible. You got to be on your toes. You got to be diligent in every way. Let us labor to enter into this everyday present tense rest. I don't work for heaven. I don't work for heaven. I don't work to get saved. But I must labor to live a life of peace, to live a life of rest day by day by day. 
      <br><br>Let me show you the difference between past tense rest and present tense rest. I think I can do it. From Matthew eleven. Past tense rest. I have already quoted it. Come unto me, all you that labor heavy laden. You're on your way to hell. You're not happy. All your life is unfulfilled. Come into me, and I will give you. It's a gift. I will give you rest. In the very next verse, Matthew 11:29 then Jesus says take my yoke upon you. That's not a gift. Take my yoke. A yoke labor tall plowing the field, living for God overcoming. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me. <b>There's labor in learning the fellowship of his sufferings and the power of his resurrection</b>. I'm meek and lowly, and you shall find rest. A minute ago it was given to me. I got saved. You shall find rest because I've labored, because I've been diligent. You shall find rest under your souls. Given. Rest given what I got say rest to be taken in my everyday life. Rest given the foot of the cross of Calvary. Rest to be found as I daily live for my Savior. Can I explain it in a little bit different way? It's almost a play on words, but I can back it up with.the scripture. When you got saved, past tense rest, you got peace with God. Pete OMA. I am not an enemy of God. In fact, I'll say it without batting an eye. God is my friend. I am one of the fellows in the communion of fellowship, brother and sister in Christ, and we're fellowshipping with Jesus and God and the Holy Ghost right now. Oh, my, yes, I have peace with God. Listen to Romans 5:1. It happened when you got saved for being justified means born again, washed in the blood. Sins are gone, saved being justified by faith. We have peace with God. The moment I got saved, past tense, rest. I had peace with God. <b>But peace with God is different than the peace of God</b>. There's some of you class members, you've got peace with God. You've been saved. He's not your enemy. He's not going to send you to hell. There's heaven waiting for you, future rest. But you don't have peace in the moment. You're worrying, you're fretting, you have turmoil, you have upheaval of all kinds. <b>You don't have the peace of God</b>. I got to learn to trust Him, rely on Him, lean on Him. Find that rest that is available day by day by day. Here's how it's done. Here is the peace of God. Philippians four, six and seven. Listen, don't worry about anything. Try to push those worries out. How can I push those worries out? My God shall supply all my need. How can I take no thought for tomorrow? Don't worry about your clothing, don't worry about food and shelter your Heavenly Father as he feeds the birds, as he clothes the lilies of the field. He will take care of you. Oh, my. Now you begin to get a little bit of the peace of God. Don't be careful for nothing. Don't worry but in everything by prayer. Let your request be made known to God. He'll take care. And if you'll do that, don't worry. Lean on God. Pray about every day and the peace of God learn to live day by day try and the peace of God that passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and your minds be with you day by day by day through Christ Jesus. That's resting momentary early in God's promises, that's victorious Spirit filled Christian living. I got that peace. I got that peace. And now I want to learn to practice and to live day by day with this peace leaning on the promises of Almighty God. 
      <br><br>Now, there's one more clause at the end of verse eleven I think we need to consider. Let's labor to enter into that rest lest any man should fall. The Lord just told us, Paul just told us, the Holy Ghost just told us that if I don't learn to trust Jesus day by day, I can fall. I can fall. The verb is <u class = "red">piptoe</u>. It is a word that is used of a beautiful flower when it's reached its prime, its blooms. And then they wilt and boom. Fall to the ground lest ye fall. After the example of unbelief. After the same example of unbelief. What does that mean, Brother Bagwell? The example of unbelief that was left us by the children of Israel in the wilderness, who refused to trust God. Who refused to lean on the promises of God. And they ended up falling, dying in the wilderness. God forbidding them to go into the land of Canaan because it says here, verse eleven, of their unbelief. That word unbelief combines the little alpha privative. It negates the meaning of a word <u class = "red">awe</u> and <u class = "red">pytho</u>. They were hard hearted. They would not be persuaded that God could keep his word. They were not willing to lean on the truth that God who brought them out of Egypt, could get them into Canaan like he promised he would do. I know some Christians today I know of, I don't know an individual I know of Christians today who though they're saved, though I believe they're going to heaven. They got that rest and they don't have everyday present day rest. They don't have it. They're not leaning on God. They're not trusted. They have not yet been persuaded. God can perform what he promised. Oh, I love those words, god can perform what he promised. God can do everything he said he was going to do, plus he can do exceeding abundantly. Above all, we can ask or think as well. MMM an old preacher I studied early this morning before recording the meditation said this, after salvation, every Christian has a choice. After salvation every Christian has a choice. We can go on everyday life into Holy Ghost living. We can go on into the land of Canaan we can go on the Jews of O, into the land that flows with milk and honey. We can go on to faith rest in the resting in the promises of God. We can go on to victory. Or we can doubt, we can grumble, we can disbelieve, we cannot be persuaded by the promises of God and we can languish and die in the wilderness of dry, barren land or what a shame. What a shame. It all depends. Am I willing now that he gave me that rest and now that he's got me on the way to that rest, am I willing to work diligently, to believe earnestly, to practice from the bottom of my heart, the promises resting on the word of God and the promises of his darling son. Somebody said it this way. You might want to write it down. Salvation is not the end. Salvation is not the end of this thing. The day you got saved, that's not the end of this thing. It's the beginning of this thing. I'm glad I got saved. I'm glad I'm under the blood. I'm still thinking and delighting in the peace that brings me. But every day I want peace. Every day I want Victory. And salvation is a gift. This victory. You got to fight. You got to travail, you got to pray. You got to believe. You got to trust. And Paul uses the example of the Jews in the wilderness to caution us. <b>Not to be guilty of the sins they committed. Not to grumble and gripe and complain and be bitter against God</b>, not to disbelieve God's, I know, but there are giants in land. God can't. God can't help us win the victory. Only Joshua and Caleb said, oh, yes, God can. And only Joshua and Caleb went into the present day land of Canaan, the land of rest. Listen to this verse I've got to close Deuteronomy 6:23. God brought us out the Egypt. God brought us out of Egypt. God brought us out there that he might bring us in and give us the land of Canaan. God brought them out. That's where they got saved. The blood of the lamb was applied to the door post of their homes and the lamb was eaten internalized. <b>They believed on Jesus, but they couldn't trust him day by day to get them into the land of</b>. God brought them out to bring them in. But they would not let God bring them in. 
      <br><br>Recap summary Deuteronomy 1:21. Listen. The Lord thy God has set the land before you victorious Christian living. The land of Canaan to the Jews is not heaven. It's not a picture for you and me. The land of Canaan is not a picture of heaven. Brother Bagel, how do you get that? There were giants in the land of Canaan that had to be fought. There are no giants in heaven that will have to be fought. There were enemies in the land of Canaan that had to be overcome. There are no enemies in heaven that have to be overcome. There was still the flesh to battle in the land of Canaan as we've battled the flesh have our spirit filled. But in heaven there is no flesh. Our flesh has been glorified. It's like the body of our Lord. God wanted to bring him into the land of Canaan. Listen to the next verse. It said but you would not go up. It rebelled against the commandment of the Lord. You grumble. You murmured in your tents, I'm reading from Deuteronomy 1:26 and following, you said, god don't love us, god hates us. He brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us to an enemy and to kill us. Plus all these spies have come back, ten of them. They've discouraged our heart. Those people are giants over there. We can't do that. we can't overcome. God can't do this. And then Deuteronomy one, verse 32 you did not believe a Christian can be guilty of the sin of unbelief. <b>They believed God to save them, but they did not believe God to give them victory day by day by day</b>. You did not believe the Lord your God, and God heard your groveling, and God heard your rebellion, and he was wroth. And he swear not one of these men of this evil generation is going to go into that good land which I swear to give to their fathers. God blocked them. And if I disbelieve, God will not give me sweet peace and victory and rest in Holy Ghost life. If I grumble and gripe and complain, I will not be filled. I will not yield the fruit of the spirit of God in my life. Paul, in one Corinthians 10, am I going on too long, class? Paul, in one Corinthians ten looked at those Jews in the wilderness and he said, they got saved. They were born again. He said they were under the cloud, they passed through the sea. They were baptized under Moses. They ate the same spiritual meat. They ate the same that, and they followed that rock, the rock that gave water, and that rock was Christ. They had an experience with Jesus Christ, but then they doubted. They disbelieved. God was not well pleased. He overthrew them in the wilderness. And they are our examples. First Corinthians ten verse six. They are our examples to the intent we should believe. We should not lust after evil things. We should trust God to lean on his promises day by day by day. They were tempted, they grumbled, they complained. Some of them were destroyed by serpents, brass fool. Incident in Numbers 21, they grumbled they were destroyed by snakes and destroy. These things happen unto them. For examples. They are written for our admonition upon whom the end of the age has come. And if you think you're standing, you better take heila. We could commit the same sins. They grumbling, complaining, bittering, blaming God, not believing his promises. And we would fail to enter into. Our land of Canaan, into Holy Ghost. Victorious spiritually preacher, that's not for me. First Corinthians ten. First to let him that think he. Standeth, take heed, lest he fall. 
      <br><br>We need to pray. God will give us peace, god will give us victory. God will give us rest in day. But we got that past rest, down, born again. We got that future. Rest assured, it's a gift. Heaven. It's an everyday rest we're going to have to claim. We're going to have to believe, we're going to have to fight, we're going to have to trust the honor and the glory of our Lord. What a three verse text? Hebrews four, nine, and ten and eleven. Father, for the class, thank you. For the past tense rest, thank you, you saved. Does somebody raise their hand, say Hallelujah? Thank you, Lord. We're washed in the blood of the lamb we couldn't earn it. You did all the work. Jesus shed his butt. Thank you for past tense rest. Thank you for future tense rest, lord, we believe it. We believe it. I go to prepare a place. If I go, I'm coming again to receive peace. Can't earn it, can't work for it. Thank you, but oh, God I'm going to ask for rest today and tomorrow I'm going to ask rest for our weakest class member and our strongest class member. I'm going to ask rest for every lady, every gentleman, every elderly person, every grandparent, every mama and daddy, every single person, every teenager, every young person. Oh God, help us to learn, to claim, help us to learn to lay hold of that daily victory of that daily rest for your honor and your glory. May we delight in our daily rest, our present rest. May we claim and achieve and fight the fight and win the battle for our everyday rest as the past tense and the future tents in Jesus name, amen. May God give you rest that's my prayer. May God give you rest today. When that doubt comes, run it out of your heart, run it out of your mind resting on one of the good promises, be careful for nothing, don't worry but in everything by prayer and supplicant tell him what you need, don't let the devil send you worry. Tell God what you need, ask and it'll be claim that promise. God again I pray teach us we're all babies help us to learn to grow in the grace of trusting you every hour. Every minute of our lives. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. 
      <br><br>I hope it is in my heart's desire. The Holy Spirit has used our class today to challenge us. To challenge us to get into the battle, to fight the fight, to finish the course, to run the race and enjoy the peace, enjoy the rest God has prepared for us right now, even this very second. If you enjoyed the class, let me know. If you enjoyed our whole discussion on trust, rest and peace in the Lord Jesus. I need some input. Otherwise watched, learned. Your encouragement is a real aid, a real impetus to your preacher, to your teacher, to help us stay in the Word.
