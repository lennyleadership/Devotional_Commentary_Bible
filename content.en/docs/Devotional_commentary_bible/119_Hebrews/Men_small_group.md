Here is the summary.  

God revealed his salvation plan in the OT time.  
Jesus is the caption of the salvation.  
Jesus is perfect in the sense that:  
1) he suffered what we suffered, so that he understood pain in sin;  
2) he was the high priest and the sacrifice.

Moses can't be the sacrifice to the Israelite.  

Two books: The book of life and the lamb's book of life

<h1 id="header_2"><span class = "overline">2023-05-26</span></h1>
Jay was absent.

Shawn and Lenny watched a couple of YouTube videos on Jehovah's Witnesses so that I can show them something I know about them and care for them.  


<h1 id="header_3"><span class = "overline">2023-06-01</span></h1>
We talked about the meeting with Jehovah's Witnesses

I quoted Acts 17:10-11. Believers at Bera ...

Jay recommended the Pilgrim's progress.

Shawn and Jay prayed for me with their hands on shoulder.

The secret of Jesus is not mystery, codes.

Point #1: Prophet
Jesus was a prophet. [Acts 3:22, Deuteronomy 18:15, Matthew 21:46]

Prophet: God sent messages through prophets to people some times.

Point #2: separation from the world, baptism. 

Acts 9:17-18 Paul was filled with the Holy Spirit first, then got baptized.

fulfill the law. Circumcision Exodus 4:24-26 Moses almost forgot to comply with circumcision.  

The meaning of Moses' name [Exodus 2:10]  

Point #3: Plan ahead

God's providence: He took actions before Israelite in Egypt complained.  God Moses, Aaron, Miriam [Micah 6:4]
Shawn's business: trailer delay.

Topic: "Faithful" when rubber meets the road

<h2>Point #1: Do you feel it is a calling to be a leader in church/ prophet?</h2> 

verse 1:  

ESV: share in a heavenly calling.  

NASB/ KJV: partakers of a heavenly calling.

case: deal with confrontation as a leader

case: challenge from the crowd. Would you even question your capability?  

<h2>Point #2: Were you transformed?</h2>

Question: who is the God? (Exodus 3:13)

Question: I am not capable. Moses used to be eloquent (Acts 7:22), but recgonized that he was not eloquent (Exodus 4:10)

Question: They do not believe in me (Exodus 4:20). 

The rod represented the God's presence and God's power.  Who sent you to the Israelite? Moses will prove it with the rod.

(John 5:19-30) Jesus can do nothing by himself.



<h1 id="header_7"><span class = "overline">2023-06-30</span></h1>

Point #1: Why Jesus is greater than Moses?  

<ol>
<li> The different position. 
<br>Jesus was the son of God.   
<br>Moses was a servant.
</li>  

<li> The different work.
<br>Moses gave the law.  
<br>Jesus gave the grace.  
<br>salvation is not earned by work.
</li>

</ol>

Point #2: Law

Galatians 3:24-25 ESV <b>The law was our guardian</b> until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith (refer to Jesus) has come, we are no longer under a guardian.


Point #3: Why Jesus came down to earth 5000 years later?

God's will/truth is like a tree.  The roots of the tree went deep.  The law is like roots, Jesus is like fruit.  Without roots, there will not be fruits.


Point #4: the parallelism structure in chapter 3.



<h1 id="header_7"><span class = "overline">2023-07-07</span></h1>

My question is, I don't know the connection between 4:12 and 4:11. verse 1-11 talk about entering the rest. verse 12 seems to change the topic talking about the power of God's word.







<h1 id="header_7"><span class = "overline">2023-07-14</span></h1>
Point #1: "I am that I am" can also interpret as "I will be that I will be"
It is referred to 7 feasts of the Lord by Gideon Levytam.

Point #2: "boldly" (KJV, NLT), "with confidence"(NASV, ESV) in verse 16.

Point #3: High priest

Jesus went to the highest place firstly, then took us into it.

Point #4: Who is our God?  The God we believe

refer to Psalm 18   

equip<b>ped</b> us with his strength (V32)  

ma<b>d</b>e my feet like the feet of a deer (V33)

train<b>s</b> my hands for war (V34)

ma<b>d</b>e our way blameless (V32)

Encouragement to Shawn for his start-up business. God gives him skills, and will provide him ...

Is a throne a platform or a chair?

<h2>Discussion #1: What does "in Christ" mean?</h2>
Analogy: the ark, the shelter, the chicken wings.

be righteous, be separated, 

<h2>Point #1: The book of Hebrews is like the book of Deuteronomy</h2>

The book of Hebrews to the New Testment is like the book of Deuteronomy to Torah.  Both of them restate what are important in belief foundation.


Hebrews 5:11-14 NLT (or Hebrews 5:11-14 ESV)    
11 About this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.   
12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food,   
13 for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child.   
14 But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.


Hebrews 6:1-2 NLT (or Hebrews 6:1-2 ESV)  
1 Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God  
2 and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.  


<h2>Point #2: God had a plan</h2>

1) God had a plan and prepared ahead.   

Micah 6:4 NLT  (Micah 6:4 ESV)  
4 For I brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from slavery. I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to help you.

God went ahead and took actions before Israelite complained.


<h2>Point #3: God Prepared Moses</h2>
The providential hand of God, God works in unexpected ways.

<ol>
<li>&nbsp;First 40 years
<br>* Moses was trained. He was eloquent.  
<br>&nbsp;Acts 7:22 NLT (or Acts 7:22 ESV)  
<br>&nbsp;Moses was taught all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in both speech and action.
<br>* His faith grew.
<br>&nbsp;Hebrews 11:24-27 NLT
<br>&nbsp;24 It was by faith that Moses, when he <b>grew up</b>, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. 
<br>&nbsp;25 He chose to share the oppression of God’s people instead of enjoying the fleeting pleasures of sin. 
<br>&nbsp;26 He thought it was better to suffer for the sake of Christ than to own the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his great reward. 
<br>&nbsp;27 It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger. He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible. 
<br>&nbsp;Exodus 2:11 NLT (or Exodus 2:11 ESV)
<br>&nbsp;Many years later, when Moses had <b>grown up</b> (40-year-old), he <b>went out</b> to visit his own people, the Hebrews, and he saw how hard they were forced to work. During his visit, he saw an Egyptian beating one of his fellow Hebrews.
<br>&nbsp;Acts 7:23 NLT (or Acts 7:23 ESV)
<br>&nbsp;“One day when Moses was forty years old, he <b>decided</b> to visit his relatives, the people of Israel.
</li>
<li>&nbsp;Second 40 years
<br>&nbsp;Exodus 4:20 NLT (or Exodus 4:20 ESV)
<br>&nbsp;So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and headed back to the land of Egypt. In his hand <b>he carried the staff of God</b>.
</li>
<li>&nbsp;Third 40 years
<br>&nbsp;Hebrews 11:28 NLT
<br>&nbsp;It was by faith that Moses commanded the people of Israel to keep the Passover and to sprinkle blood on the doorposts so that the angel of death would not kill their firstborn sons.
</li>
</ol>
