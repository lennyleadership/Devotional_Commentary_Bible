1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:  
1:2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.  
1:3 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.  
1:4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;  
1:5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,  

1:6 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.  
1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.  
1:8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.  
1:9 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.  
1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,  

1:11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.  
1:12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;  
1:13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.  
1:14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;  
1:15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.  

1:16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.  
1:17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:  
1:18 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.  
1:19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;  
1:20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.

1:1 耶稣基督的启示、就是　神赐给他、叫他将必要快成的事指示他的众仆人。他就差遣使者、晓谕他的仆人约翰。  
1:2 约翰便将　神的道、和耶稣基督的见证、凡自己所看见的、都证明出来。  
1:3 念这书上预言的、和那些听见又遵守其中所记载的、都是有福的。因为日期近了。  
1:4 约翰写信给亚西亚的七个教会。但愿从那昔在今在以后永在的　神。和他宝座前的七灵。  
1:5 并那诚实作见证的、从死里首先复活、为世上君王元首的耶稣基督。有恩惠平安归与你们。他爱我们、用自己的血使我们脱离罪恶。〔脱离有古卷作洗去〕  

1:6 又使我们成为国民、作他父　神的祭司。但愿荣耀权能归给他、直到永永远远。阿们。  
1:7 看哪、他驾云降临。众目要看见他、连刺他的人也要看见他。地上的万族都要因他哀哭。这话是真实的。阿们。  
1:8 主　神说、我是阿拉法、我是俄梅戛、〔阿拉法俄梅戛乃希腊字母首末二字〕是昔在今在以后永在的全能者。  
1:9 我约翰就是你们的弟兄、和你们在耶稣的患难、国度、忍耐里一同有分。为　神的道、并为给耶稣作的见证、曾在那名叫拔摩的海岛上。  
1:10 当主日我被圣灵感动、听见在我后面有大声音如吹号说、  

1:11 你所看见的、当写在书上、达与以弗所、士每拿、别迦摩、推雅推喇、撒狄、非拉铁非、老底嘉、那七个教会。  
1:12 我转过身来、要看是谁发声与我说话。既转过来、就看见七个金灯台。  
1:13 灯台中间、有一位好像人子、身穿长衣、直垂到脚、胸间束着金带。  
1:14 他的头与发皆白、如白羊毛、如雪。眼目如同火焰。  
1:15 脚好像在炉中锻炼光明的铜。声音如同众水的声音。  

1:16 他右手拿着七星。从他口中出来一把两刃的利剑。面貌如同烈日放光。  
1:17 我一看见、就仆倒在他脚前、像死了一样。他用右手按着我说、不要惧怕。我是首先的、我是末后的、  
1:18 又是那存活的。我曾死过、现在又活了、直活到永永远远。并且拿着死亡和阴间的钥匙。  
1:19 所以你要把所看见的、和现在的事、并将来必成的事、都写出来。  
1:20 论到你所看见在我右手中的七星、和七个金灯台的奥秘。那七星就是七个教会的使者。七灯台就是七个教会。
