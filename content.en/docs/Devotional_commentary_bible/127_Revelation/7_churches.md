    <td><p>1. The church of Ephesus  
    <br>The church goes through suffering, and yet they endure.
    <br><br><b>Things are worthy of praise</b>:  
    <br>2:2: God has seen their hard work and their patient endurance. God knows they don’t tolerate evil people. They have examined the claims of those who say they are apostles but are not. They have discovered they are liars.   
    <br>2:3: They have patiently suffered for God without quitting.
    <br>2:6: They hated the evil deeds of the Nicolaitans, just as God does.  
    <br><br><b>Things to be pointed out</b>:  
    <br>2:4: They don’t love God or each other as you did at first!
    </p></td>

    <td><p>2. The church in Smyrna  
    <br>The church goes through suffering.
    <br><br><b>Things are worthy of praise</b>:  
    <br>2:9a I know about your suffering and your poverty — but you are rich!
    <br><i>Note: 2:9b I know the blasphemy of those opposing you. They say they are Jews, but they are not, because their synagogue belongs to Satan.</i>
    </p></td>
    <td><p><br><br><br><b>Encouragement</b>:
    <br>2:10 Don't be afraid of what you are about to suffer.
    <br>2:11 I will give you the crown of life.

    <td><p>3. The church in Pergamos/ Pergamum  
    <br>The church goes through persecution.  
    <br><br><b>Things are worthy of praise</b>:
    <br>2:13 I know that you live in the city where Satan has his throne, yet you have remained loyal to me. You refused to deny me even when Antipas, my faithful witness, was martyred among you there in Satan’s city.  
    <br><br><b>Things are pointed out</b>:
    <br>2:14 You <b>tolerate</b> some among you whose teaching is like that of Balaam, who showed Balak how to trip up the people of Israel. He taught them to sin by <u class = "red">eating food offered to idols</u> and by <u class = "red">committing sexual sin</u>.
<br>2:15 In a similar way, you have some Nicolaitans among you who follow the same teaching.

    <td><p>4. The church in Thyatira
    <br><br><b>Things are worthy of praise</b>:
    <br>2:19 I know all the things you do. I have seen your love, your faith, your service, and your patient endurance. And I can see your constant improvement in all these things.
    <br><br><b>Things are pointed out</b>:
    <br>2:20 You are <b>permitting</b> that woman—that Jezebel who calls herself a prophet—to lead my servants astray. She teaches them to commit sexual sin and to eat food offered to idols.
<br>2:21 I gave her time to repent, but she does not want to turn away from her immorality.
    </p></td>
    <td><p><br><br><b>Encouragement</b>:
    <br>2:24 God will not ask anything more of them.
    <br><br><br><br><br><b>Discipline</b>:
    <br>2:22 I will throw her on a bed of suffering, and those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly unless they repent and turn away from her evil deeds.
<br>2:23 I will strike her children dead. ... And I will give to each of you whatever you deserve.

    <td><p>5. The church in Sardis
    <br><br><b>Things are worthy of praise</b>:
    <br>3:4 There are those who have not soiled their clothes with evil.
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Things to be pointed out</b>:
    <br>3:1 you have a reputation for being alive - but you are dead
    </p></td>
    <td><p><br><br><b>Encouragement</b>:
    <br>3:4 who have not soiled their clothes with evil. They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
<br>3:5 All who are <b>victorious</b> will be clothed in white. I will never erase their names from the Book of Life, but I will announce before my Father and his angels that they are mine.
    <br><br><b>Discipline</b>:
    <br>3:2 Wake up! Strengthen what little remains, for even what is left is almost dead. I find that your actions do not meet the requirements of my God.
<br>3:3 Go back to what you heard and believed at first; hold to it firmly. Repent and turn to me again. If you don’t wake up, I will come to you suddenly, as unexpected as a thief.

    <br><br><b>Things are worthy of praise</b>:
    <br>3:8 I know all the things you do, and I have opened a door for you that no one can close. You have little strength, yet you <b>obeyed</b> my word and did <b>not deny</b> me.
    </p></td>
    <td><p><br><br><b>Encouragement</b>:
    <br>3:8 Those who belong to Satan’s synagogue — those liars who say they are Jews but are not, will acknowledge that you are the ones I love.
    <br>3:10 God will protect you from the great time of testing that will come upon the whole world to test those who belong to this world. 
    <br>3:12 All who are <b>victorious</b> will become pillars in the Temple of my God, and they will never have to leave it. And I will write on them the name of my God, and they will be citizens in the city of my God—the new Jerusalem that comes down from heaven from my God. And I will also write on them my new name.

    <br>3:17 You don’t realize that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.

    <td><p><br><br><br><br><b>Disciplines</b>:
    <br>3:16 I will spit you out of my mouth!
    <br>3:18 buy gold from me—gold that has been purified by fire. Then you will be rich. Also buy white garments from me so you will not be shamed by your nakedness, and ointment for your eyes so you will be able to see.
<br>3:19 I correct and discipline everyone I love. So be diligent and turn from your indifference.
<br>3:20 Look! I <b>stand at the door and knock</b>. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in, and we will share a meal together as friends.
21Those who are <b>victorious</b> will sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat with my Father on his throne.
