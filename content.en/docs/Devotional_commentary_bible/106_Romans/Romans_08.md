8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are <a class = "blue">in Christ Jesus</a>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.  
8:2 For <u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">the law of the Spirit of life</a></u> <a class = "blue">in Christ Jesus</a> hath made me free from t<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">he law of sin and death</a></u>.  
8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:  
8:4 That <u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">the righteousness of the law</a></u> might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.  
8:5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.  

8:6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.  
8:7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.  
8:8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.  
8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.  
8:10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  

8:11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.  
8:12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.  
8:13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  
8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  
8:15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  

8:16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:  
8:17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may <a class = "red">be also glorified</a> together.  
8:18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with <a class = "red">the glory</a> which shall be revealed in us.  
8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.  
8:20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  

8:21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into <a class = "red">the glorious liberty</a> of the children of God.  
8:22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.  
8:23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.  
8:24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  
8:25 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.  

8:26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  
8:27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  
8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.  
8:29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.  
8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also <a class = "red">glorified</a>.  

8:31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?  
8:32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?  
8:33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.  
8:34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.  
8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  

8:36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.  
8:37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.  
8:38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,  
8:39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is <a class = "blue">in Christ Jesus</a> our Lord.

8:1 如今那些在基督耶稣里的、就不定罪了。  
8:2 因为赐生命圣灵的律、在基督耶稣里释放了我、使我脱离罪和死的律了。  
8:3 律法既因肉体软弱、有所不能行的、　神就差遣<u class = "red"><a class = "red">自己的儿子</a></u>、成为罪身的形状、作了赎罪祭、在肉体中定了罪案。  
8:4 使律法的义、成就在我们这不随从肉体、只随从<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">圣灵</a></u>的人身上。  
8:5 因为随从肉体的人、体贴肉体的事。随从圣灵的人、体贴<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">圣灵</a></u>的事。  

8:6 体贴肉体的就是死。体贴<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">圣灵</a></u>的乃是生命平安。  
8:7 原来体贴肉体的、就是与　神为仇。因为不服　神的律法、也是不能服。  
8:8 而且属肉体的人、不能得　神的喜欢。  
8:9 如果　<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">神的灵</a></u>住在你们心里、你们就不属肉体、乃属<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">圣灵</a></u>了。人若没有<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">基督的灵</a></u>、就不是属基督的。  
8:10 基督若在你们心里、身体就因罪而死、心灵却因义而活。  

8:11 然而<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">叫耶稣从死里复活者的灵</a></u>、若住在你们心里、那叫基督耶稣从死里复活的、也必借着<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">住在你们心里的圣灵</a></u>、使你们必死的身体又活过来。  
8:12 弟兄们、这样看来、我们并不是欠肉体的债、去顺从肉体活着。  
8:13 你们若顺从肉体活着必要死。若靠着<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">圣灵</a></u>治死身体的恶行必要活着。  
8:14 因为凡被　<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">神的灵</a></u>引导的、都是　<u class = "red">神的儿子</u>。  
8:15 你们所受的不是奴仆的心、仍旧害怕。所受的乃是<u class = "red">儿子</u>的心、因此我们呼叫阿爸、父。  

8:16 <u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">圣灵</a></u>与我们的心同证我们是　<u class = "red">神的儿女</u>。  
8:17 既是儿女、便是后嗣、就是　<u class = "red">神的后嗣、和基督同作后嗣</u>。如果我们和他一同受苦、也必和他一同得荣耀。  
8:18 我想现在的苦楚、若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀、就不足介意了。  
8:19 受造之物、切望等候　神的众子显出来。  
8:20 因为受造之物服在虚空之下、不是自己愿意、乃是因那叫他如此的。  

8:21 但受造之物仍然指望脱离败坏的辖制、得享　<u class = "red">神儿女</u>自由的荣耀。〔享原文作入〕  
8:22 我们知道一切受造之物、一同叹息劳苦、直到如今。  
8:23 不但如此、就是我们这有圣灵初结果子的、也是自己心里叹息、等候得着<u class = "red">儿子的名分</u>、乃是我们的身体得赎。  
8:24 我们得救是在乎盼望。只是所见的盼望不是盼望。谁还盼望他所见的呢。〔有古卷作人所看见的何必再盼望呢〕  
8:25 但我们若盼望那所不见的、就必忍耐等候。  

8:26 况且我们的软弱有<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">圣灵</a></u>帮助、我们本不晓得当怎样祷告、只是圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息、替我们祷告。  
8:27 鉴察人心的、晓得<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">圣灵</a></u>的意思。因为<u class = "red"><a class = "lemon">圣灵</a></u>照着　神的旨意替圣徒祈求。  
8:28 我们晓得万事都互相效力、叫爱　神的人得益处、就是按他旨意被召的人。  
8:29 因为他预先所知道的人、就预先定下效法<u class = "red">他儿子</u>的模样使<u class = "red">他儿子</u>在许多弟兄中作<u class = "red">长子</u>。  
8:30 预先所定下的人又召他们来。所召来的人、又称他们为义。所称为义的人、又叫他们得荣耀。  

8:31 既是这样、还有甚么说的呢。　神若帮助我们、谁能敌挡我们呢。  
8:32 　神既不爱惜<u class = "red">自己的儿子</u>为我们众人舍了、岂不也把万物和他一同白白的赐给我们么。  
8:33 谁能控告　神所拣选的人呢。有　神称他们为义了。〔或作是称他们为义的　神么〕  
8:34 谁能定他们的罪呢。有基督耶稣已经死了、而且从死里复活、现今在　神的右边、也替我们祈求。〔有基督云云或作是已经死了而且从死里复活现今在　神的右边也替我们祈求的基督耶稣么〕  
8:35 谁能使我们与基督的爱隔绝呢。难道是患难么、是困苦么、是逼迫么、是饥饿么、是赤身露体么、是危险么、是刀剑么。  

8:36 如经上所记、『我们为你的缘故、终日被杀。人看我们如将宰的羊。』  
8:37 然而靠着爱我们的主、在这一切的事上、已经得胜有余了。  
8:38 因为我深信无论是死、是生、是天使、是掌权的、是有能的、是现在的事、是将来的事、  
8:39 是高处的、是低处的、是别的受造之物、都不能叫我们与　神的爱隔绝。这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。
