1 Peter Chapter 1  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,  
1:2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.  
1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,  
1:4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,  
1:5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.  

1:6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:  
1:7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:  
1:8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:  
1:9 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.  
1:10 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:  

1:11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.  
1:12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.  
1:13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;  
1:14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:  
1:15 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;  

1:16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.  
1:17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:  
1:18 For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;  
1:19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:  
1:20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,  

1:21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.  
1:22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:  
1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.  
1:24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:  
1:25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

1 Peter Chapter 2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
2:1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,  
2:2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:  
2:3 If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.  
2:4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,  
2:5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  

2:6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.  
2:7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,  
2:8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.  
2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:  
2:10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.  

2:11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;  
2:12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.  
2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;  
2:14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.  
2:15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:  

2:16 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.  
2:17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.  
2:18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.  
2:19 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.  
2:20 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.  

2:21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:  
2:22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:  
2:23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:  
2:24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.  
2:25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

1 Peter Chapter 3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
3:1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;  
3:2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.  
3:3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;  
3:4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.  
3:5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:  

3:6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.  
3:7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.  
3:8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:  
3:9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.  
3:10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:  

3:11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.  
3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.  
3:13 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?  
3:14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;  
3:15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:  

3:16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.  
3:17 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.  
3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:  
3:19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;  
3:20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.  

3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:  
3:22 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Peter Chapter 4  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
4:1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;  
4:2 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.  
4:3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:  
4:4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:  
4:5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.  

4:6 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.  
4:7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.  
4:8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.  
4:9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.  
4:10 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.  

4:11 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.  
4:12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:  
4:13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.  
4:14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.  
4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.  

4:16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.  
4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?  
4:18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?  
4:19 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.  

* ----------------------------------------
1 Peter Chapter 5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
5:1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:  
5:2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;  
5:3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.  
5:4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.  
5:5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.  

5:6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:  
5:7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.  
5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:  
5:9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.  
5:10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.  

5:11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.  
5:12 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.  
5:13 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.  
5:14 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

## 彼得前书 1章  

1:1 耶稣基督的使徒彼得、写信给那分散在本都、加拉太、加帕多家、亚西亚、庇推尼寄居的。  
1:2 就是照父　神的先见被拣选、借着圣灵得成圣洁、以致顺服耶稣基督、又蒙他血所洒的人。愿恩惠平安、多多的加给你们。  
1:3 愿颂赞归与我们主耶稣基督的父　神、他曾照自己的大怜悯、借耶稣基督从死里复活、重生了我们、叫我们有活泼的盼望、  
1:4 可以得着不能朽坏、不能玷污、不能衰残、为你们存留在天上的基业。  
1:5 你们这因信蒙　神能力保守的人、必能得着所预备、到末世要显现的救恩。  

1:6 因此、你们是大有喜乐、但如今、在百般的试炼中暂时忧愁。  
1:7 叫你们的信心既被试验、就比那被火试验、仍然能坏的金子、更显宝贵。可以在耶稣基督显现的时候、得着称赞、荣耀、尊贵。  
1:8 你们虽然没有见过他、却是爱他。如今虽不得看见、却因信他就有说不出来、满有荣光的大喜乐。  
1:9 并且得着你们信心的果效、就是灵魂的救恩。  
1:10 论到这救恩、那预先说你们要得恩典的众先知、早已详细的寻求考察。  

1:11 就是考察在他们心里基督的灵、预先证明基督受苦难、后来得荣耀、是指着甚么时候、并怎样的时候。  
1:12 他们得了启示、知道他们所传讲的一切事、〔传讲原文作服事〕不是为自己、乃是为你们。那靠着从天上差来的圣灵、传福音给你们的人、现在将这些事报给你们。天使也愿意详细察看这些事。  
1:13 所以要约束你们的心、〔原文作束上你们心中的腰〕谨慎自守、专心盼望耶稣基督显现的时候所带来给你们的恩。  
1:14 你们既作顺命的儿女、就不要效法从前蒙昧无知的时候、那放纵私欲的样子。  
1:15 那召你们的既是圣洁、你们在一切所行的事上也要圣洁。  

1:16 因为经上记着说、『你们要圣洁、因为我是圣洁的。』  
1:17 你们既称那不偏待人、按各人行为审判人的主为父、就当存敬畏的心、度你们在世寄居的日子。  
1:18 知道你们得赎、脱去你们祖宗所传流虚妄的行为、不是凭着能坏的金银等物。  
1:19 乃是凭着基督的宝血、如同无瑕疵无玷污的羔羊之血。  
1:20 基督在创世以前、是预先被　神知道的、却在这末世、才为你们显现。  

1:21 你们也因着他、信那叫他从死里复活、又给他荣耀的　神、叫你们的信心、和盼望、都在于　神。  
1:22 你们既因顺从真理、洁净了自己的心、以致爱弟兄没有虚假、就当从心里彼此切实相爱。  〔从心里有古卷作从清洁的心〕  
1:23 你们蒙了重生、不是由于能坏的种子、乃是由于不能坏的种子、是借着　神活泼常存的道。  
1:24 因为『凡有血气的、尽都如草、他的美荣、都像草上的花。  草必枯干、花必凋谢。  
1:25 惟有主的道是永存的。  』  所传给你们的福音就是这道。  


 ----------------------------------------

## 彼得前书 2章  

2:1 所以你们既除去一切的恶毒、〔或作阴毒〕诡诈、并假善、嫉妒、和一切毁谤的话、  
2:2 就要爱慕那纯净的灵奶、像才生的婴孩爱慕奶一样、叫你们因此渐长、以致得救。  
2:3 你们若尝过主恩的滋味、就必如此。  
2:4 主乃活石。固然是被人所弃的、却是被　神所拣选所宝贵的。  
2:5 你们来到主面前、也就像活石、被建造成为灵宫、作圣洁的祭司、借着耶稣基督奉献　神所悦纳的灵祭。  

2:6 因为经上说、『看哪、我把所拣选所宝贵的房角石、安放在锡安。信靠他的人、必不至于羞愧。』  
2:7 所以他在你们信的人就为宝贵、在那不信的人有话说、『匠人所弃的石头、已作了房角的头块石头。』  
2:8 又说、『作了绊脚的石头、跌人的磐石。』 他们既不顺从、就在道理上绊跌。〔或作他们绊跌都因不顺从道理〕他们这样绊跌也是预定的。  
2:9 惟有你们是被拣选的族类、是有君尊的祭司、是圣洁的国度、是属　神的子民、要叫你们宣扬那召你们出黑暗入奇妙光明者的美德。  
2:10 你们从前算不得子民、现在却作了　神的子民。从前未曾蒙怜恤、现在却蒙了怜恤。  

2:11 亲爱的弟兄阿、你们是客旅、是寄居的。我劝你们要禁戒肉体的私欲。这私欲是与灵魂争战的。  
2:12 你们在外邦人中、应当品行端正、叫那些毁谤你们是作恶的、因看见你们的好行为、便在鉴察的日子、〔鉴察或作眷顾〕归荣耀给　神。  
2:13 你们为主的缘故、要顺服人的一切制度、或是在上的君王、
2:14 或是君王所派罚恶赏善的臣宰。  
2:15 因为　神的旨意原是要你们行善、可以堵住那糊涂无知人的口。  

2:16 你们虽是自由的、却不可借着自由遮盖恶毒、〔或作阴毒〕总要作　神的仆人。  
2:17 务要尊敬众人。亲爱教中的弟兄。敬畏　神。尊敬君王。  
2:18 你们作仆人的、凡事要存敬畏的心顺服主人。不但顺服那善良温和的、就是那乖僻的也要顺服。  
2:19 倘若人为叫良心对得住　神、就忍受冤屈的苦楚、这是可喜爱的。  
2:20 你们若因犯罪受责打、能忍耐、有甚么可夸的呢。但你们若因行善受苦、能忍耐、这在　神看是可喜爱的。  

2:21 你们蒙召原是为此。因基督也为你们受过苦、给你们留下榜样、叫你们跟随他的脚踪行。  
2:22 他并没有犯罪、口里也没有诡诈。  
2:23 他被骂不还口。受害不说威吓的话。只将自己交托那按公义审判人的主。  
2:24 他被挂在木头上亲身担当了我们的罪、使我们既然在罪上死、就得以在义上活。因他受的鞭伤、你们便得了医治。  
2:25 你们从前好像迷路的羊。如今却归到你们灵魂的牧人监督了。  


 ----------------------------------------

## 彼得前书 3章  

3:1 你们作妻子的、要顺服自己的丈夫。这样、若有不信从道理的丈夫、他们虽然不听道、也可以因妻子的品行被感化过来。  
3:2 这正是因看见你们有贞洁的品行、和敬畏的心。  
3:3 你们不要以外面的辫头发、戴金饰、穿美衣、为妆饰、  
3:4 只要以里面存着长久温柔安静的心为妆饰。  这在　神面前是极宝贵的。  
3:5 因为古时仰赖　神的圣洁妇人、正是以此为妆饰、顺服自己的丈夫。  

3:6 就如撒拉听从亚伯拉罕、称他为主。  你们若行善、不因恐吓而害怕、便是撒拉的女儿了。  
3:7 你们作丈夫的、也要按情理和妻子同住。〔情理原文作知识〕因他比你软弱、〔比你软弱原文作是软弱的器皿〕与你一同承受生命之恩的、所以要敬重他。这样便叫你们的祷告没有阻碍。  
3:8 总而言之、你们都要同心、彼此体恤、相爱如弟兄、存慈怜谦卑的心。  
3:9 不以恶报恶、以辱骂还辱骂、倒要祝福。  因你们是为此蒙召、好叫你们承受福气。  
3:10 因为经上说、『人若爱生命、愿享美福、须要禁止舌头不出恶言、嘴唇不说诡诈的话。  

3:11 也要离恶行善。寻求和睦、一心追赶。  
3:12 因为主的眼看顾义人、主的耳听他们的祈祷。  惟有行恶的人、主向他们变脸。』  
3:13 你们若是热心行善、有谁害你们呢。  
3:14 你们就是为义受苦、也是有福的。不要怕人的威吓、也不要惊慌。〔的威吓或作所怕的〕  
3:15 只要心里尊主基督为圣。有人问你们心中盼望的缘由、就要常作准备、以温柔敬畏的心回答各人。  

3:16 存着无亏的良心、叫你们在何事上被毁谤、就在何事上、可以叫那诬赖你们在基督里有好品行的人、自觉羞愧。  
3:17 　神的旨意若是叫你们因行善受苦、总强如因行恶受苦。  
3:18 因基督也曾一次为罪受苦、〔受苦有古卷作受死〕就是义的代替不义的、为要引我们到　神面前。按着肉体说他被治死。按着灵性说他复活了。  
3:19 他借这灵、曾去传道给那些在监狱里的灵听、  
3:20 就是那从前在挪亚预备方舟、　神容忍等待的时候、不信从的人。当时进入方舟、借着水得救的不多、只有八个人。  

3:21 这水所表明的洗礼、现在借着耶稣基督复活。也拯救你们。这洗礼本不在乎除掉肉体的污秽、只求在　神面前有无亏的良心。  
3:22 耶稣已经进入天堂、在　神的右边。  众天使和有权柄的、并有能力的、都服从了他。  

 ----------------------------------------

## 彼得前书 4章  

4:1 基督既在肉身受苦、你们也当将这样的心志作为兵器。  因为在肉身受过苦的、就已经与罪断绝了。  
4:2 你们存这样的心、从今以后、就可以不从人的情欲、只从　神的旨意、在世度余下的光阴。  
4:3 因为往日随从外邦人的心意、行邪淫、恶欲、醉酒、荒宴、群饮、并可恶拜偶像的事、时候已经够了。  
4:4 他们在这些事上、见你们不与他们同奔那放荡无度的路、就以为怪、毁谤你们。  
4:5 他们必在那将要审判活人死人的主面前交帐。  

4:6 为此、就是死人也曾有福音传给他们、要叫他们的肉体按着人受审判、他们的灵性却靠　神活着。  
4:7 万物的结局近了。所以你们要谨慎自守、儆醒祷告。  
4:8 最要紧的是彼此切实相爱。因为爱能遮掩许多的罪。  
4:9 你们要互相款待、不发怨言。  
4:10 各人要照所得的恩赐彼此服事、作　神百般恩赐的好管家。  

4:11 若有讲道的、要按着　神的圣言讲。若有服事人的、要按着　神所赐的力量服事。叫　神在凡事上因耶稣基督得荣耀。原来荣耀权能都是他的、直到永永远远。阿们。  
4:12 亲爱的弟兄阿、有火炼的试验临到你们、不要以为奇怪、（似乎是遭遇非常的事)
4:13 倒要欢喜。因为你们是与基督一同受苦、使你们在他荣耀显现的时候、也可以欢喜快乐。  
4:14 你们若为基督的名受辱骂、便是有福的。因为　神荣耀的灵、常住在你们身上。  
4:15 你们中间却不可有人、因为杀人、偷窃、作恶、好管闲事而受苦。  

4:16 若为作基督徒受苦、却不要羞耻。倒要因这名归荣耀给　神。  
4:17 因为时候到了、审判要从　神的家起首。若是先从我们起首、那不信从　神福音的人、将有何等的结局呢。  
4:18 若是义人仅仅得救、那不虔敬和犯罪的人、将有何地可站呢。  
4:19 所以那照　神旨意受苦的人、要一心为善、将自己灵魂交与那信实的造化之主。  

 ----------------------------------------

## 彼得前书 5章  

5:1 我这作长老、作基督受苦的见证、同享后来所要显现之荣耀的、劝你们中间与我同作长老的人。  
5:2 务要牧养在你们中间　神的群羊、按着　神旨意照管他们。不是出于勉强、乃是出于甘心。  也不是因为贪财、乃是出于乐意。  
5:3 也不是辖制所托付你们的、乃是作群羊的榜样。  
5:4 到了牧长显现的时候、你们必得那永不衰残的荣耀冠冕。  
5:5 你们年幼的、也要顺服年长的。就是你们众人、也都要以谦卑束腰、彼此顺服。因为　神阻挡骄傲的人、赐恩给谦卑的人。  

5:6 所以你们要自卑、服在　神大能的手下、到了时候他必叫你们升高。  
5:7 你们要将一切的忧虑卸给　神、因为他顾念你们。  
5:8 务要谨守、儆醒。因为你们的仇敌魔鬼、如同吼叫的狮子、遍地游行、寻找可吞吃的人。  
5:9 你们要用坚固的信心抵挡他、因为知道你们在世上的众弟兄、也是经历这样的苦难。  
5:10 那赐诸般恩典的　神、曾在基督里召你们、得享他永远的荣耀、等你们暂受苦难之后、必要亲自成全你们、坚固你们、赐力量给你们。  

5:11 愿权能归给他、直到永永远远。阿们。  
5:12 我略略的写了这信、托我所看为忠心的兄弟西拉转交你们、劝勉你们、又证明这恩是　神的真恩。你们务要在这恩上站立得住。  
5:13 在巴比伦与你们同蒙拣选的教会问你们安。我儿子马可也问你们安。  
5:14 你们要用爱心彼此亲嘴问安。愿平安归与你们凡在基督里的人。
