4:1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;  
4:2 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.  
4:3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:  
4:4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:  
4:5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.  

4:6 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.  
4:7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.  
4:8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.  
4:9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.  
4:10 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.  

4:11 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.  
4:12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:  
4:13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.  
4:14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.  
4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.  

4:16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.  
4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?  
4:18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?  
4:19 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.

4:1 基督既在肉身受苦、你们也当将这样的心志作为兵器。  因为在肉身受过苦的、就已经与罪断绝了。  
4:2 你们存这样的心、从今以后、就可以不从人的情欲、只从　神的旨意、在世度余下的光阴。  
4:3 因为往日随从外邦人的心意、行邪淫、恶欲、醉酒、荒宴、群饮、并可恶拜偶像的事、时候已经够了。  
4:4 他们在这些事上、见你们不与他们同奔那放荡无度的路、就以为怪、毁谤你们。  
4:5 他们必在那将要审判活人死人的主面前交帐。  

4:6 为此、就是死人也曾有福音传给他们、要叫他们的肉体按着人受审判、他们的灵性却靠　神活着。  
4:7 万物的结局近了。所以你们要谨慎自守、儆醒祷告。  
4:8 最要紧的是彼此切实相爱。因为爱能遮掩许多的罪。  
4:9 你们要互相款待、不发怨言。  
4:10 各人要照所得的恩赐彼此服事、作　神百般恩赐的好管家。  

4:11 若有讲道的、要按着　神的圣言讲。若有服事人的、要按着　神所赐的力量服事。叫　神在凡事上因耶稣基督得荣耀。原来荣耀权能都是他的、直到永永远远。阿们。  
4:12 亲爱的弟兄阿、有火炼的试验临到你们、不要以为奇怪、（似乎是遭遇非常的事)
4:13 倒要欢喜。因为你们是与基督一同受苦、使你们在他荣耀显现的时候、也可以欢喜快乐。  
4:14 你们若为基督的名受辱骂、便是有福的。因为　神荣耀的灵、常住在你们身上。  
4:15 你们中间却不可有人、因为杀人、偷窃、作恶、好管闲事而受苦。  

4:16 若为作基督徒受苦、却不要羞耻。倒要因这名归荣耀给　神。  
4:17 因为时候到了、审判要从　神的家起首。若是先从我们起首、那不信从　神福音的人、将有何等的结局呢。  
4:18 若是义人仅仅得救、那不虔敬和犯罪的人、将有何地可站呢。  
4:19 所以那照　神旨意受苦的人、要一心为善、将自己灵魂交与那信实的造化之主。
