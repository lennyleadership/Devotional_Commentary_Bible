1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,  
1:2 Elect according to <a class ="red>the foreknowledge of God the Father</a>, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.  <a class ="marginnote">verse 2: study on predestination.</a>  
1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,  
1:4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,  
1:5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.  

1:6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:  
1:7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:  
1:8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:  
1:9 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.  
1:10 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:  

1:11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.  
1:12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.  
1:13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;  
1:14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:  
1:15 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;  

1:16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.  
1:17 And if ye call on the Father, <a class = "blue">who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work</a>, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: <a class ="marginnote">verse 17: </a>  
1:18 For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;  
1:19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:  
1:20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,  

1:21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.  
1:22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:  
1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.  
1:24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:  
1:25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

1:1 耶稣基督的使徒彼得、写信给那分散在本都、加拉太、加帕多家、亚西亚、庇推尼寄居的。  
1:2 就是照父　神的先见被拣选、借着圣灵得成圣洁、以致顺服耶稣基督、又蒙他血所洒的人。  愿恩惠平安、多多的加给你们。  
1:3 愿颂赞归与我们主耶稣基督的父　神、他曾照自己的大怜悯、借耶稣基督从死里复活、重生了我们、叫我们有活泼的盼望、  
1:4 可以得着不能朽坏、不能玷污、不能衰残、为你们存留在天上的基业。  
1:5 你们这因信蒙　神能力保守的人、必能得着所预备、到末世要显现的救恩。  

1:6 因此、你们是大有喜乐、但如今、在百般的试炼中暂时忧愁。  
1:7 叫你们的信心既被试验、就比那被火试验、仍然能坏的金子、更显宝贵。  可以在耶稣基督显现的时候、得着称赞、荣耀、尊贵。  
1:8 你们虽然没有见过他、却是爱他。  如今虽不得看见、却因信他就有说不出来、满有荣光的大喜乐。  
1:9 并且得着你们信心的果效、就是灵魂的救恩。  
1:10 论到这救恩、那预先说你们要得恩典的众先知、早已详细的寻求考察。  

1:11 就是考察在他们心里基督的灵、预先证明基督受苦难、后来得荣耀、是指着甚么时候、并怎样的时候。  
1:12 他们得了启示、知道他们所传讲的一切事、〔传讲原文作服事〕不是为自己、乃是为你们。  那靠着从天上差来的圣灵、传福音给你们的人、现在将这些事报给你们。  天使也愿意详细察看这些事。  
1:13 所以要约束你们的心、〔原文作束上你们心中的腰〕  谨慎自守、专心盼望耶稣基督显现的时候所带来给你们的恩。  
1:14 你们既作顺命的儿女、就不要效法从前蒙昧无知的时候、那放纵私欲的样子。  
1:15 那召你们的既是圣洁、你们在一切所行的事上也要圣洁。  

1:16 因为经上记着说、『你们要圣洁、因为我是圣洁的。』  
1:17 你们既称那不偏待人、按各人行为审判人的主为父、就当存敬畏的心、度你们在世寄居的日子。  
1:18 知道你们得赎、脱去你们祖宗所传流虚妄的行为、不是凭着能坏的金银等物。  
1:19 乃是凭着基督的宝血、如同无瑕疵无玷污的羔羊之血。  
1:20 基督在创世以前、是预先被　神知道的、却在这末世、才为你们显现。  

1:21 你们也因着他、信那叫他从死里复活、又给他荣耀的　神、叫你们的信心、和盼望、都在于　神。  
1:22 你们既因顺从真理、洁净了自己的心、以致爱弟兄没有虚假、就当从心里彼此切实相爱。  〔从心里有古卷作从清洁的心〕  
1:23 你们蒙了重生、不是由于能坏的种子、乃是由于不能坏的种子、是借着　神活泼常存的道。  
1:24 因为『凡有血气的、尽都如草、他的美荣、都像草上的花。  草必枯干、花必凋谢。  
1:25 惟有主的道是永存的。  』  所传给你们的福音就是这道。
