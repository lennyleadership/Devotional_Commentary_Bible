3:1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;  
3:2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.  
3:3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;  
3:4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of <a class = "red">a meek and quiet spirit</a>, which is in the sight of God of great price. <a class = "marginnote">v4: a meek and quiet spirit | Jesus has the meek and quiet spirit.  He requested crowds to be quiet when he did miracles.  He was submissive to authority of God the Father.  He did not want to get the crowds distracted by miracles and missed the salvation on the Cross. [23-May-31. LBC]</a>  
3:5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:  

3:6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.  
3:7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.  
3:8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:  
3:9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.  
3:10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:  

3:11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.  
3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.  
3:13 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?  
3:14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;  
3:15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:  

3:16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.  
3:17 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.  
3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:  
3:19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;  
3:20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.  

3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:  
3:22 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

3:1 你们作妻子的、要顺服自己的丈夫。这样、若有不信从道理的丈夫、他们虽然不听道、也可以因妻子的品行被感化过来。  
3:2 这正是因看见你们有贞洁的品行、和敬畏的心。  
3:3 你们不要以外面的辫头发、戴金饰、穿美衣、为妆饰、  
3:4 只要以里面存着长久温柔安静的心为妆饰。  这在　神面前是极宝贵的。  
3:5 因为古时仰赖　神的圣洁妇人、正是以此为妆饰、顺服自己的丈夫。  

3:6 就如撒拉听从亚伯拉罕、称他为主。  你们若行善、不因恐吓而害怕、便是撒拉的女儿了。  
3:7 你们作丈夫的、也要按情理和妻子同住。〔情理原文作知识〕因他比你软弱、〔比你软弱原文作是软弱的器皿〕与你一同承受生命之恩的、所以要敬重他。这样便叫你们的祷告没有阻碍。  
3:8 总而言之、你们都要同心、彼此体恤、相爱如弟兄、存慈怜谦卑的心。  
3:9 不以恶报恶、以辱骂还辱骂、倒要祝福。  因你们是为此蒙召、好叫你们承受福气。  
3:10 因为经上说、『人若爱生命、愿享美福、须要禁止舌头不出恶言、嘴唇不说诡诈的话。  

3:11 也要离恶行善。寻求和睦、一心追赶。  
3:12 因为主的眼看顾义人、主的耳听他们的祈祷。  惟有行恶的人、主向他们变脸。』  
3:13 你们若是热心行善、有谁害你们呢。  
3:14 你们就是为义受苦、也是有福的。不要怕人的威吓、也不要惊慌。〔的威吓或作所怕的〕  
3:15 只要心里尊主基督为圣。有人问你们心中盼望的缘由、就要常作准备、以温柔敬畏的心回答各人。  

3:16 存着无亏的良心、叫你们在何事上被毁谤、就在何事上、可以叫那诬赖你们在基督里有好品行的人、自觉羞愧。  
3:17 　神的旨意若是叫你们因行善受苦、总强如因行恶受苦。  
3:18 因基督也曾一次为罪受苦、〔受苦有古卷作受死〕就是义的代替不义的、为要引我们到　神面前。按着肉体说他被治死。按着灵性说他复活了。  
3:19 他借这灵、曾去传道给那些在监狱里的灵听、  
3:20 就是那从前在挪亚预备方舟、　神容忍等待的时候、不信从的人。当时进入方舟、借着水得救的不多、只有八个人。  

3:21 这水所表明的洗礼、现在借着耶稣基督复活。也拯救你们。这洗礼本不在乎除掉肉体的污秽、只求在　神面前有无亏的良心。  
3:22 耶稣已经进入天堂、在　神的右边。  众天使和有权柄的、并有能力的、都服从了他。
