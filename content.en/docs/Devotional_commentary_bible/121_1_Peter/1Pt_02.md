2:1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,  
2:2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:  
2:3 If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.  
2:4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,  
2:5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  

2:6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.  
2:7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,  
2:8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.  
2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:  
2:10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.  

2:11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;  
2:12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.  
2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;  
2:14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.  
2:15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:  

2:16 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.  
2:17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.  
2:18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.  
2:19 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.  
2:20 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.  

2:21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:  
2:22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:  
2:23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:  
2:24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.  
2:25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

2:1 所以你们既除去一切的恶毒、〔或作阴毒〕  诡诈、并假善、嫉妒、和一切毁谤的话、  
2:2 就要爱慕那纯净的灵奶、像才生的婴孩爱慕奶一样、叫你们因此渐长、以致<mark>得救</mark>。  
2:3 你们若尝过主恩的滋味、就必如此。  
2:4 主乃活石。固然是被人所弃的、却是被　神所拣选所宝贵的。  
2:5 你们来到主面前、也就像活石、被建造成为灵宫、作圣洁的祭司、借着耶稣基督奉献　神所悦纳的灵祭。  

2:6 因为经上说、『看哪、我把所拣选所宝贵的房角石、安放在锡安。  信靠他的人、必不至于羞愧。』  
2:7 所以他在你们信的人就为宝贵、在那不信的人有话说、『匠人所弃的石头、已作了房角的头块石头。』  
2:8 又说、『作了绊脚的石头、跌人的磐石。』 他们既不顺从、就在道理上绊跌。〔或作他们绊跌都因不顺从道理〕他们这样绊跌也是预定的。  
2:9 惟有你们是被拣选的族类、是有君尊的祭司、是圣洁的国度、是属　神的子民、要叫你们宣扬那召你们出黑暗入奇妙光明者的美德。[^1]  
2:10 你们从前算不得子民、现在却作了　神的子民。从前未曾蒙怜恤、现在却蒙了怜恤。  

2:11 亲爱的弟兄阿、你们是客旅、是寄居的。我劝你们要禁戒肉体的私欲。  这私欲是与<mark>灵魂</mark>争战的。  
2:12 你们在外邦人中、应当品行端正、叫那些毁谤你们是作恶的、因看见你们的好行为、便在鉴察的日子、〔鉴察或作眷顾〕归荣耀给　神。  
2:13 你们为主的缘故、要顺服人的一切制度、或是在上的君王、  
2:14 或是君王所派罚恶赏善的臣宰。  
2:15 因为　神的旨意原是要你们行善、可以堵住那糊涂无知人的口。  

2:16 你们虽是自由的、却不可借着自由遮盖恶毒、〔或作阴毒〕总要作　神的仆人。  
2:17 务要尊敬众人。亲爱教中的弟兄。敬畏　神。尊敬君王。  
2:18 你们作仆人的、凡事要存敬畏的心顺服主人。不但顺服那善良温和的、就是那乖僻的也要顺服。  
2:19 倘若人为叫良心对得住　神、就忍受冤屈的苦楚、这是可喜爱的。  
2:20 你们若因犯罪受责打、能忍耐、有甚么可夸的呢。  但你们若因行善受苦、能忍耐、这在　神看是可喜爱的。  

2:21 你们蒙召原是为此。  因基督也为你们受过苦、给你们留下榜样、叫你们跟随他的脚踪行。  
2:22 他并没有犯罪、口里也没有诡诈。  
2:23 他被骂不还口。受害不说威吓的话。只将自己交托那按公义审判人的主。  
2:24 他被挂在木头上亲身担当了我们的罪、使我们既然在罪上死、就得以在义上活。因他受的鞭伤、你们便得了医治。  
2:25 你们从前好像迷路的羊。如今却归到你们灵魂的牧人监督了[^2]。  

[^1]: ‪Exodus‬19:6 (KJV) And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.  
出19:6 (和合本) 你们要归我作祭司的国度，为圣洁的国民。’这些话你要告诉以色列人。”  
[^2]: (1Pe 2:25 KJV)  For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your <mark>souls</mark>.  It mentions souls.
