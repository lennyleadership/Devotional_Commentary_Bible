6:1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.  
6:2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  
6:3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:  
6:4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.  
6:5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  

6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  
6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.  
6:8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.  
6:9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  
6:10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.  

6:11 Give us this day our daily bread.  
6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  
6:13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.  
6:14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:  
6:15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.  

6:16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  
6:17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;  
6:18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.  
6:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:  
6:20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:  

6:21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  
6:22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  
6:23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
6:24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  
6:25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  

6:26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?  
6:27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?  
6:28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:  
6:29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  
6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  

6:31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  
6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.  
6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.  
6:34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

6:1 你们要小心、不可将善事行在人的面前、故意叫他们看见。若是这样、就不能得你们天父的赏赐了。  
6:2 所以你施舍的时候、不可在你前面吹号、像那假冒为善的人、在会堂里和街道上所行的、故意要得人的荣耀。我实在告诉你们、他们已经得了他们的赏赐。  
6:3 你施舍的时候、不要叫左手知道右手所作的。  
6:4 要叫你施舍的事行在暗中、你父在暗中察看、必然报答你。〔有古卷作必在明处报答你〕
6:5 你们祷告的时候、不可像那假冒为善的人、爱站在会堂里、和十字路口上祷告、故意叫人看见。我实在告诉你们、他们已经得了他们的赏赐。  

6:6 你祷告的时候、要进你的内屋、关上门、祷告你在暗中的父、你父在暗中察看、必然报答你。  
6:7 你们祷告、不可像外邦人、用许多重复话。他们以为话多了必蒙垂听。  
6:8 你们不可效法他们。因为你们没有祈求以先、你们所需用的、你们的父早已知道了。  
6:9 所以你们祷告、要这样说。我们在天上的父、愿人都尊你的名为圣。  
6:10 愿你的国降临。愿你的旨意行在地上、如同行在天上。  

6:11 我们日用的饮食、今日赐给我们。  
6:12 免我们的债、如同我们免了人的债。  
6:13 不叫我们遇见试探。救我们脱离凶恶。〔或作脱离恶者〕因为国度、权柄、荣耀、全是你的直到永远、阿们。〔有古卷无因为至阿们等字〕
6:14 你们饶恕人的过犯、你们的天父也必饶恕你们的过犯。  
6:15 你们不饶恕人的过犯、你们的天父也必不饶恕你们的过犯。  

6:16 你们禁食的时候、不可像那假冒为善的人、脸上带着愁容。因为他们把脸弄得难看、故意叫人看出他们是禁食。我实在告诉你们、他们已经得了他们的赏赐。  
6:17 你禁食的时候、要梳头洗脸、  
6:18 不叫人看出你禁食来、只叫你暗中的父看见。你父在暗中察看、必然报答你。  
6:19 不要为自己积攒财宝在地上、地上有虫子咬、能锈坏、也有贼挖窟窿来偷。  
6:20 只要积攒财宝在天上、天上没有虫子咬、不能锈坏、也没有贼挖窟窿来偷。  

6:21 因为你的财宝在那里、你的心也在那里。  
6:22 眼睛就是身上的灯。你的眼睛若瞭亮、全身就光明。  
6:23 你的眼睛若昏花、全身就黑暗。你里头的光若黑暗了、那黑暗是何等大呢。  
6:24 一个人不能事奉两个主。不是恶这个爱那个、就是重这个轻那个。你们不能又事奉　神、又事奉玛门。〔玛门是财利的意思〕
6:25 所以我告诉你们、不要为生命忧虑、吃甚么、喝甚么。为身体忧虑穿甚么。生命不胜于饮食么、身体不胜于衣裳么。  

6:26 你们看那天上的飞鸟、也不种、也不收、也不积蓄在仓里、你们的天父尚且养活他。你们不比飞鸟贵重得多么。  
6:27 你们那一个能用思虑、使寿数多加一刻呢。〔或作使身量多加一肘呢〕
6:28 何必为衣裳忧虑呢。你想野地里的百合花、怎么长起来、他也不劳苦、也不纺线。  
6:29 然而我告诉你们、就是所罗门极荣华的时候、他所穿戴的、还不如这花一朵呢。  
6:30 你们这小信的人哪、野地里的草、今天还在、明天就丢在炉里、　神还给他这样的妆饰、何况你们呢。
