24:1 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.  
24:2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.  
24:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?  
24:4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.  
24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.  

24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.  
24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.  
24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.  
24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.  
24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.  

24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.  
24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.  
24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.  
24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.  
24:15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)

24:16 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:  
24:17 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:  
24:18 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.  
24:19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
24:20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:  

24:21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.  
24:22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.  
24:23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.  
24:24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.  
24:25 Behold, I have told you before.  

24:26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.  
24:27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  
24:28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.  
24:29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:  
24:30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  

24:31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.  
24:32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:  
24:33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.  
24:34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.  
24:35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.  

24:36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.  
24:37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  
24:38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,  
24:39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  
24:40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  

24:41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  
24:42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.  
24:43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.  
24:44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.  
24:45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?  

24:46 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.  
24:47 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.  
24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;  
24:49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;  
24:50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,  

24:51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

24:1 耶稣出了圣殿、正走的时候、门徒进前来、把殿宇指给他看。  
24:2 耶稣对他们说、你们不是看见这殿宇么。我实在告诉你们、将来在这里、没有一块石头留在石头上不被拆毁了。  
24:3 耶稣在橄榄山上坐着、门徒暗暗的来说、请告诉我们、甚么时候有这些事。你降临和世界的末了、有甚么预兆呢。  
24:4 耶稣回答说、你们要谨慎、免得有人迷惑你们。  
24:5 因为将来有好些人冒我的名来、说、我是基督、并且要迷惑许多人。  

24:6 你们也要听见打仗和打仗的风声、总不要惊慌。因为这些事是必须有的。只是末期还没有到。  
24:7 民要攻打民、国要攻打国。多处必有饥荒、地震。  
24:8 这都是灾难的起头。〔灾难原文作生产之难〕
24:9 那时、人要把你们陷在患难里、也要杀害你们。你们又要为我的名、被万民恨恶。  
24:10 那时、必有许多人跌倒、也要彼此陷害、彼此恨恶。  

24:11 且有好些假先知起来、迷惑多人。  
24:12 只因不法的事增多、许多人的爱心、才渐渐冷淡了。  
24:13 惟有忍耐到底的、必然得救。  
24:14 这天国的福音、要传遍天下、对万民作见证、然后末期才来到。  
24:15 你们看见先知但以理所说的、那行毁坏可憎的、站在圣地。（读这经的人须要会意)  

24:16 那时、在犹太的、应当逃到山上。  
24:17 在房上的、不要下来拿家里的东西。  
24:18 在田里的、也不要回去取衣裳。  
24:19 当那些日子、怀孕的和奶孩子的有祸了。  
24:20 你们应当祈求、叫你们逃走的时候、不遇见冬天、或是安息日。  

24:21 因为那时、必有大灾难、从世界的起头、直到如今、没有这样的灾难、后来也必没有。  
24:22 若不减少那日子、凡有血气的、总没有一个得救的。只是为选民、那日子必减少了。  
24:23 那时、若有人对你们说、基督在这里。或说、基督在那里。你们不要信。  
24:24 因为假基督、假先知、将要起来、显大神迹、大奇事。倘若能行、连选民也就迷惑了。  
24:25 看哪、我预先告诉你们了。  

24:26 若有人对你们说、看哪、基督在旷野里。你们不要出去。或说、看哪、基督在内屋中。你们不要信。  
24:27 闪电从东边发出、直照到西边。人子降临、也要这样。  
24:28 尸首在那里、鹰也必聚在那里。  
24:29 那些日子的灾难一过去、日头就变黑了、月亮也不放光、众星要从天上坠落、天势都要震动。  
24:30 那时、人子的兆头要显在天上、地上的万族都要哀哭。他们要看见人子、有能力、有大荣耀、驾着天上的云降临。  

24:31 他要差遣使者、用号筒的大声、将他的选民、从四方、从天这边、到天那边、都招聚了来。〔方原文作风〕
24:32 你们可以从无花果树学个比方。当树枝发嫩长叶的时候、你们就知道夏天近了。  
24:33 这样、你们看见这一切的事、也该知道人子近了、正在门口了。  
24:34 我实在告诉你们、这世代还没有过去、这些事都要成就。  
24:35 天地要废去、我的话却不能废去。  

24:36 但那日子、那时辰、没有人知道、连天上的使者也不知道、子也不知道、惟独父知道。  
24:37 挪亚的日子怎样、人子降临也要怎样。  
24:38 当洪水以前的日子、人照常吃喝嫁娶、直到挪亚进方舟的那日。  
24:39 不知不觉洪水来了、把他们全都冲去。人子降临也要这样。  
24:40 那时、两个人在田里、取去一个、撇下一个。  

24:41 两个女人推磨。取去一个、撇下一个。  
24:42 所以你们要儆醒、因为不知道你们的主是那一天来到。  
24:43 家主若知道几更天有贼来、就必儆醒、不容人挖透房屋。这是你们所知道的。  
24:44 所以你们也要预备。因为你们想不到的时候、人子就来了。  
24:45 谁是忠心有见识的仆人、为主人所派、管理家里的人、按时分粮给他们呢。  

24:46 主人来到、看见他这样行、那仆人就有福了。  
24:47 我实在告诉你们、主人要派他管理一切所有的。  
24:48 倘若那恶仆心里说、我的主人必来得迟、  
24:49 就动手打他的同伴、又和酒醉的人一同吃喝。  
24:50 在想不到的日子、不知道的时辰、那仆人的主人要来、  

24:51 重重的处治他、〔或作把他腰斩了〕定他和假冒为善的人同罪。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。
