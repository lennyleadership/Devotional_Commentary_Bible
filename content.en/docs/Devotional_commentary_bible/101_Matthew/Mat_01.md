1:1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.  
1:2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;  
1:3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;  
1:4 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;  
1:5 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;  

1:6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;  
1:7 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;  
1:8 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;  
1:9 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;  
1:10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;  

1:11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:  
1:12 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;  
1:13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;  
1:14 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;  
1:15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;  

1:16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.  
1:17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.  
1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.  
1:19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.  
1:20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.  

1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.  
1:22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,  
1:23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.  
1:24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:  
1:25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

1:18 耶稣基督降生的事、记在下面。他母亲马利亚已经许配了约瑟、还没有迎娶、马利亚就从圣灵怀了孕。  
1:19 他丈夫约瑟是个义人、不愿意明明的羞辱他、想要暗暗的把他休了。  
1:20 正思念这事的时候、有主的使者向他梦中显现、说、大卫的子孙约瑟、不要怕、只管娶过你的妻子马利亚来。因他所怀的孕、是从圣灵来的。  

1:21 他将要生一个儿子。你要给他起名叫耶稣。因他要将自己的百姓从罪恶里救出来。  
1:22 这一切的事成就、是要应验主借先知所说的话、  
1:23 说、『必有童女、怀孕生子、人要称他的名为以马内利。』（以马内利翻出来、就是　神与我们同在。)  
1:24 约瑟醒了、起来、就遵着主使者的吩咐、把妻子娶过来。  
1:25 只是没有和他同房、等他生了儿子、〔有古卷作等他生了头胎的儿子〕就给他起名叫耶稣。
