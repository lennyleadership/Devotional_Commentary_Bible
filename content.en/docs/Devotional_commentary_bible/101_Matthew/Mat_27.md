27:1 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:  
27:2 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.  
27:3 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,  
27:4 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.  
27:5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.  

27:6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.  
27:7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.  
27:8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.  
27:9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;  
27:10 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.  

27:11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.  
27:12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.  
27:13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?  
27:14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.  
27:15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.  

27:16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.  
27:17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?  
27:18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.  
27:19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.  
27:20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.  

27:21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.  
27:22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.  
27:23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.  
27:24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.  
27:25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.  

27:26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.  
27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.  
27:28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.  
27:29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
27:30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.  

27:31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.  
27:32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.  
27:33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,  
27:34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.  
27:35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.  

27:36 And sitting down they watched him there;  
27:37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  
27:38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.  
27:39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,  
27:40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.  

27:41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,  
27:42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.  
27:43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.  
27:44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.  
27:45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.  

27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  
27:47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.  
27:48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.  
27:49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.  
27:50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.  

27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;  
27:52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,  
27:53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.  
27:54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.  
27:55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:  

27:56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.  
27:57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:  
27:58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.  
27:59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  
27:60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.  

27:61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.  
27:62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,  
27:63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.  
27:64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.  
27:65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.  

27:66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.

27:1 到了早晨、众祭司长和民间的长老、大家商议、要治死耶稣。  
27:2 就把他捆绑解去交给巡抚彼拉多。  
27:3 这时候、卖耶稣的犹大、看见耶稣已经定了罪、就后悔、把那三十块钱、拿回来给祭司长和长老说、  
27:4 我卖了无辜之人的血、是有罪了。他们说、那与我们有甚么相干。你自己承当吧。  
27:5 犹大就把那银钱丢在殿里、出去吊死了。  

27:6 祭司长拾起银钱来说、这是血价、不可放在库里。  
27:7 他们商议、就用那银钱买了窑户的一块田、为要埋葬外乡人。  
27:8 所以那块田、直到今日还叫作血田。  
27:9 这就应了先知耶利米的话、说、『他们用那三十块钱、就是被估定之人的价钱、是以色列人中所估定的、  
27:10 买了窑户的一块田。这是照着主所吩咐我的。』  

27:11 耶稣站在巡抚面前、巡抚问他说、你是犹太人的王么。耶稣说、你说的是。  
27:12 他被祭司长和长老控告的时候、甚么都不回答。  
27:13 彼拉多就对他说、他们作见证、告你这么多的事、你没有听见么。  
27:14 耶稣仍不回答、连一句话也不说、以致巡抚甚觉希奇。  
27:15 巡抚有一个常例、每逢这节期、随众人所要的、释放一个囚犯给他们。  

27:16 当时、有一个出名的囚犯叫巴拉巴。  
27:17 众人聚集的时候、彼拉多就对他们说、你们要我释放那一个给你们。是巴拉巴呢、是称为基督的耶稣呢。  
27:18 巡抚原知道、他们是因为嫉妒才把他解了来。  
27:19 正坐堂的时候、他的夫人打发人来说、这义人的事、你一点不可管。因为我今天在梦中、为他受了许多的苦。  
27:20 祭司长和长老、挑唆众人、求释放巴拉巴、除灭耶稣。  

27:21 巡抚对众人说、这两个人、你们要我释放那一个给你们呢。他们说、巴拉巴。  
27:22 彼拉多说、这样、那称为基督的耶稣、我怎么办他呢。他们都说、把他钉十字架。  
27:23 巡抚说、为甚么呢、他作了甚么恶事呢。他们便极力的喊着说、把他钉十字架。  
27:24 彼拉多见说也无济于事、反要生乱、就拿水在众人面前洗手、说、流这义人的血、罪不在我、你们承当吧。  
27:25 众人都回答说、他的血归到我们、和我们的子孙身上。  

27:26 于是彼拉多释放巴拉巴给他们、把耶稣鞭打了、交给人钉十字架。  
27:27 巡抚的兵就把耶稣带进衙门、叫全营的兵都聚集在他那里。  
27:28 他们给他脱了衣服、穿上一件朱红色袍子。  
27:29 用荆棘编作冠冕、戴在他头上、拿一根苇子放在他右手里。跪在他面前戏弄他说、恭喜犹太人的王阿。  
27:30 又吐唾沫在他脸上、拿苇子打他的头。  

27:31 戏弄完了、就给他脱了袍子、仍穿上他自己的衣服、带他出去、要钉十字架。  
27:32 他们出来的时候、遇见一个古利奈人、名叫西门、就勉强他同去、好背着耶稣的十字架。  
27:33 到了一个地方、名叫各各他、意思就是髑髅地。  
27:34 兵丁拿苦胆调和的酒、给耶稣喝。他尝了、就不肯喝。  
27:35 他们既将他钉在十字架上、就拈阄分他的衣服。  

27:36 又坐在那里看守他。  
27:37 在他头以上、安一个牌子、写着他的罪状、说、这是犹太人的王耶稣。  
27:38 当时、有两个强盗、和他同钉十字架、一个在右边一个在左边。  
27:39 从那里经过的人、讥诮他、摇着头说、  
27:40 你这拆毁圣殿、三日又建造起来的、可以救自己吧。你如果是　神的儿子、就从十字架上下来吧。  

27:41 祭司长和文士并长老、也是这样戏弄他、说、  
27:42 他救了别人、不能救自己。他是以色列的王、现在可以从十字架上下来、我们就信他。  
27:43 他倚靠　神、　神若喜悦他、现在可以救他。因为他曾说、我是　神的儿子。  
27:44 那和他同钉的强盗、也是这样的讥诮他。  
27:45 从午正到申初、遍地都黑暗了。  

27:46 约在申初、耶稣大声喊着说、以利、以利、拉马撒巴各大尼。就是说、我的　神、我的　神、为甚么离弃我。  
27:47 站在那里的人、有的听见就说、这个人呼叫以利亚呢。  
27:48 内中有一个人、赶紧跑去、拿海绒蘸满了醋、绑在苇子上、送给他喝。  
27:49 其余的人说、且等着、看以利亚来救他不来。  
27:50 耶稣又大声喊叫、气就断了。  

27:51 忽然殿里的幔子、从上到下裂为两半。地也震动。磐石也崩裂。  
27:52 坟墓也开了。已睡圣徒的身体、多有起来的。  
27:53 到耶稣复活以后、他们从坟墓里出来、进了圣城、向许多人显现。  
27:54 百夫长和一同看守耶稣的人、看见地震、并所经历的事、就极其害怕、说、这真是　神的儿子了。  
27:55 有好些妇女在那里、远远的观看。他们是从加利利跟随耶稣来服事他的。  

27:56 内中有抹大拉的马利亚、又有雅各和约西的母亲马利亚、并有西庇太两个儿子的母亲。  
27:57 到了晚上、有一个财主、名叫约瑟、是亚利马太来的。他也是耶稣的门徒。  
27:58 这人去见彼拉多、求耶稣的身体。彼拉多就吩咐给他。  
27:59 约瑟取了身体、用干净细麻布裹好、  
27:60 安放在自己的新坟墓里、就是他凿在磐石里的。他又把大石头滚到墓门口、就去了。  

27:61 有抹大拉的马利亚、和那个马利亚在那里、对着坟墓坐着。  
27:62 次日、就是预备日的第二天、祭司长和法利赛人聚集、来见彼拉多、说、  
27:63 大人、我们记得那诱惑人的、还活着的时候、曾说、三日后我要复活。  
27:64 因此、请吩咐人将坟墓把守妥当、直到第三日。恐怕他的门徒来把他偷了去、就告诉百姓说、他从死里复活了。这样、那后来的迷惑、比先前的更利害了。  
27:65 彼拉多说、你们有看守的兵。去吧、尽你们所能的、把守妥当。  

27:66 他们就带着看守的兵同去、封了石头、将坟墓把守妥当。
