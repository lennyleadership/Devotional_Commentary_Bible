9:1 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.  
9:2 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.  
9:3 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.  
9:4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?  
9:5 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?  

9:6 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.  
9:7 And he arose, and departed to his house.  
9:8 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.  
9:9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.  
9:10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.  

9:11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?  
9:12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.  
9:13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.  
9:14 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?  
9:15 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.  

9:16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.  
9:17 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.  
9:18 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.  
9:19 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.  
9:20 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:  

9:21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.  
9:22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.  
9:23 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,  
9:24 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.  
9:25 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.  

9:26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.  
9:27 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.  
9:28 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.  
9:29 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.  
9:30 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.  

9:31 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.  
9:32 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.  
9:33 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.  
9:34 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.  
9:35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.  

9:36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.  
9:37 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;  
9:38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.

对禁食礼仪的挑战  9:14-17   
对观经文：可 2:18-22  路 5:32-39   
路 5:30 的记载可看出发问者是法利赛人，而马太记载是约翰的门徒来询问，因此这件事情可能是约翰的门徒和法利赛人一起来质疑耶稣不但不禁食，还与罪人同吃喝。  
（一）施洗约翰的门徒来见耶稣，质疑耶稣的门徒不像法利赛人与约翰的门徒一样常常禁食。(9:14)   
●「那时」：SG 5119，「在那时候」、「然后」，可能就是筵席举行之时，而按可 2:18 的记载，当时法利赛人和施洗约翰的门徒正在禁食。  
●「禁食」：SG 3522，<u class = "red">「禁戒食物和饮料的宗教仪式」，摩西律法规定百姓一年一次（赎罪日）禁食，表示为罪痛悔 (利 23:27)。日后犹太人增添了其他纪念国难的禁食日 (斯 9:31, 亚 7:5, 8:19)。耶稣时代法利赛人一周禁食两次，在周一和周四禁食，施洗约翰的门徒亦用禁食表明他们悔改的心志</u>。  

（二）耶稣以时间与场合不合适来解释为什么现在门徒不禁食。  (9:15)   
●「新郎」：SG 3566，耶稣自称新郎，可能是把自己看为是旧约 赛 62:5  何 2:19 的「新郎」，也就是与以色列人立了约的上帝。另外施洗约翰也称耶稣是新郎 约 3:29 。  
●「陪伴之人」：SG 3588+SG 5207+SG 3588+SG 3567，直译是「洞房之子」，意思是「婚礼的宾客」。在此应该是指「门徒」。  
●「要离开他们」：直译是「从他们被带走」、「从他们中间除去」，可能有暗示自己将被取去性命的意思。  

当耶稣与门徒同在时应当欢喜快乐，而非禁食。但当耶稣离开他们之时，禁食是合宜的表现。而在 约 3:22-30 中，施洗约翰把耶稣比成新郎，因此耶稣在此用施洗约翰的教训来回答施洗约翰的门徒，应该是很有说服力的。
<u class = "red">显然法利赛人以禁食为敬虔的应有表现，而不顾禁食应有的内涵</u>。但耶稣的回答显示他深知禁食的内涵。如果不是真心的伤心，又何必装成吃不下饭呢？  

（三）耶稣以新布与旧衣服、新酒与旧皮袋来说明新生命与旧传统难以相容。 9:16-17   
●「新」布：SG 46，「未缩水的」、「未加工的」、「新的」。  
● 旧「衣服」：SG 2440，「服饰」、「外袍」。  
「新布与旧衣服」：旧衣服已经缩水过了，而新布还没有缩过水，所以补在一起时，新布将缩水把旧衣服抓破了。  

●「新」酒：SG 3501，「年轻的」、「年幼的」。  
「新酒与旧皮袋」：当时用羊皮袋装酒，当新鲜的葡萄汁发酵成酒时，会产生气体，而新皮袋可随着伸展膨胀。但旧皮袋是已经膨胀过的，所以会被胀破。  
这些比喻都是表示<u class = "red">耶稣带来的新启示是与传统的「仪式主义」不合的。然而传统的影响力还是十分惊人，大多数人还是选择传统</u>。我们有什么文化或信仰传统是敌对真理的吗？

旧约中，通常在叁种情形下禁食：  

第一：是当百姓犯罪悔改时，像君王或大祭司等领袖，披麻蒙灰禁食，最有名的就是尼尼微人。  

第二：是人为了某件事，求神应许。  

第叁：是律法规定某些节日需要禁食，这是法条的规定。  

在新约中，主耶稣被圣灵领到旷野，禁食了40天。耶稣禁食的原因，既不是为了苦难而求神应许，也不是为了犯罪悔改、或是律法规定，而是为了寻求神。因此我们知道禁食的另一种原因，就是要寻求神的旨意。  

禁食的另一个原因，在《马太福音》十七章19-21节，耶稣的门徒出去赶鬼的时候，有些鬼赶不走，「耶稣说：是因为你们的信心小；我实在告诉你们，你们若有信心像一粒芥菜种，就是对这座山说：你从这边挪到那边，它也必挪去；并且你们没有一件不能作的事了。至于这一类的鬼，若不祷告禁食，他就不出来。」  

从这句话我们知道，禁食也是一种「力量」，会有一个出乎你意料之外的力量，所以我们为某一件事情，不一定是赶鬼，也可以禁食。
