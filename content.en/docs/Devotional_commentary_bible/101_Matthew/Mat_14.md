14:1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,  
14:2 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.  
14:3 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.  
14:4 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.  
14:5 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.  

14:6 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.  
14:7 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.  
14:8 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.  
14:9 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.  
14:10 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.  

14:11 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.  
14:12 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.  
14:13 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.  
14:14 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.  
14:15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.  

14:16 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.  
14:17 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.  
14:18 He said, Bring them hither to me.  
14:19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  
14:20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.  

14:21 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.  
14:22 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.  
14:23 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.  
14:24 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.  
14:25 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.  

14:26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.  
14:27 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.  
14:28 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.  
14:29 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.  
14:30 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.  

14:31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?  
14:32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.  
14:33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.  
14:34 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.  
14:35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;  

14:36 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

14:1 那时分封的王希律、听见耶稣的名声、  
14:2 就对臣仆说、这是施洗的约翰从死里复活、所以这些异能从他里面发出来。  
14:3 起先希律为他兄弟腓力的妻子希罗底的缘故、把约翰拿住锁在监里。  
14:4 因为约翰曾对他说、你娶这妇人是不合理的。  
14:5 希律就想要杀他、只是怕百姓。因为他们以约翰为先知。  

14:6 到了希律的生日、希罗底的女儿、在众人面前跳舞、使希律欢喜。  
14:7 希律就起誓、应许随他所求的给他。  
14:8 女儿被母亲所使、就说、请把施洗约翰的头、放在盘子里、拿来给我。  
14:9 王便忧愁、但因他所起的誓、又因同席的人、就吩咐给他。  
14:10 于是打发人去、在监里斩了约翰。  

14:11 把头放在盘子里、拿来给了女子。女子拿去给他母亲。  
14:12 约翰的门徒来、把尸首领去、埋葬了。就去告诉耶稣。  
14:13 耶稣听见了、就上船从那里独自退到野地里去。众人听见、就从各城里步行跟随他。  
14:14 耶稣出来、见有许多的人、就怜悯他们、治好了他们的病人。  
14:15 天将晚的时候、门徒进前来说、这是野地、时候已经过了。请叫众人散开、他们好往村子里去、自己买吃的。  

14:16 耶稣说、不用他们去、你们给他们吃吧。  
14:17 门徒说、我们这里只有五个饼、两条鱼。  
14:18 耶稣说、拿过来给我。  
14:19 于是吩咐众人坐在草地上。就拿着这五个饼、两条鱼、望着天、祝福、擘开饼、递给门徒。门徒又递给众人。  
14:20 他们都吃、并且吃饱了。把剩下的零碎收拾起来、装满了十二个篮子。  

14:21 吃的人除了妇女孩子、约有五千。  
14:22 耶稣随即催门徒上船、先渡到那边去、等他叫众人散开。  
14:23 散了众人以后、他就独自上山去祷告。到了晚上、只有他一人在那里。  
14:24 那时船在海中、因风不顺、被浪摇撼。  
14:25 夜里四更天、耶稣在海面上走、往门徒那里去。  

14:26 门徒看见他在海面上走、就惊慌了、说、是个鬼怪。便害怕、喊叫起来。  
14:27 耶稣连忙对他们说、你们放心。是我、不要怕。  
14:28 彼得说、主、如果是你、请叫我从水面上走到你那里去。  
14:29 耶稣说、你来吧。彼得就从船上下去、在水面上走、要到耶稣那里去。  
14:30 只因见风甚大、就害怕。将要沉下去、便喊着说、主阿、救我。  

14:31 耶稣赶紧伸手拉住他、说、你这小信的人哪、为甚么疑惑呢。  
14:32 他们上了船、风就住了。  
14:33 在船上的人都拜他说、你真是　神的儿子了。  
14:34 他们过了海、来到革尼撒勒地方。  
14:35 那里的人、一认出是耶稣、就打发人到周围地方去、把所有的病人、带到他那里。  

14:36 只求耶稣准他们摸他的衣裳繸子、摸着的人、就都好了。
