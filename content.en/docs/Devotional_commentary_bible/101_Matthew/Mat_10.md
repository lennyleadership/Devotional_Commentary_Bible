10:1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.  
10:2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;  
10:3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;  
10:4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  
10:5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:  

10:6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  
10:7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.  
10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.  
10:9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,  
10:10 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.  

10:11 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.  
10:12 And when ye come into an house, salute it.  
10:13 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.  
10:14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.  
10:15 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.  

10:16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.  
10:17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;  
10:18 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.  
10:19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.  
10:20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.  

10:21 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.  
10:22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.  
10:23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.  
10:24 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.  
10:25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?  

10:26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.  
10:27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.  
10:28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.  
10:29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.  
10:30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  

10:31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.  
10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.  
10:33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.  
10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.  
10:35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.  

10:36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.  
10:37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.  
10:38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.  
10:39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.  
10:40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.  

10:41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.  
10:42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

10:1 耶稣叫了十二个门徒来、给他们权柄、能赶逐污鬼、并医治各样的病症。  
10:2 这十二使徒的名、头一个叫西门、又称彼得、还有他兄弟安得烈。西庇太的儿子雅各、和雅各的兄弟约翰。  
10:3 腓力、和巴多罗买、多马、和税吏马太、亚勒腓的儿子雅各、和达太。  
10:4 奋锐党的西门、还有卖耶稣的加略人犹大。  
10:5 耶稣差这十二个人去、吩咐他们说、外邦人的路、你们不要走。撒玛利亚人的城、你们不要进。  

10:6 宁可往以色列家迷失的羊那里去。  
10:7 随走随传、说、天国近了。  
10:8 医治病人、叫死人复活、叫长大痲疯的洁净、把鬼赶出去。你们白白的得来、也要白白的舍去。  
10:9 腰袋里、不要带金银铜钱。  
10:10 行路不要带口袋、不要带两件褂子、也不要带鞋和拐杖。因为工人得饮食、是应当的。  

10:11 你们无论进那一城、那一村、要打听那里谁是好人、就住在他家、直住到走的时候。  
10:12 进他家里去、要请他的安。  
10:13 那家若配得平安、你们所求的平安、就必临到那家。若不配得、你们所求的平安仍归你们。  
10:14 凡不接待你们、不听你们话的人、你们离开那家、或是那城的时候、就把脚上的尘土跺下去。  
10:15 我实在告诉你们、当审判的日子、所多玛和蛾摩拉所受的、比那城还容易受呢。  

10:16 我差你们去、如同羊进入狼群、所以你们要灵巧像蛇、驯良像鸽子。  
10:17 你们要防备人。因为他们要把你们交给公会、也要在会堂里鞭打你们。  
10:18 并且你们要为我的缘故、被送到诸侯君王面前、对他们和外邦人作见证。  
10:19 你们被交的时候、不要思虑怎样说话、或说甚么话。到那时候、必赐给你们当说的话。  
10:20 因为不是你们自己说的、乃是你们父的灵在你们里头说的。  

10:21 弟兄要把弟兄、父亲要把儿子、送到死地。儿女要与父母为敌、害死他们。  
10:22 并且你们要为我的名、被众人恨恶、惟有忍耐到底的、必然得救。  
10:23 有人在这城里逼迫你们、就逃到那城里去。我实在告诉你们、以色列的城邑、你们还没有走遍、人子就到了。  
10:24 学生不能高过先生、仆人不能高过主人。  
10:25 学生和先生一样、仆人和主人一样、也就罢了。人既骂家主是别西卜、何况他的家人呢。〔别西卜是鬼王的名〕

10:26 所以不要怕他们。因为掩盖的事、没有不露出来的。隐藏的事、没有不被人知道的。  
10:27 我在暗中告诉你们的、你们要在明处说出来。你们耳中所听的、要在房上宣扬出来。  
10:28 那杀身体不能杀灵魂的、不要怕他们。惟有能把身体和灵魂都灭在地狱里的、正要怕他。  
10:29 两个麻雀、不是卖一分银子么。若是你们的父不许、一个也不能掉在地上。  
10:30 就是你们的头发、也都被数过了。  

10:31 所以不要惧怕。你们比许多麻雀还贵重。  
10:32 凡在人面前认我的、我在我天上的父面前、也必认他。  
10:33 凡在人面前不认我的、我在我天上的父面前、也必不认他。  
10:34 你们不要想我来、是叫地上太平。我来、并不是叫地上太平、乃是叫地上动刀兵。  
10:35 因为我来、是叫人与父亲生疏、女儿与母亲生疏、媳妇与婆婆生疏。  

10:36 人的仇敌、就是自己家里的人。  
10:37 爱父母过于爱我的、不配作我的门徒、爱儿女过于爱我的、不配作我的门徒。  
10:38 不背着他的十字架跟从我的、也不配作我的门徒。  
10:39 得着生命的、将要失丧生命。为我失丧生命的、将要得着生命。  
10:40 人接待你们、就是接待我。接待我、就是接待那差我来的。  

10:41 人因为先知的名接待先知、必得先知所得的赏赐、人因为义人的名接待义人、必得义人所得的赏赐。  
10:42 无论何人、因为门徒的名、只把一杯凉水给这小子里的一个喝、我实在告诉你们、这人不能不得赏赐。
