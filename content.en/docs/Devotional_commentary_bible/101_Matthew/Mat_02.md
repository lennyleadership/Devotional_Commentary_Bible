2:1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,  
2:2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.  
2:3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.  
2:4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.  
2:5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,  

2:6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.  
2:7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.  
2:8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.  
2:9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.  
2:10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.  

2:11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.  
2:12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.  
2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.  
2:14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:  
2:15 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.  

2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.  
2:17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,  
2:18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.  
2:19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,  
2:20 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.  

2:21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.  
2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:  
2:23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

2:1 当希律王的时候、耶稣生在犹太的伯利恒。有几个博士从东方来到耶路撒冷、说、  
2:2 那生下来作犹太人之王的在那里。我们在东方看见他的星、特来拜他。  
2:3 希律王听见了、就心里不安。耶路撒冷合城的人、也都不安。  
2:4 他就召齐了祭司长和民间的文士、问他们说、基督当生在何处。  
2:5 他们回答说、在犹太的伯利恒。因为有先知记着说、  

2:6 『犹大地的伯利恒阿、你在犹大诸城中、并不是最小的。因为将来有一位君王、要从你那里出来、牧养我以色列民。』  
2:7 当下希律暗暗的召了博士来、细问那星是甚么时候出现的。  
2:8 就差他们往伯利恒去、说、你们去仔细寻访那小孩子。寻到了、就来报信、我也好去拜他。  
2:9 他们听见王的话、就去了。在东方所看见的那星、忽然在他们前头行、直行到小孩子的地方、就在上头停住了。  
2:10 他们看见那星、就大大的欢喜。  

2:11 进了房子、看见小孩子和他母亲马利亚、就俯伏拜那小孩子、揭开宝盒、拿黄金乳香没药为礼物献给他。  
2:12 博士因为在梦中被主指示、不要回去见希律、就从别的路回本地去了。  
2:13 他们去后、有主的使者向约瑟梦中显现、说、起来、带着小孩子同他母亲、逃往埃及、住在那里、等我吩咐你。因为希律必寻找小孩子要除灭他。  
2:14 约瑟就起来、夜间带着小孩子和他母亲往埃及去。  
2:15 住在那里、直到希律死了。这是要应验主借先知所说的话、说、『我从埃及召出我的儿子来。』  

2:16 希律见自己被博士愚弄、就大大发怒、差人将伯利恒城里、并四境所有的男孩、照着他向博士仔细查问的时候、凡两岁以里的、都杀尽了。  
2:17 这就应了先知耶利米的话、说、  
2:18 『在拉玛听见号咷大哭的声音、是拉结哭他儿女、不肯受安慰、因为他们都不在了。』  
2:19 希律死了以后、有主的使者、在埃及向约瑟梦中显现、说、  
2:20 起来、带着小孩子和他母亲往以色列地去。因为要害小孩子性命的人已经死了。  

2:21 约瑟就起来、把小孩子和他母亲带到以色列地去。  
2:22 只因听见亚基老接着他父亲希律作了犹太王、就怕往那里去。又在梦中被主指示、便往加利利境内去了。  
2:23 到了一座城、名叫拿撒勒、就住在那里。这是要应验先知所说、他将称为拿撒勒人的话了。
