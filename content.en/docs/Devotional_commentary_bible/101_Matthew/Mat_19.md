19:1 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;  
19:2 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.  
19:3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?  
19:4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,  
19:5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?  

19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.  
19:7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?  
19:8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.  
19:9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  
19:10 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.  

19:11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.  
19:12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.  
19:13 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.  
19:14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.  
19:15 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.  

19:16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?  
19:17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.  
19:18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,  
19:19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  
19:20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?  

19:21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.  
19:22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.  
19:23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.  
19:24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  
19:25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?  

19:26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.  
19:27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?  
19:28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  
19:29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.  
19:30 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.

19:1 耶稣说完了这些话、就离开加利利、来到犹太的境界、约但河外。  
19:2 有许多人跟着他。他就在那里把他们的病人治好了。  
19:3 有法利赛人来试探耶稣说、人无论甚么缘故、都可以休妻么。  
19:4 耶稣回答说、那起初造人的、是造男造女、  
19:5 并且说、『因此、人要离开父母、与妻子连合、二人成为一体。』这经你们没有念过么。  

19:6 既然如此、夫妻不再是两个人、乃是一体的了。所以　神配合的、人不可分开。  
19:7 法利赛人说、这样、摩西为甚么吩咐给妻子休书、就可以休他呢。  
19:8 耶稣说、摩西因为你们的心硬、所以许你们休妻。但起初并不是这样。  
19:9 我告诉你们、凡休妻另娶的、若不是为淫乱的缘故、就是犯奸淫了、有人娶那被休的妇人、也是犯奸淫了。  
19:10 门徒对耶稣说、人和妻子既是这样、倒不如不娶。  

19:11 耶稣说、这话不是人都能领受的。惟独赐给谁、谁才能领受。  
19:12 因为有生来是阉人、也有被人阉的、并有为天国的缘故自阉的。这话谁能领受、就可以领受。  
19:13 那时有人带着小孩子来见耶稣、要耶稣给他们按手祷告。门徒就责备那些人。  
19:14 耶稣说、让小孩子到我这里来、不要禁止他们。因为在天国的、正是这样的人。  
19:15 耶稣给他们按手、就离开那地方去了。  

19:16 有一个人来见耶稣说、夫子、〔有古卷作良善的夫子〕我该作甚么善事、才能得永生。  
19:17 耶稣对他说、你为甚么以善事问我呢、只有一位是善的、〔有古卷作你为甚么称我是良善的除了　神以外没有一个良善的〕你若要进入永生、就当遵守诫命。  
19:18 他说、甚么诫命。耶稣说、就是不可杀人、不可奸淫、不可偷盗、不可作假见证、  
19:19 当孝敬父母。又当爱人如己。  
19:20 那少年人说、这一切我都遵守了。还缺少甚么呢。  

19:21 耶稣说、你若愿意作完全人、可去变卖你所有的、分给穷人、就必有财宝在天上、你还要来跟从我。  
19:22 那少年人听见这话、就忧忧愁愁的走了。因为他的产业很多。  
19:23 耶稣对门徒说、我实在告诉你们、财主进天国是难的。  
19:24 我又告诉你们、骆驼穿过针的眼、比财主进　神的国还容易呢。  
19:25 门徒听见这话、就希奇得很、说、这样谁能得救呢。  

19:26 耶稣看着他们说、在人这是不能的。在　神凡事都能。  
19:27 彼得就对他说、看哪、我们已经撇下所有的跟从你、将来我们要得甚么呢。  
19:28 耶稣说、我实在告诉你们、你们这跟从我的人、到复兴的时候、人子坐在他荣耀的宝座上、你们也要坐在十二个宝座上、审判以色列十二个支派。  
19:29 凡为我的名撇下房屋、或是弟兄、姐妹、父亲、母亲、〔有古卷添妻子〕儿女、田地的、必要得着百倍、并且承受永生。  
19:30 然而有许多在前的将要在后、在后的将要在前。
