26:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,  
26:2 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.  
26:3 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,  
26:4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.  
26:5 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.  

26:6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,  
26:7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.  
26:8 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?  
26:9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.  
26:10 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.  

26:11 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.  
26:12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.  
26:13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.  
26:14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,  
26:15 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.  

26:16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.  
26:17 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?  
26:18 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.  
26:19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.  
26:20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.  

26:21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  
26:22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  
26:23 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.  
26:24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.  
26:25 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.  

26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.  
26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;  
26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.  
26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.  
26:30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  

26:31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.  
26:32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.  
26:33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.  
26:34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  
26:35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.  

26:36 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.  
26:37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.  
26:38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.  
26:39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.  
26:40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?  

26:41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.  
26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.  
26:43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.  
26:44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.  
26:45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  

26:46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.  
26:47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.  
26:48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.  
26:49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.  
26:50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.  

26:51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.  
26:52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.  
26:53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?  
26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  
26:55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.  

26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.  
26:57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.  
26:58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.  
26:59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;  
26:60 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,  

26:61 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.  
26:62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  
26:63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.  
26:64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  
26:65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.  

26:66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.  
26:67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,  
26:68 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?  
26:69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.  
26:70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.  

26:71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.  
26:72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.  
26:73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.  
26:74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.  
26:75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

26:1 耶稣说完了这一切的话、就对门徒说、  
26:2 你们知道过两天是逾越节、人子将要被交给人、钉在十字架上。  
26:3 那时、祭司长和民间的长老、聚集在大祭司称为该亚法的院里。  
26:4 大家商议、要用诡计拿住耶稣杀他。  
26:5 只是说、当节的日子不可、恐怕民间生乱。  

26:6 耶稣在伯大尼长大痲疯的西门家里、  
26:7 有一个女人、拿着一玉瓶极贵的香膏来、趁耶稣坐席的时候、浇在他的头上。  
26:8 门徒看见、就很不喜悦、说、何用这样的枉费呢。  
26:9 这香膏可以卖许多钱、赒济穷人。  
26:10 耶稣看出他们的意思、就说、为甚么难为这女人呢。他在我身上作的、是一件美事。  

26:11 因为常有穷人和你们同在。只是你们不常有我。  
26:12 他将这香膏浇在我身上、是为我安葬作的。  
26:13 我实在告诉你们、普天之下、无论在甚么地方传这福音、也要述说这女人所行的、作个记念。  
26:14 当下、十二门徒里、有一个称为加略人犹大的、去见祭司长、说、  
26:15 我把他交给你们、你们愿意给我多少钱。他们就给了他三十块钱。  

26:16 从那时候、他就找机会、要把耶稣交给他们。  
26:17 除酵节的第一天、门徒来问耶稣说、你吃逾越节的筵席、要我们在那里给你预备。  
26:18 耶稣说、你们进城去、到某人那里、对他说、夫子说、我的时候快到了。我与门徒要在你家里守逾越节。  
26:19 门徒遵着耶稣所吩咐的就去预备了逾越节的筵席。  
26:20 到了晚上、耶稣和十二个门徒坐席。  

26:21 正吃的时候、耶稣说、我实在告诉你们、你们中间有一个人要卖我了。  
26:22 他们就甚忧愁、一个一个的问他说、主、是我么。  
26:23 耶稣回答说、同我蘸手在盘子里的、就是他要卖我。  
26:24 人子必要去世、正如经上指着他所写的、但卖人子的人有祸了。那人不生在世上倒好。  
26:25 卖耶稣的犹大问他说、拉比、是我么。耶稣说、你说的是。  

26:26 他们吃的时候、耶稣拿起饼来、祝福、就擘开、递给门徒、说、你们拿着吃。这是我的身体。  
26:27 又拿起杯来、祝谢了、递给他们、说、你们都喝这个。  
26:28 因为这是我立约的血、为多人流出来、使罪得赦。  
26:29 但我告诉你们、从今以后、我不再喝这葡萄汁、直到我在我父的国里、同你们喝新的那日子。  
26:30 他们唱了诗、就出来往橄榄山去。  

26:31 那时、耶稣对他们说、今夜你们为我的缘故、都要跌倒。因为经上记着说、『我要击打牧人、羊就分散了。』  
26:32 但我复活以后、要在你们以先往加利利去。  
26:33 彼得说、众人虽然为你的缘故跌倒、我却永不跌倒。  
26:34 耶稣说、我实在告诉你、今夜鸡叫以先、你要三次不认我。  
26:35 彼得说、我就是必须和你同死、也总不能不认你。众门徒都是这样说、  

26:36 耶稣同门徒来到一个地方、名叫客西马尼、就对他们说、你们坐在这里、等我到那边去祷告。  
26:37 于是带着彼得、和西庇太的两个儿子同去、就忧愁起来、极其难过。  
26:38 便对他们说、我心里甚是忧伤、几乎要死。你们在这里等候、和我一同儆醒。  
26:39 他就稍往前走、俯伏在地、祷告说、我父阿、倘若可行、求你叫这杯离开我。然而不要照我的意思、只要照你的意思。  
26:40 来到门徒那里、见他们睡着了、就对彼得说、怎么样、你们不能同我儆醒片时么。  

26:41 总要儆醒祷告、免得入了迷惑。你们心灵固然愿意、肉体却软弱了。  
26:42 第二次又去祷告说、我父阿、这杯若不能离开我、必要我喝、就愿你的意旨成全。  
26:43 又来见他们睡着了、因为他们的眼睛困倦。  
26:44 耶稣又离开他们去了。第三次祷告、说的话还是与先前一样。  
26:45 于是来到门徒那里、对他们说、现在你们仍然睡觉安歇吧。〔吧或作么〕时候到了、人子被卖在罪人手里了。  

26:46 起来、我们走吧。看哪、卖我的人近了。  
26:47 说话之间、那十二个门徒里的犹大来了、并有许多人、带着刀棒、从祭司长和民间的长老那里、与他同来。  
26:48 那卖耶稣的、给了他们一个暗号、说、我与谁亲嘴、谁就是他。你们可以拿住他。  
26:49 犹大随即到耶稣跟前说、请拉比安。就与他亲嘴。  
26:50 耶稣对他说、朋友、你来要作的事、就作吧。于是那些人上前、下手拿住耶稣。  

26:51 有跟随耶稣的一个人、伸手拔出刀来、将大祭司的仆人砍了一刀、削掉了他一个耳朵。  
26:52 耶稣对他说、收刀入鞘吧。凡动刀的、必死在刀下。  
26:53 你想我不能求我父、现在为我差遣十二营多天使来么。  
26:54 若是这样、经上所说、事情必须如此的话、怎么应验呢。  
26:55 当时、耶稣对众人说、你们带着刀棒、出来拿我、如同拿强盗么。我天天坐在殿里教训人、你们并没有拿我。  

26:56 但这一切的事成就了、为要应验先知书上的话。当下、门徒都离开他逃走了。  
26:57 拿耶稣的人、把他带到大祭司该亚法那里去。文士和长老、已经在那里聚会。  
26:58 彼得远远的跟着耶稣、直到大祭司的院子、进到里面、就和差役同坐、要看这事到底怎样。  
26:59 祭司长和全公会、寻找假见证、控告耶稣、要治死他。  
26:60 虽有好些人来作假见证、总得不着实据。末后有两个人前来说、  

26:61 这个人曾说、我能拆毁　神的殿、三日内又建造起来。  
26:62 大祭司就站起来、对耶稣说、你甚么都不回答么。这些人作见证告你的是甚么呢。  
26:63 耶稣却不言语。大祭司对他说、我指着永生　神、叫你起誓告诉我们、你是　神的儿子基督不是。  
26:64 耶稣对他说、你说的是。然而我告诉你们、后来你们要看见人子、坐在那权能者的右边、驾着天上的云降临。  
26:65 大祭司就撕开衣服说、他说了僭妄的话、我们何必再用见证人呢。这僭妄的话、现在你们都听见了。  

26:66 你们的意见如何。他们回答说、他是该死的。  
26:67 他们就吐唾沫在他脸上、用拳头打他。也有用手掌打他的、说、  
26:68 基督阿、你是先知、告诉我们打你的是谁。  
26:69 彼得在外面院子里坐着、有一个使女前来说、你素来也是同那加利利人耶稣一伙的。  
26:70 彼得在众人面前却不承认、说、我不知道你说的是甚么。  

26:71 既出去、到了门口、又有一个使女看见他、就对那里的人说、这个人也是同拿撒勒人耶稣一伙的。  
26:72 彼得又不承认、并且起誓说、我不认得那个人。  
26:73 过了不多的时候、旁边站着的人前来、对彼得说。你真是他们一党的、你的口音把你露出来了。  
26:74 彼得就发咒起誓的说、我不认得那个人。立时鸡就叫了。  
26:75 彼得想起耶稣所说的话、鸡叫以先、你要三次不认我。他就出去痛哭。
