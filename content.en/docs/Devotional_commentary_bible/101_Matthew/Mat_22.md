22:1 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,  
22:2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,  
22:3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.  
22:4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.  
22:5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:  

22:6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.  
22:7 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.  
22:8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.  
22:9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.  
22:10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.  

22:11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:  
22:12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.  
22:13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  
22:14 For many are called, but few are chosen.  
22:15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.  

22:16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.  
22:17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?  
22:18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?  
22:19 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.  
22:20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?  

22:21 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.  
22:22 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.  
22:23 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,  
22:24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  
22:25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:  

22:26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.  
22:27 And last of all the woman died also.  
22:28 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.  
22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.  
22:30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.  

22:31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,  
22:32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.  
22:33 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.  
22:34 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.  
22:35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,  

22:36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?  
22:37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  
22:38 This is the first and great commandment.  
22:39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  
22:40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.  

22:41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,  
22:42 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.  
22:43 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,  
22:44 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?  
22:45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?  

22:46 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.

22:1 耶稣又用比喻对他们说、  
22:2 天国好比一个王、为他儿子摆设娶亲的筵席。  
22:3 就打发仆人去、请那些被召的人来赴席。他们却不肯来。  
22:4 王又打发别的仆人说、你们告诉那被召的人、我的筵席已经预备好了、牛和肥畜已经宰了、各样都齐备。请你们来赴席。  
22:5 那些人不理就走了。一个到自己田里去。一个作买卖去。  

22:6 其余的拿住仆人、凌辱他们、把他们杀了。  
22:7 王就大怒、发兵除灭那些凶手、烧毁他们的城。  
22:8 于是对仆人说、喜筵已经齐备、只是所召的人不配。  
22:9 所以你们要往岔路口上去、凡遇见的、都召来赴席。  
22:10 那些仆人就出去到大路上、凡遇见的、不论善恶都召聚了来。筵席上就坐满了客。  

22:11 王进来观看宾客、见那里有一个没有穿礼服的。  
22:12 就对他说、朋友、你到这里来、怎么不穿礼服呢。那人无言可答。  
22:13 于是王对使唤的人说、捆起他的手脚来、把他丢在外边的黑暗里。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。  
22:14 因为被召的人多、选上的人少。  
22:15 当时、法利赛人出去商议、怎样就着耶稣的话陷害他。  

22:16 就打发他们的门徒、同希律党的人、去见耶稣说、夫子、我们知道你是诚实人、并且诚诚实实传　神的道、甚么人你都不徇情面、因为你不看人的外貌。  
22:17 请告诉我们、你的意见如何。纳税给该撒、可以不可以。  
22:18 耶稣看出他们的恶意、就说、假冒为善的人哪、为甚么试探我。  
22:19 拿一个上税的钱给我看。他们就拿一个银钱来给他。  
22:20 耶稣说、这像和这号是谁的。  

22:21 他们说、是该撒的。耶稣说、这样、该撒的物当归给该撒、　神的物当归给　神。  
22:22 他们听见就希奇、离开他走了。  
22:23 撒都该人常说没有复活的事。那天、他们来问耶稣说、  
22:24 夫子、摩西说、人若死了、没有孩子、他兄弟当娶他的妻、为哥哥生子立后。  
22:25 从前在我们这里、有弟兄七人。第一个娶了妻、死了、没有孩子、撇下妻子给兄弟。  

22:26 第二第三直到第七个、都是如此。  
22:27 末后、妇人也死了。  
22:28 这样、当复活的时候、他是七个人中、那一个的妻子呢。因为他们都娶过他。  
22:29 耶稣回答说、你们错了。因为不明白圣经、也不晓得　神的大能。  
22:30 当复活的时候、人也不娶也不嫁、乃像天上的使者一样。  

22:31 论到死人复活、　神在经上向你们所说的、你们没有念过么。  
22:32 他说、『我是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神。』　神不是死人的　神、乃是活人的　神。  
22:33 众人听见这话、就希奇他的教训。  
22:34 法利赛人听见耶稣堵住了撒都该人的口、他们就聚集。  
22:35 内中有一个人是律法师、要试探耶稣、就问他说、  

22:36 夫子、律法上的诫命、那一条是最大的呢。  
22:37 耶稣对他说、你要尽心、尽性、尽意、爱主你的　神。  
22:38 这是诫命中的第一、且是最大的。  
22:39 其次也相仿、就是要爱人如己。  
22:40 这两条诫命、是律法和先知一切道理的总纲。  

22:41 法利赛人聚集的时候、耶稣问他们说、  
22:42 论到基督、你们的意见如何。他是谁的子孙呢。他们回答说、是大卫的子孙。  
22:43 耶稣说、这样、大卫被圣灵感动、怎么还称他为主。说、  
22:44 『主对我主说、你坐在我的右边、等我把你仇敌、放在你的脚下。』  
22:45 大卫既称他为主、他怎么又是大卫的子孙呢。  

22:46 他们没有一个人能回答一言。从那日以后、也没有人敢再问他甚么。
