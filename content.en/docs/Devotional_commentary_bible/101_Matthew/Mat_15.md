15:1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,  
15:2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.  
15:3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?  
15:4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.  
15:5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;  

15:6 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.  
15:7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,  
15:8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.  
15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.  
15:10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:  

15:11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.  
15:12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?  
15:13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.  
15:14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.  
15:15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.  

15:16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?  
15:17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?  
15:18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.  
15:19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:  
15:20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.  

15:21 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.  
15:22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.  
15:23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.  
15:24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  
15:25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.  

15:26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.  
15:27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.  
15:28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.  
15:29 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.  
15:30 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:  

15:31 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.  
15:32 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.  
15:33 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?  
15:34 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.  
15:35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.  

15:36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  
15:37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.  
15:38 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.  
15:39 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.

15:1 那时有法利赛人和文士、从耶路撒冷来见耶稣说、  
15:2 你的门徒为甚么犯古人的遗传呢。因为吃饭的时候、他们不洗手。  
15:3 耶稣回答说、你们为甚么因着你们的遗传、犯　神的诫命呢。  
15:4 　神说、当孝敬父母。又说、咒骂父母的、必治死他。  
15:5 你们倒说、无论何人对父母说、我所当奉给你的、已经作了供献。  

15:6 他就可以不孝敬父母。这就是你们借着遗传、废了　神的诫命。  
15:7 假冒为善的人哪、以赛亚指着你们说的预言、是不错的。他说、  
15:8 『这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我、心却远离我。  
15:9 他们将人的吩咐、当作道理教导人、所以拜我也是枉然。』  
15:10 耶稣就叫了众人来、对他们说、你们要听、也要明白。  

15:11 入口的不能污秽人、出口的乃能污秽人。  
15:12 当时、门徒进前来对他说、法利赛人听见这话、不服、你知道么。〔不服原文作跌倒〕
15:13 耶稣回答说、凡栽种的物、若不是我天父栽种的、必要拔出来。  
15:14 任凭他们吧。他们是瞎眼领路的。若是瞎子领瞎子、两个人都要掉在坑里。  
15:15 彼得对耶稣说、请将这比喻讲给我们听。  

15:16 耶稣说、你们到如今还不明白么。  
15:17 岂不知凡入口的、是运到肚子里、又落在茅厕里么。  
15:18 惟独出口的、是从心里发出来的、这才污秽人。  
15:19 因为从心里发出来的、有恶念、凶杀、奸淫、苟合、偷盗、妄证、谤讟。  
15:20 这都是污秽人的。至于不洗手吃饭、那却不污秽人。  

15:21 耶稣离开那里、退到推罗西顿的境内去。  
15:22 有一个迦南妇人、从那地方出来、喊着说、主阿、大卫的子孙、可怜我。我女儿被鬼附得甚苦。  
15:23 耶稣却一言不答。门徒进前来、求他说、这妇人在我们后头喊叫。请打发他走吧。  
15:24 耶稣说、我奉差遣、不过是到以色列家迷失的羊那里去。  
15:25 那妇人来拜他、说、主阿、帮助我。  

15:26 他回答说、不好拿儿女的饼、丢给狗吃。  
15:27 妇人说、主阿、不错。但是狗也吃他主人桌子上掉下来的碎渣儿。  
15:28 耶稣说、妇人、你的信心是大的。照你所要的、给你成全了吧。从那时候、他女儿就好了。  
15:29 耶稣离开那地方、来到靠近加利利的海边、就上山坐下。  
15:30 有许多人到他那里、带着瘸子、瞎子、哑巴、有残疾的、和好些别的病人、都放在他脚前。他就治好了他们。  

15:31 甚至众人都希奇。因为看见哑巴说话残疾的痊癒、瘸子行走、瞎子看见、他们就归荣耀给以色列的　神。  
15:32 耶稣叫门徒来说、我怜悯这众人、因为他们同我在这里已经三天、也没有吃的了。我不愿意叫他们饿着回去、恐怕在路上困乏。  
15:33 门徒说、我们在这野地、那里有这么多的饼、叫这许多人吃饱呢。  
15:34 耶稣说、你们有多少饼。他们说、有七个、还有几条小鱼。  
15:35 他就吩咐众人坐在地上。  

15:36 拿着这七个饼和几条鱼、祝谢了、擘开、递给门徒。门徒又递给众人。  
15:37 众人都吃、并且吃饱了、收拾剩下的零碎、装满了七个筐子。  
15:38 吃的人、除了妇女孩子、共有四千。  
15:39 耶稣叫众人散去、就上船、来到马加丹的境界。
