11:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.  
11:2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,  
11:3 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?  
11:4 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:  
11:5 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.  

11:6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.  
11:7 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?  
11:8 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.  
11:9 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.  
11:10 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.  

11:11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  
11:12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.  
11:13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.  
11:14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.  
11:15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  

11:16 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,  
11:17 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.  
11:18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.  
11:19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.  
11:20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:  

11:21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.  
11:22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.  
11:23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.  
11:24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.  
11:25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.  

11:26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.  
11:27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.  
11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  
11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.  
11:30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

11:1 耶稣吩咐完了十二个门徒、就离开那里、往各城去传道教训人。  
11:2 约翰在监里听见基督所作的事、就打发两个门徒去、  
11:3 问他说、那将要来的是你么、还是我们等候别人呢。  
11:4 耶稣回答说、你们去把所听见所看见的事告诉约翰。  
11:5 就是瞎子看见、瘸子行走、长大痲疯的洁净、聋子听见、死人复活、穷人有福音传给他们。  

11:6 凡不因我跌倒的、就有福了。  
11:7 他们走的时候、耶稣就对众人讲论约翰说、你们从前出到旷野、是要看甚么呢、要看风吹动的芦苇么。  
11:8 你们出去、到底是要看甚么、要看穿细软衣服的人么、那穿细软衣服的人、是在王宫里。  
11:9 你们出去、究竟是为甚么、是要看先知么。我告诉你们、是的、他比先知大多了。  
11:10 经上记着说、『我要差遣我的使者在你前面、预备道路。』所说的就是这个人。  

11:11 我实在告诉你们、凡妇人所生的、没有一个兴起来大过施洗约翰的。然而天国里最小的、比他还大。  
11:12 从施洗约翰的时候到如今、天国是努力进入的、努力的人就得着了。  
11:13 因为众先知和律法说预言、到约翰为止。  
11:14 你们若肯领受、这人就是那应当来的以利亚。  
11:15 有耳可听的、就应当听。  

11:16 我可用甚么比这世代呢。好像孩童坐在街市上、招呼同伴、说、  
11:17 我们向你们吹笛、你们不跳舞。我们向你们举哀、你们不捶胸。  
11:18 约翰来了、也不吃、也不喝、人就说他是被鬼附着的。  
11:19 人子来了、也吃、也喝、人又说他是贪食好酒的人、是税吏和罪人的朋友。但智慧之子、总以智慧为是。〔有古卷作但智慧在行为上就显为是〕
11:20 耶稣在诸城中行了许多异能、那些城的人终不悔改、就在那时候责备他们说、  

11:21 哥拉汛哪、你有祸了、伯赛大阿、你有祸了、因为在你们中间所行的异能、若行在推罗西顿、他们早已披麻蒙灰悔改了。  
11:22 但我告诉你们、当审判的日子、推罗西顿所受的、比你们还容易受呢。  
11:23 迦百农阿你已经升到天上。〔或作你将要升到天上么〕将来必坠落阴间。因为在你那里所行的异能、若行在所多玛、他还可以存到今日。  
11:24 但我告诉你们、当审判的日子、所多玛所受的、比你还容易受呢。  
11:25 那时、耶稣说、父阿、天地的主、我感谢你、因为你将这些事、向聪明通达人、就藏起来、向婴孩、就显出来。  

11:26 父阿、是的、因为你的美意本是如此。  
11:27 一切所有的、都是我父交付我的。除了父、没有人知道子。除了子和子所愿意指示的、没有人知道父。  
11:28 凡劳苦担重担的人、可以到我这里来、我就使你们得安息。  
11:29 我心里柔和谦卑、你们当负我的轭、学我的样式、这样、你们心里就必得享安息。  
11:30 因为我的轭是容易的、我的担子是轻省的。

  "Weary and burdened" is the actual situation of all people in the world, not only the "toil" of life and work, but also the "burden" of sin and the "burden" of the Pharisees' dogma.  To gain the Lord's rest, you must first realize that you are a "laborer and heavy laden person", and then "come" to the Lord.

  "Meekness" does not mean weakness, but gentleness due to obedience to God, not insisting on anything or expecting anything for oneself.  "Humility" is not low self-esteem, but not being proud, and completely submitting to God's will.  "Meekness and lowliness" is the reason why the Lord can rest, and it is also the condition for us to rest.  This rest is the rest of the "heart". Although the external environment may not have changed, the inner one has already enjoyed the rest.  A "yoke" is a wooden crosspiece tied around the necks of a pair of oxen, enabling them to pull loads and plow fields together.  "Take my yoke" refers not to obeying the rules of the law by oneself, but to unite with the Lord, to wear the same yoke, to walk and work together, and to live out the spirit of the law from within.

  The Lord’s likeness is “resting,” the Lord’s yoke is “easy,” and the Lord’s burden is “light.” If we feel restless, not easy, or light, it is probably not from the Lord.  We have not yet fully surrendered within, and we have not yet been yoked together with the Lord, walking together and working together.  Jewish farmers often use the method of putting one yoke to a cattle and a calf for training the calf for labor. In this case, the weight is entirely on the cattle, and the calf just walks along side and learns from the cattle.  If we are equally yoked with the Lord, the Lord Himself has borne the burden of the yoke, and He will give us sufficient grace so that we will not feel the difficulty of taking the Lord's yoke.

  「劳苦担重担」是所有世人的实际情形，不只有生活、工作的「劳苦」，还有罪恶的「重担」、法利赛人教条的「重担」。要得着主的安息，首先必须认识自己是「劳苦担重担的人」，然后「来」到主面前。

  「柔和」不是软弱，而是因顺服神而温柔，不为自己坚持什么、盼望什么。「谦卑」不是自卑，而是不骄傲，完全顺服于神的旨意。「柔和谦卑」是主能安息的理由，也是我们得安息的条件。这个安息是「心里」的安息，虽然外面的环境可能还没改变，但里面却已经得享安息。「轭」是一种木制横档，绑在一对牛的脖子上，使它们能一起拉货、耕地。「当负我的轭」指不是靠自己遵守律法的规条，而是与主联合，同负一轭、同行同工，从生命里面活出律法的精意。

  主的样式是「安息」的，主的轭是「容易」的，主的担子是「轻省」的，如果我们感到不安息、不容易、不轻省，就恐怕不是出乎主的，恐怕我们里面还没有完全降服，还没有与主同负一轭、同行同工。犹太农夫常用大小牛同负一轭的方式，来训练小牛服劳役，在这种情况下，重量全在大牛身上，小牛不过是学大牛的样子，而跟着它走走就是了。我们若与主同负一轭，主自己承当了轭的重负，并且祂还要赐给我们够用的恩典，不叫我们觉得负主轭的艰难。
