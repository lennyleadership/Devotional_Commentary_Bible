4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.  
4:2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.  
4:3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.  
4:4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.  
4:5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,  

4:6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.  
4:7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.  
4:8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;  
4:9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.  
4:10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.  

4:11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.  
4:12 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;  
4:13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:  
4:14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,  
4:15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;  

4:16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.  
4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  
4:18 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.  
4:19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.  
4:20 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.  

4:21 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.  
4:22 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.  
4:23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.  
4:24 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.  
4:25 And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.

4:1 当时、耶稣被圣灵引到旷野、受魔鬼的试探。  
4:2 他禁食四十昼夜、后来就饿了。  
4:3 那试探人的进前来、对他说、你若是　神的儿子、可以吩咐这些石头变成食物。  
4:4 耶稣却回答说、经上记着说、『人活着、不是单靠食物、乃是靠　神口里所出的一切话。』  
4:5 魔鬼就带他进了圣城、叫他站在殿顶上、〔顶原文作翅〕

4:6 对他说、你若是　神的儿子、可以跳下去。因为经上记着说、『主要为你吩咐他的使者、用手托着你、免得你的脚碰在石头上。』  
4:7 耶稣对他说、经上又记着说、『不可试探主你的　神。』  
4:8 魔鬼又带他上了一座最高的山、将世上的万国、与万国的荣华、都指给他看、  
4:9 对他说、你若俯伏拜我、我就把这一切都赐给你。  
4:10 耶稣说、撒但退去吧。〔撒但就是抵挡的意思乃魔鬼的别名〕因为经上记着说、『当拜主你的　神、单要事奉他。』  

4:11 于是魔鬼离了耶稣、有天使来伺候他。  
4:12 耶稣听见约翰下了监、就退到加利利去。  
4:13 后又离开拿撒勒、往迦百农去、就住在那里。那地方靠海、在西布伦和拿弗他利的边界上。  
4:14 这是要应验先知以赛亚的话、  
4:15 说、『西布伦地、拿弗他利地、就是沿海的路、约但河外、外邦人的加利利地。  

4:16 那坐在黑暗里的百姓、看见了大光、坐在死荫之地的人、有光发现照着他们。』  
4:17 从那时候耶稣就传起道来、说、天国近了、你们应当悔改。  
4:18 耶稣在加利利海边行走、看见弟兄二人、就是那称呼彼得的西门、和他兄弟安得烈、在海里撒网。他们本是打鱼的。  
4:19 耶稣对他们说、来跟从我、我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。  
4:20 他们就立刻舍了网、跟从了他。  

4:21 从那里往前走、又看见弟兄二人、就是西庇太的儿子雅各、和他兄弟约翰、同他们的父亲西庇太在船上补网。耶稣就招呼他们。  
4:22 他们立刻舍了船、别了父亲、跟从了耶稣。  
4:23 耶稣走遍加利利、在各会堂里教训人、传天国的福音、医治百姓各样的病症。  
4:24 他的名声就传遍了叙利亚。那里的人把一切害病的、就是害各样疾病、各样疼痛的、和被鬼附的、癫痫的、瘫痪的、都带了来、耶稣就治好了他们。  
4:25 当下、有许多人从加利利、低加波利、耶路撒冷、犹太、约但河外、来跟着他。
