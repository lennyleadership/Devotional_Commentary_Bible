20:1 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.  
20:2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.  
20:3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,  
20:4 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.  
20:5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.  

20:6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?  
20:7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.  
20:8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.  
20:9 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.  
20:10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.  

20:11 And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,  
20:12 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.  
20:13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?  
20:14 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.  
20:15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?  

20:16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.  
20:17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,  
20:18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,  
20:19 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.  
20:20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.  

20:21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.  
20:22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.  
20:23 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.  
20:24 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.  
20:25 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.  

20:26 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;  
20:27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:  
20:28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.  
20:29 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.  
20:30 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.  

20:31 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.  
20:32 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?  
20:33 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.  
20:34 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

20:1 因为天国好像家主、清早去雇人、进他的葡萄园作工。  
20:2 和工人讲定、一天一钱银子、就打发他们进葡萄园去。  
20:3 约在巳初出去、看见市上还有闲站的人。  
20:4 就对他们说、你们也进葡萄园去、所当给的、我必给你们。他们也进去了。  
20:5 约在午正和申初又出去、也是这样行。  

20:6 约在酉初出去、看见还有人站在那里。就问他们说、你们为甚么整天在这里闲站呢。  
20:7 他们说、因为没有人雇我们。他说、你们也进葡萄园去。  
20:8 到了晚上、园主对管事的说、叫工人都来、给他们工钱、从后来的起、到先来的为止。  
20:9 约在酉初雇的人来了、各人得了一钱银子。  
20:10 及至那先雇的来了、他们以为必要多得。谁知也是各得一钱。  

20:11 他们得了、就埋怨家主说、  
20:12 我们整天劳苦受热、那后来的只做了一小时、你竟叫他们和我们一样么。  
20:13 家主回答其中的一人说、朋友、我不亏负你。你与我讲定的、不是一钱银子么。  
20:14 拿你的走吧。我给那后来的和给你一样、这是我愿意的。  
20:15 我的东西难道不可随我的意思用么。因为我作好人、你就红了眼么。  

20:16 这样、那在后的将要在前、在前的将要在后了。〔有古卷在此有因为被召的人多选上的人少〕
20:17 耶稣上耶路撒冷去的时候、在路上把十二个门徒带到一边、对他们说、  
20:18 看哪、我们上耶路撒冷去、人子要被交给祭司长和文士。他们要定他死罪。  
20:19 又交给外邦人、将他戏弄、鞭打、钉在十字架上。第三日他要复活。  
20:20 那时、西庇太儿子的母亲、同他两个儿子上前来、拜耶稣、求他一件事。  

20:21 耶稣说、你要甚么呢。他说、愿你叫我这两个儿子在你国里、一个坐在你右边、一个坐在你左边。  
20:22 耶稣回答说、你们不知道所求的是甚么。我将要喝的杯、你们能喝么。他们说、我们能。  
20:23 耶稣说、我所喝的杯、你们必要喝。只是坐在我的左右、不是我可以赐的。乃是我父为谁预备的、就赐给谁。  
20:24 那十个门徒听见、就恼怒他们弟兄二人。  
20:25 耶稣叫了他们来、说、你们知道外邦人有君王为主治理他们、有大臣操权管束他们。  

20:26 只是在你们中间不可这样。你们中间谁愿为大、就必作你们的用人。  
20:27 谁愿为首、就必作你们的仆人。  
20:28 正如人子来、不是要受人的服事、乃是要服事人。并且要舍命、作多人的赎价。  
20:29 他们出耶利哥的时候、有极多的人跟随他、  
20:30 有两个瞎子坐在路旁、听说是耶稣经过、就喊着说、主阿、大卫的子孙、可怜我们吧。  

20:31 众人责备他们、不许他们作声。他们却越发喊着说、主阿、大卫的子孙、可怜我们吧。  
20:32 耶稣就站住、叫他们来、说、要我为你们作甚么。  
20:33 他们说、主阿、要我们的眼睛能看见。  
20:34 耶稣就动了慈心、把他们的眼睛一摸、他们立刻看见、就跟从了耶稣。
