12:1 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.  
12:2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.  
12:3 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;  
12:4 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?  
12:5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?  

12:6 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.  
12:7 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.  
12:8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.  
12:9 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:  
12:10 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.  

12:11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?  
12:12 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.  
12:13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.  
12:14 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.  
12:15 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;  

12:16 And charged them that they should not make him known:  
12:17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,  
12:18 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.  
12:19 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.  
12:20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.  

12:21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.  
12:22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.  
12:23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?  
12:24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.  
12:25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:  

12:26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?  
12:27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.  
12:28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.  
12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.  
12:30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.  

12:31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.  
12:32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.  
12:33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.  
12:34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  
12:35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.  

12:36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.  
12:37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.  
12:38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.  
12:39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:  
12:40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.  

12:41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.  
12:42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.  
12:43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.  
12:44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.  
12:45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.  

12:46 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.  
12:47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.  
12:48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?  
12:49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
12:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

12:1 那时、耶稣在安息日、从麦地经过。他的门徒饿了、就掐起麦穗来吃。  
12:2 法利赛人看见、就对耶稣说、看哪、你的门徒作安息日不可作的事了。  
12:3 耶稣对他们说、经上记着、大卫和跟从他的人饥饿之时所作的事、你们没有念过么。  
12:4 他怎么进了　神的殿、吃了陈设饼、这饼不是他和跟从他的人可以吃得、惟独祭司才可以吃。  
12:5 再者、律法上所记的、当安息日、祭司在殿里犯了安息日、还是没有罪、你们没有念过么。  

12:6 但我告诉你们、在这里有一人比殿更大。  
12:7 『我喜爱怜恤、不喜爱祭祀。』你们若明白这话的意思、就不将无罪的、当作有罪的了。  
12:8 因为人子是安息日的主。  
12:9 耶稣离开那地方、进了一个会堂。  
12:10 那里有一个人枯干了一只手。有人问耶稣说、安息日治病、可以不可以。意思是要控告他。  

12:11 耶稣说、你们中间谁有一只羊、当安息日掉在坑里、不把他抓住拉上来呢。  
12:12 人比羊何等贵重呢。所以在安息日作善事是可以的。  
12:13 于是对那人说、伸出手来。他把手一伸、手就复了原、和那只手一样。  
12:14 法利赛人出去、商议怎样可以除灭耶稣。  
12:15 耶稣知道了、就离开那里、有许多人跟着他、他把其中有病的人都治好了。  

12:16 又嘱咐他们、不要给他传名。  
12:17 这是要应验先知以赛亚的话、说、  
12:18 『看哪、我的仆人、我所拣选、所亲爱、心里所喜悦的、我要将我的灵赐给他、他必将公理传给外邦。  
12:19 他不争竞、不喧嚷。街上也没有人听见他的声音。  
12:20 压伤的芦苇、他不折断。将残的灯火、他不吹灭。等他施行公理、叫公理得胜。  

12:21 外邦人都要仰望他的名。』  
12:22 当下有人将一个被鬼附着、又瞎又哑的人、带到耶稣那里。耶稣就医治他、甚至那哑巴又能说话、又能看见。  
12:23 众人都惊奇、说、这不是大卫的子孙么。  
12:24 但法利赛人听见、就说、这个人赶鬼、无非是靠着鬼王别西卜阿。  
12:25 耶稣知道他们的意念、就对他们说、凡一国自相分争、就成为荒场、一城一家自相分争、必站立不住。  

12:26 若撒但赶逐撒但、就是自相分争、他的国怎能站得住呢。  
12:27 我若靠着别西卜赶鬼、你们的子弟赶鬼、又靠着谁呢。这样、他们就要断定你们的是非。  
12:28 我若靠着　神的灵赶鬼、这就是　神的国临到你们了。  
12:29 人怎能进壮士家里、抢夺他的家具呢、除非先捆住那壮士、才可以抢夺他的家财。  
12:30 不与我相合的、就是敌我的、不同我收聚的、就是分散的。  

12:31 所以我告诉你们、人一切的罪、和亵渎的话、都可得赦免。惟独亵渎圣灵、总不得赦免。  
12:32 凡说话干犯人子的、还可得赦免。惟独说话干犯圣灵的、今世来世总不得赦免。  
12:33 你们或以为树好、果子也好。树坏、果子也坏。因为看果子、就可以知道树。  
12:34 毒蛇的种类、你们既是恶人、怎能说出好话来呢。因为心里所充满的、口里就说出来。  
12:35 善人从他心里所存的善、就发出善来。恶人从他心里所存的恶、就发出恶来。  

12:36 我又告诉你们、凡人所说的闲话、当审判的日子、必要句句供出来。  
12:37 因为要凭你的话、定你为义、也要凭你的话、定你有罪。  
12:38 当时有几个文士和法利赛人、对耶稣说、夫子、我们愿意你显个神迹给我们看。  
12:39 耶稣回答说、一个邪恶淫乱的世代求看神迹。除了先知约拿的神迹以外、再没有神迹给他们看。  
12:40 约拿三日三夜在大鱼肚腹中。人子也要这样三日三夜在地里头。  

12:41 当审判的时候、尼尼微人、要起来定这世代的罪、因为尼尼微人听了约拿所传的、就悔改了。看哪、在这里有一人比约拿更大。  
12:42 当审判的时候、南方的女王、要起来定这世代的罪、因为他从地极而来、要听所罗门的智慧话。看哪、在这里有一人比所罗门更大。  
12:43 污鬼离了人身、就在无水之地、过来过去、寻求安歇之处、却寻不着。  
12:44 于是说、我要回到我所出来的屋里去。到了、就看见里面空闲、打扫干净、修饰好了。  
12:45 便去另带了七个比自己更恶的鬼来、都进去住在那里。那人末后的景况、比先前更不好了。这邪恶的世代、也要如此。  

12:46 耶稣还对众人说话的时候、不料、他母亲和他弟兄站在外边、要与他说话。  
12:47 有人告诉他说、看哪、你母亲和你弟兄站在外边、要与你说话。  
12:48 他却回答那人说、谁是我的母亲。谁是我的弟兄。  
12:49 就伸手指着门徒说、看哪、我的母亲、我的弟兄。  
12:50 凡遵行我天父旨意的人、就是我的弟兄姐妹和母亲了。
