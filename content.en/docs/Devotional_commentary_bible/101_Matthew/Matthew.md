Matthew Chapter 1  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
1:1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.  
1:2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;  
1:3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;  
1:4 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;  
1:5 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;  

1:6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;  
1:7 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;  
1:8 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;  
1:9 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;  
1:10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;  

1:11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:  
1:12 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;  
1:13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;  
1:14 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;  
1:15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;  

1:16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.  
1:17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.  
1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.  
1:19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.  
1:20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.  

1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.  
1:22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,  
1:23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.  
1:24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:  
1:25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

Matthew Chapter 2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
2:1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,  
2:2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.  
2:3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.  
2:4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.  
2:5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,  

2:6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.  
2:7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.  
2:8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.  
2:9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.  
2:10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.  

2:11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.  
2:12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.  
2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.  
2:14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:  
2:15 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.  

2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.  
2:17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,  
2:18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.  
2:19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,  
2:20 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.  

2:21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.  
2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:  
2:23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

Matthew Chapter 3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
3:1 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,  
3:2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  
3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.  
3:4 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.  
3:5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,  

3:6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.  
3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?  
3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:  
3:9 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.  
3:10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  

3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:  
3:12 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.  
3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.  
3:14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?  
3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.  

3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:  
3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

Matthew Chapter 4  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.  
4:2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.  
4:3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.  
4:4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.  
4:5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,  

4:6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.  
4:7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.  
4:8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;  
4:9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.  
4:10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.  

4:11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.  
4:12 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;  
4:13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:  
4:14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,  
4:15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;  

4:16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.  
4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  
4:18 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.  
4:19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.  
4:20 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.  

4:21 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.  
4:22 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.  
4:23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.  
4:24 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.  
4:25 And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.

Matthew Chapter 5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
5:1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:  
5:2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,  
5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  
5:4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.  
5:5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.  

5:6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.  
5:7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.  
5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.  
5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.  
5:10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  

5:11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.  
5:12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.  
5:13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.  
5:14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  
5:15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  

5:16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.  
5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  
5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  
5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  
5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.  

5:21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:  
5:22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  
5:23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  
5:24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  
5:25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  

5:26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.  
5:27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:  
5:28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.  
5:29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  
5:30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  

5:31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:  
5:32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.  
5:33 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:  
5:34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:  
5:35 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.  

5:36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  
5:37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.  
5:38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  
5:39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  
5:40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.  

5:41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  
5:42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.  
5:43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  
5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  
5:45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  

5:46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?  
5:47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  
5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

Matthew Chapter 6  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34
6:1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.  
6:2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  
6:3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:  
6:4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.  
6:5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  

6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  
6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.  
6:8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.  
6:9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  
6:10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.  

6:11 Give us this day our daily bread.  
6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  
6:13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.  
6:14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:  
6:15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.  

6:16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  
6:17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;  
6:18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.  
6:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:  
6:20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:  

6:21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  
6:22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  
6:23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
6:24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  
6:25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  

6:26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?  
6:27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?  
6:28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:  
6:29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  
6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  

6:31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  
6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.  
6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.  
6:34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

Matthew Chapter 7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
7:1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.  
7:2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.  
7:3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  
7:4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?  
7:5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.  

7:6 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.  
7:7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:  
7:8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.  
7:9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?  
7:10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?  

7:11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?  
7:12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.  
7:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:  
7:14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.  
7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  

7:16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  
7:17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  
7:18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  
7:19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  
7:20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.  

7:21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  
7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  
7:23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.  
7:24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:  
7:25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.  

7:26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:  
7:27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.  
7:28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:  
7:29 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

8:1 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.  
8:2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  
8:3 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.  
8:4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.  
8:5 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,  

8:6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.  
8:7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.  
8:8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.  
8:9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.  
8:10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.  

8:11 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.  
8:12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  
8:13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.  
8:14 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.  
8:15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.  

8:16 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:  
8:17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.  
8:18 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.  
8:19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.  
8:20 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.  

8:21 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  
8:22 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.  
8:23 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.  
8:24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.  
8:25 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.  

8:26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.  
8:27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
8:28 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.  
8:29 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?  
8:30 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.  

8:31 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.  
8:32 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.  
8:33 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.  
8:34 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.

Matthew Chapter 9  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38
9:1 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.  
9:2 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.  
9:3 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.  
9:4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?  
9:5 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?  

9:6 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.  
9:7 And he arose, and departed to his house.  
9:8 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.  
9:9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.  
9:10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.  

9:11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?  
9:12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.  
9:13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.  
9:14 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?  
9:15 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.  

9:16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.  
9:17 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.  
9:18 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.  
9:19 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.  
9:20 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:  

9:21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.  
9:22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.  
9:23 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,  
9:24 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.  
9:25 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.  

9:26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.  
9:27 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.  
9:28 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.  
9:29 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.  
9:30 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.  

9:31 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.  
9:32 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.  
9:33 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.  
9:34 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.  
9:35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.  

9:36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.  
9:37 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;  
9:38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.

Matthew Chapter 10  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42
10:1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.  
10:2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;  
10:3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;  
10:4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  
10:5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:  

10:6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  
10:7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.  
10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.  
10:9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,  
10:10 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.  

10:11 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.  
10:12 And when ye come into an house, salute it.  
10:13 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.  
10:14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.  
10:15 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.  

10:16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.  
10:17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;  
10:18 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.  
10:19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.  
10:20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.  

10:21 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.  
10:22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.  
10:23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.  
10:24 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.  
10:25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?  

10:26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.  
10:27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.  
10:28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.  
10:29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.  
10:30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  

10:31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.  
10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.  
10:33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.  
10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.  
10:35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.  

10:36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.  
10:37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.  
10:38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.  
10:39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.  
10:40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.  

10:41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.  
10:42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

Matthew Chapter 11  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
11:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.  
11:2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,  
11:3 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?  
11:4 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:  
11:5 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.  

11:6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.  
11:7 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?  
11:8 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.  
11:9 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.  
11:10 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.  

11:11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  
11:12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.  
11:13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.  
11:14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.  
11:15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  

11:16 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,  
11:17 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.  
11:18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.  
11:19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.  
11:20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:  

11:21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.  
11:22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.  
11:23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.  
11:24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.  
11:25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.  

11:26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.  
11:27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.  
11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  
11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.  
11:30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

Matthew Chapter 12  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50
12:1 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.  
12:2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.  
12:3 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;  
12:4 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?  
12:5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?  

12:6 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.  
12:7 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.  
12:8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.  
12:9 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:  
12:10 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.  

12:11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?  
12:12 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.  
12:13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.  
12:14 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.  
12:15 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;  

12:16 And charged them that they should not make him known:  
12:17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,  
12:18 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.  
12:19 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.  
12:20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.  

12:21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.  
12:22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.  
12:23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?  
12:24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.  
12:25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:  

12:26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?  
12:27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.  
12:28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.  
12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.  
12:30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.  

12:31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.  
12:32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.  
12:33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.  
12:34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  
12:35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.  

12:36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.  
12:37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.  
12:38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.  
12:39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:  
12:40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.  

12:41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.  
12:42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.  
12:43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.  
12:44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.  
12:45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.  

12:46 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.  
12:47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.  
12:48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?  
12:49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
12:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

13:1 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.  
13:2 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.  
13:3 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;  
13:4 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:  
13:5 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:  

13:6 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.  
13:7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:  
13:8 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.  
13:9 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.  
13:10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?  

13:11 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.  
13:12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.  
13:13 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.  
13:14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:  
13:15 For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.  

13:16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.  
13:17 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.  
13:18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.  
13:19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.  
13:20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  

13:21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.  
13:22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.  
13:23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.  
13:24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:  
13:25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.  

13:26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.  
13:27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?  
13:28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  
13:29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.  
13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.  

13:31 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:  
13:32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.  
13:33 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.  
13:34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:  
13:35 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.  

13:36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.  
13:37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;  
13:38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;  
13:39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.  
13:40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.  

13:41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;  
13:42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  
13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.  
13:44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.  
13:45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:  

13:46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.  
13:47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:  
13:48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.  
13:49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,  
13:50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  

13:51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.  
13:52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.  
13:53 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.  
13:54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?  
13:55 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  

13:56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?  
13:57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.  
13:58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

14:1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,  
14:2 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.  
14:3 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.  
14:4 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.  
14:5 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.  

14:6 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.  
14:7 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.  
14:8 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.  
14:9 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.  
14:10 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.  

14:11 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.  
14:12 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.  
14:13 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.  
14:14 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.  
14:15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.  

14:16 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.  
14:17 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.  
14:18 He said, Bring them hither to me.  
14:19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  
14:20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.  

14:21 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.  
14:22 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.  
14:23 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.  
14:24 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.  
14:25 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.  

14:26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.  
14:27 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.  
14:28 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.  
14:29 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.  
14:30 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.  

14:31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?  
14:32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.  
14:33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.  
14:34 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.  
14:35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;  

14:36 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

Matthew Chapter 15  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39
15:1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,  
15:2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.  
15:3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?  
15:4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.  
15:5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;  

15:6 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.  
15:7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,  
15:8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.  
15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.  
15:10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:  

15:11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.  
15:12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?  
15:13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.  
15:14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.  
15:15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.  

15:16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?  
15:17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?  
15:18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.  
15:19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:  
15:20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.  

15:21 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.  
15:22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.  
15:23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.  
15:24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  
15:25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.  

15:26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.  
15:27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.  
15:28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.  
15:29 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.  
15:30 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:  

15:31 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.  
15:32 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.  
15:33 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?  
15:34 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.  
15:35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.  

15:36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  
15:37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.  
15:38 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.  
15:39 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.

Matthew Chapter 16  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28
16:1 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.  
16:2 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.  
16:3 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?  
16:4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.  
16:5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.  

16:6 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  
16:7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.  
16:8 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?  
16:9 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  
16:10 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  

16:11 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?  
16:12 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  
16:13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?  
16:14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.  
16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?  

16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.  
16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.  
16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
16:19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  
16:20 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.  

16:21 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.  
16:22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.  
16:23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.  
16:24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  
16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.  

16:26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  
16:27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.  
16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

Matthew Chapter 17  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27
17:1 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,  
17:2 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.  
17:3 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.  
17:4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.  
17:5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.  

17:6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.  
17:7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.  
17:8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.  
17:9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.  
17:10 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?  

17:11 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.  
17:12 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.  
17:13 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.  
17:14 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,  
17:15 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.  

17:16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.  
17:17 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.  
17:18 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.  
17:19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?  
17:20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.  

17:21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.  
17:22 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:  
17:23 And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.  
17:24 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?  
17:25 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?  

17:26 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.  
17:27 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.

Matthew Chapter 18  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35
18:1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?  
18:2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,  
18:3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  
18:4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  
18:5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.  

18:6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.  
18:7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
18:8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.  
18:9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  
18:10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.  

18:11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.  
18:12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  
18:13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.  
18:14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.  
18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  

18:16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  
18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  
18:18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  
18:19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  
18:20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.  

18:21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?  
18:22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.  
18:23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.  
18:24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.  
18:25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.  

18:26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  
18:27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.  
18:28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.  
18:29 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  
18:30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.  

18:31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.  
18:32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:  
18:33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?  
18:34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.  
18:35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

19:1 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;  
19:2 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.  
19:3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?  
19:4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,  
19:5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?  

19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.  
19:7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?  
19:8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.  
19:9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  
19:10 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.  

19:11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.  
19:12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.  
19:13 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.  
19:14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.  
19:15 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.  

19:16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?  
19:17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.  
19:18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,  
19:19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  
19:20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?  

19:21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.  
19:22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.  
19:23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.  
19:24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  
19:25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?  

19:26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.  
19:27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?  
19:28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  
19:29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.  
19:30 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.

Matthew Chapter 20  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34
20:1 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.  
20:2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.  
20:3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,  
20:4 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.  
20:5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.  

20:6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?  
20:7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.  
20:8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.  
20:9 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.  
20:10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.  

20:11 And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,  
20:12 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.  
20:13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?  
20:14 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.  
20:15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?  

20:16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.  
20:17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,  
20:18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,  
20:19 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.  
20:20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.  

20:21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.  
20:22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.  
20:23 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.  
20:24 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.  
20:25 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.  

20:26 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;  
20:27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:  
20:28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.  
20:29 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.  
20:30 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.  

20:31 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.  
20:32 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?  
20:33 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.  
20:34 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

Matthew Chapter 21  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46
21:1 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,  
21:2 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.  
21:3 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.  
21:4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,  
21:5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.  

21:6 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,  
21:7 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.  
21:8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.  
21:9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.  
21:10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?  

21:11 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.  
21:12 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,  
21:13 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.  
21:14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.  
21:15 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,  

21:16 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?  
21:17 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.  
21:18 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.  
21:19 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.  
21:20 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!

21:21 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.  
21:22 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.  
21:23 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?  
21:24 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.  
21:25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?  

21:26 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.  
21:27 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.  
21:28 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.  
21:29 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.  
21:30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.  

21:31 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.  
21:32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.  
21:33 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:  
21:34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.  
21:35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.  

21:36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.  
21:37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.  
21:38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.  
21:39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.  
21:40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?  

21:41 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.  
21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  
21:43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.  
21:44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.  
21:45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.  

21:46 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

Matthew Chapter 22  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46
22:1 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,  
22:2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,  
22:3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.  
22:4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.  
22:5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:  

22:6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.  
22:7 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.  
22:8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.  
22:9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.  
22:10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.  

22:11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:  
22:12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.  
22:13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  
22:14 For many are called, but few are chosen.  
22:15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.  

22:16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.  
22:17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?  
22:18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?  
22:19 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.  
22:20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?  

22:21 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.  
22:22 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.  
22:23 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,  
22:24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  
22:25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:  

22:26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.  
22:27 And last of all the woman died also.  
22:28 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.  
22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.  
22:30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.  

22:31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,  
22:32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.  
22:33 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.  
22:34 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.  
22:35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,  

22:36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?  
22:37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  
22:38 This is the first and great commandment.  
22:39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  
22:40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.  

22:41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,  
22:42 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.  
22:43 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,  
22:44 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?  
22:45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?  

22:46 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.

Matthew Chapter 23  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39
23:1 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,  
23:2 Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:  
23:3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.  
23:4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.  
23:5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,  

23:6 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,  
23:7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.  
23:8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.  
23:9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.  
23:10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.  

23:11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.  
23:12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.  
23:13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.  
23:14 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.  
23:15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.  

23:16 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
23:17 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?  
23:18 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.  
23:19 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?  
23:20 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.  

23:21 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.  
23:22 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.  
23:23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.  
23:24 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.  
23:25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.  

23:26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.  
23:27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.  
23:28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  
23:29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,  
23:30 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.  

23:31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.  
23:32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.  
23:33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?  
23:34 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:  
23:35 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.  

23:36 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.  
23:37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
23:38 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.  
23:39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

Matthew Chapter 24  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51
24:1 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.  
24:2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.  
24:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?  
24:4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.  
24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.  

24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.  
24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.  
24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.  
24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.  
24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.  

24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.  
24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.  
24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.  
24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.  
24:15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)

24:16 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:  
24:17 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:  
24:18 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.  
24:19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
24:20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:  

24:21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.  
24:22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.  
24:23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.  
24:24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.  
24:25 Behold, I have told you before.  

24:26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.  
24:27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  
24:28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.  
24:29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:  
24:30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  

24:31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.  
24:32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:  
24:33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.  
24:34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.  
24:35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.  

24:36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.  
24:37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  
24:38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,  
24:39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  
24:40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  

24:41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  
24:42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.  
24:43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.  
24:44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.  
24:45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?  

24:46 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.  
24:47 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.  
24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;  
24:49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;  
24:50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,  

24:51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

25:1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.  
25:2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.  
25:3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:  
25:4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.  
25:5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.  

25:6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.  
25:7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.  
25:8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.  
25:9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.  
25:10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.  

25:11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.  
25:12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.  
25:13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.  
25:14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.  
25:15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.  

25:16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.  
25:17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.  
25:18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.  
25:19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.  
25:20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.  

25:21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.  
25:22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.  
25:23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.  
25:24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:  
25:25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.  

25:26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:  
25:27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.  
25:28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.  
25:29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.  
25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  

25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:  
25:32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:  
25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.  
25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:  
25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:  

25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.  
25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  
25:38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?  
25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?  
25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.  

25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:  
25:42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:  
25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.  
25:44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?  
25:45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.  

25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

Matthew Chapter 26  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75
26:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,  
26:2 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.  
26:3 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,  
26:4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.  
26:5 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.  

26:6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,  
26:7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.  
26:8 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?  
26:9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.  
26:10 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.  

26:11 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.  
26:12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.  
26:13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.  
26:14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,  
26:15 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.  

26:16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.  
26:17 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?  
26:18 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.  
26:19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.  
26:20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.  

26:21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  
26:22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  
26:23 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.  
26:24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.  
26:25 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.  

26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.  
26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;  
26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.  
26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.  
26:30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  

26:31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.  
26:32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.  
26:33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.  
26:34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  
26:35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.  

26:36 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.  
26:37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.  
26:38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.  
26:39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.  
26:40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?  

26:41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.  
26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.  
26:43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.  
26:44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.  
26:45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  

26:46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.  
26:47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.  
26:48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.  
26:49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.  
26:50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.  

26:51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.  
26:52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.  
26:53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?  
26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  
26:55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.  

26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.  
26:57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.  
26:58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.  
26:59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;  
26:60 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,  

26:61 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.  
26:62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  
26:63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.  
26:64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  
26:65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.  

26:66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.  
26:67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,  
26:68 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?  
26:69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.  
26:70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.  

26:71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.  
26:72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.  
26:73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.  
26:74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.  
26:75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

Matthew Chapter 27  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66
27:1 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:  
27:2 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.  
27:3 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,  
27:4 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.  
27:5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.  

27:6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.  
27:7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.  
27:8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.  
27:9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;  
27:10 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.  

27:11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.  
27:12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.  
27:13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?  
27:14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.  
27:15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.  

27:16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.  
27:17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?  
27:18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.  
27:19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.  
27:20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.  

27:21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.  
27:22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.  
27:23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.  
27:24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.  
27:25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.  

27:26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.  
27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.  
27:28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.  
27:29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
27:30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.  

27:31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.  
27:32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.  
27:33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,  
27:34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.  
27:35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.  

27:36 And sitting down they watched him there;  
27:37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  
27:38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.  
27:39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,  
27:40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.  

27:41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,  
27:42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.  
27:43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.  
27:44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.  
27:45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.  

27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  
27:47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.  
27:48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.  
27:49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.  
27:50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.  

27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;  
27:52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,  
27:53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.  
27:54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.  
27:55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:  

27:56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.  
27:57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:  
27:58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.  
27:59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  
27:60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.  

27:61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.  
27:62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,  
27:63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.  
27:64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.  
27:65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.  

27:66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.

Matthew Chapter 28  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.  
28:2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.  
28:3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:  
28:4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.  
28:5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.  

28:6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.  
28:7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.  
28:8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.  
28:9 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.  
28:10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.  

28:11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.  
28:12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,  
28:13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.  
28:14 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.  
28:15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.  

28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.  
28:17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.  
28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.  
28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:  
28:20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

1:18 耶稣基督降生的事、记在下面。他母亲马利亚已经许配了约瑟、还没有迎娶、马利亚就从圣灵怀了孕。  
1:19 他丈夫约瑟是个义人、不愿意明明的羞辱他、想要暗暗的把他休了。  
1:20 正思念这事的时候、有主的使者向他梦中显现、说、大卫的子孙约瑟、不要怕、只管娶过你的妻子马利亚来。因他所怀的孕、是从圣灵来的。  

1:21 他将要生一个儿子。你要给他起名叫耶稣。因他要将自己的百姓从罪恶里救出来。  
1:22 这一切的事成就、是要应验主借先知所说的话、  
1:23 说、『必有童女、怀孕生子、人要称他的名为以马内利。』（以马内利翻出来、就是　神与我们同在。)  
1:24 约瑟醒了、起来、就遵着主使者的吩咐、把妻子娶过来。  
1:25 只是没有和他同房、等他生了儿子、〔有古卷作等他生了头胎的儿子〕就给他起名叫耶稣。  


------------------------------------------

马太福音 2章   

2:1 当希律王的时候、耶稣生在犹太的伯利恒。有几个博士从东方来到耶路撒冷、说、  
2:2 那生下来作犹太人之王的在那里。我们在东方看见他的星、特来拜他。  
2:3 希律王听见了、就心里不安。耶路撒冷合城的人、也都不安。  
2:4 他就召齐了祭司长和民间的文士、问他们说、基督当生在何处。  
2:5 他们回答说、在犹太的伯利恒。因为有先知记着说、  

2:6 『犹大地的伯利恒阿、你在犹大诸城中、并不是最小的。因为将来有一位君王、要从你那里出来、牧养我以色列民。』  
2:7 当下希律暗暗的召了博士来、细问那星是甚么时候出现的。  
2:8 就差他们往伯利恒去、说、你们去仔细寻访那小孩子。寻到了、就来报信、我也好去拜他。  
2:9 他们听见王的话、就去了。在东方所看见的那星、忽然在他们前头行、直行到小孩子的地方、就在上头停住了。  
2:10 他们看见那星、就大大的欢喜。  

2:11 进了房子、看见小孩子和他母亲马利亚、就俯伏拜那小孩子、揭开宝盒、拿黄金乳香没药为礼物献给他。  
2:12 博士因为在梦中被主指示、不要回去见希律、就从别的路回本地去了。  
2:13 他们去后、有主的使者向约瑟梦中显现、说、起来、带着小孩子同他母亲、逃往埃及、住在那里、等我吩咐你。因为希律必寻找小孩子要除灭他。  
2:14 约瑟就起来、夜间带着小孩子和他母亲往埃及去。  
2:15 住在那里、直到希律死了。这是要应验主借先知所说的话、说、『我从埃及召出我的儿子来。』  

2:16 希律见自己被博士愚弄、就大大发怒、差人将伯利恒城里、并四境所有的男孩、照着他向博士仔细查问的时候、凡两岁以里的、都杀尽了。  
2:17 这就应了先知耶利米的话、说、  
2:18 『在拉玛听见号咷大哭的声音、是拉结哭他儿女、不肯受安慰、因为他们都不在了。』  
2:19 希律死了以后、有主的使者、在埃及向约瑟梦中显现、说、  
2:20 起来、带着小孩子和他母亲往以色列地去。因为要害小孩子性命的人已经死了。  

2:21 约瑟就起来、把小孩子和他母亲带到以色列地去。  
2:22 只因听见亚基老接着他父亲希律作了犹太王、就怕往那里去。又在梦中被主指示、便往加利利境内去了。  
2:23 到了一座城、名叫拿撒勒、就住在那里。这是要应验先知所说、他将称为拿撒勒人的话了。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 3章  

3:1 那时、有施洗的约翰出来、在犹太的旷野传道、说、  
3:2 天国近了、你们应当悔改。  
3:3 这人就是先知以赛亚所说的、他说、『在旷野有人声喊着说、预备主的道、修直他的路。』  
3:4 这约翰身穿骆驼毛的衣服、腰束皮带、吃的是蝗虫野蜜。  
3:5 那时、耶路撒冷和犹太全地、并约但河一带地方的人、都出去到约翰那里。  

3:6 承认他们的罪、在约但河里受他的洗。  
3:7 约翰看见许多法利赛人和撒都该人、也来受洗、就对他们说、毒蛇的种类、谁指示你们逃避将来的忿怒呢。  
3:8 你们要结出果子来、与悔改的心相称。  
3:9 不要自己心里说、有亚伯拉罕为我们的祖宗。我告诉你们、　神能从这些石头中给亚伯拉罕兴起子孙来。  
3:10 现在斧子已经放在树根上、凡不结好果子的树、就砍下来、丢在火里。  

3:11 我是用水给你们施洗、叫你们悔改。但那在我以后来的、能力比我更大、我就是给他提鞋、也不配。他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。  
3:12 他手里拿着簸箕、要扬净他的场、把麦子收在仓里、把糠用不灭的火烧尽了。  
3:13 当下、耶稣从加利利来到约但河、见了约翰、要受他的洗。  
3:14 约翰想要拦住他、说、我当受你的洗、你反倒上我这里来么。  
3:15 耶稣回答说、你暂且许我。因为我们理当这样尽诸般的义。〔或作礼〕于是约翰许了他。  

3:16 耶稣受了洗、随即从水里上来。天忽然为他开了、他就看见　神的灵、彷彿鸽子降下、落在他身上。  
3:17 从天上有声音说、这是我的爱子、我所喜悦的。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 4章   

4:1 当时、耶稣被圣灵引到旷野、受魔鬼的试探。  
4:2 他禁食四十昼夜、后来就饿了。  
4:3 那试探人的进前来、对他说、你若是　神的儿子、可以吩咐这些石头变成食物。  
4:4 耶稣却回答说、经上记着说、『人活着、不是单靠食物、乃是靠　神口里所出的一切话。』  
4:5 魔鬼就带他进了圣城、叫他站在殿顶上、〔顶原文作翅〕

4:6 对他说、你若是　神的儿子、可以跳下去。因为经上记着说、『主要为你吩咐他的使者、用手托着你、免得你的脚碰在石头上。』  
4:7 耶稣对他说、经上又记着说、『不可试探主你的　神。』  
4:8 魔鬼又带他上了一座最高的山、将世上的万国、与万国的荣华、都指给他看、  
4:9 对他说、你若俯伏拜我、我就把这一切都赐给你。  
4:10 耶稣说、撒但退去吧。〔撒但就是抵挡的意思乃魔鬼的别名〕因为经上记着说、『当拜主你的　神、单要事奉他。』  

4:11 于是魔鬼离了耶稣、有天使来伺候他。  
4:12 耶稣听见约翰下了监、就退到加利利去。  
4:13 后又离开拿撒勒、往迦百农去、就住在那里。那地方靠海、在西布伦和拿弗他利的边界上。  
4:14 这是要应验先知以赛亚的话、  
4:15 说、『西布伦地、拿弗他利地、就是沿海的路、约但河外、外邦人的加利利地。  

4:16 那坐在黑暗里的百姓、看见了大光、坐在死荫之地的人、有光发现照着他们。』  
4:17 从那时候耶稣就传起道来、说、天国近了、你们应当悔改。  
4:18 耶稣在加利利海边行走、看见弟兄二人、就是那称呼彼得的西门、和他兄弟安得烈、在海里撒网。他们本是打鱼的。  
4:19 耶稣对他们说、来跟从我、我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。  
4:20 他们就立刻舍了网、跟从了他。  

4:21 从那里往前走、又看见弟兄二人、就是西庇太的儿子雅各、和他兄弟约翰、同他们的父亲西庇太在船上补网。耶稣就招呼他们。  
4:22 他们立刻舍了船、别了父亲、跟从了耶稣。  
4:23 耶稣走遍加利利、在各会堂里教训人、传天国的福音、医治百姓各样的病症。  
4:24 他的名声就传遍了叙利亚。那里的人把一切害病的、就是害各样疾病、各样疼痛的、和被鬼附的、癫痫的、瘫痪的、都带了来、耶稣就治好了他们。  
4:25 当下、有许多人从加利利、低加波利、耶路撒冷、犹太、约但河外、来跟着他。  


------------------------------------------

马太福音 5章   

5:1 耶稣看见这许多的人、就上了山、既已坐下、门徒到他跟前来。  
5:2 他就开口教训他们说、  
5:3 虚心的人有福了。因为天国是他们的。  
5:4 哀恸的人有福了。因为他们必得安慰。  
5:5 温柔的人有福了。因为他们必承受地土。  

5:6 饥渴慕义的人有福了。因为他们必得饱足。  
5:7 怜恤人的人有福了。因为他们必蒙怜恤。  
5:8 清心的人有福了。因为他们必得见　神。  
5:9 使人和睦的人有福了。因为他们必称为　神的儿子。  
5:10 为义受逼迫的人有福了。因为天国是他们的。  

5:11 人若因我辱骂你们、逼迫你们、捏造各样坏话毁谤你们、你们就有福了。  
5:12 应当欢喜快乐。因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的。在你们以前的先知、人也是这样逼迫他们。  
5:13 你们是世上的盐。盐若失了味、怎能叫他再咸呢。以后无用、不过丢在外面、被人践踏了。  
5:14 你们是世上的光。城造在山上、是不能隐藏的。  
5:15 人点灯、不放在斗底下、是放在灯台上、就照亮一家的人。  

5:16 你们的光也当这样照在人前、叫他们看见你们的好行为、便将荣耀归给你们在天上的父。  
5:17 莫想我来要废掉律法和先知。我来不是要废掉、乃是要成全。  
5:18 我实在告诉你们、就是到天地都废去了、律法的一点一画也不能废去、都要成全。  
5:19 所以无论何人废掉这诫命中最小的一条、又教训人这样作、他在天国要称为最小的。但无论何人遵行这诫命、又教训人遵行、他在天国要称为大的。  
5:20 我告诉你们、你们的义、若不胜于文士和法利赛人的义、断不能进天国。  

5:21 你们听见有吩咐古人的话、说、『不可杀人、』又说、『凡杀人的、难免受审判。』  
5:22 只是我告诉你们、凡向弟兄动怒的、难免受审判。〔有古卷在凡字下添无缘无故的五字〕凡骂弟兄是拉加的、难免公会的审断。凡骂弟兄是魔利的、难免地狱的火。  
5:23 所以你在祭坛上献礼物的时候、若想起弟兄向你怀怨、  
5:24 就把礼物留在坛前、先去同弟兄和好、然后来献礼物。  
5:25 你同告你的对头还在路上、就赶紧与他和息。恐怕他把你送给审判官、审判官交付衙役、你就下在监里了。  

5:26 我实在告诉你、若有一文钱没有还清、你断不能从那里出来。  
5:27 你们听见有话说、『不可奸淫。』  
5:28 只是我告诉你们、凡看见妇女就动淫念的、这人心里已经与他犯奸淫了。  
5:29 若是你的右眼叫你跌倒、就剜出来丢掉。宁可失去百体中的一体、不叫全身丢在地狱里。  
5:30 若是右手叫你跌倒、就砍下来丢掉。宁可失去百体中的一体、不叫全身下入地狱。  

5:31 又有话说、人若休妻、就当给他休书。  
5:32 只是我告诉你们、凡休妻的、若不是为淫乱的缘故、就是叫他作淫妇了。人若娶这被休的妇人、也是犯奸淫了。  
5:33 你们又听见有吩咐古人的话、说、『不可背誓、所起的誓、总要向主谨守。』  
5:34 只是我告诉你们、甚么誓都不可起、不可指着天起誓、因为天是　神的座位。  
5:35 不可指着地起誓、因为地是他的脚凳。也不可指着耶路撒冷起誓、因为耶路撒冷是大君的京城。  

5:36 又不可指着你的头起誓、因为你不能使一根头发变黑变白了。  
5:37 你们的话、是、就说是。不是、就说不是。若再多说、就是出于那恶者。〔或作是从恶里出来的〕
5:38 你们听见有话说、『以眼还眼、以牙还牙。』  
5:39 只是我告诉你们、不要与恶人作对。有人打你的右脸、连左脸也转过来由他打。  
5:40 有人想要告你、要拿你的里衣、连外衣也由他拿去。  

5:41 有人强逼你走一里路、你就同他走二里。  
5:42 有求你的、就给他。有向你借贷的、不可推辞。  
5:43 你们听见有话说、『当爱你的邻舍、恨你的仇敌。』  
5:44 只是我告诉你们、要爱你们的仇敌。为那逼迫你们的祷告。  
5:45 这样、就可以作你们天父的儿子。因为他叫日头照好人、也照歹人、降雨给义人、也给不义的人。  

5:46 你们若单爱那爱你们的人。有甚么赏赐呢。就是税吏不也是这样行么。  
5:47 你们若单请你弟兄的安、比人有甚么长处呢。就是外邦人不也是这样行么。  
5:48 所以你们要完全、像你们的天父完全一样。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 6章   

6:1 你们要小心、不可将善事行在人的面前、故意叫他们看见。若是这样、就不能得你们天父的赏赐了。  
6:2 所以你施舍的时候、不可在你前面吹号、像那假冒为善的人、在会堂里和街道上所行的、故意要得人的荣耀。我实在告诉你们、他们已经得了他们的赏赐。  
6:3 你施舍的时候、不要叫左手知道右手所作的。  
6:4 要叫你施舍的事行在暗中、你父在暗中察看、必然报答你。〔有古卷作必在明处报答你〕
6:5 你们祷告的时候、不可像那假冒为善的人、爱站在会堂里、和十字路口上祷告、故意叫人看见。我实在告诉你们、他们已经得了他们的赏赐。  

6:6 你祷告的时候、要进你的内屋、关上门、祷告你在暗中的父、你父在暗中察看、必然报答你。  
6:7 你们祷告、不可像外邦人、用许多重复话。他们以为话多了必蒙垂听。  
6:8 你们不可效法他们。因为你们没有祈求以先、你们所需用的、你们的父早已知道了。  
6:9 所以你们祷告、要这样说。我们在天上的父、愿人都尊你的名为圣。  
6:10 愿你的国降临。愿你的旨意行在地上、如同行在天上。  

6:11 我们日用的饮食、今日赐给我们。  
6:12 免我们的债、如同我们免了人的债。  
6:13 不叫我们遇见试探。救我们脱离凶恶。〔或作脱离恶者〕因为国度、权柄、荣耀、全是你的直到永远、阿们。〔有古卷无因为至阿们等字〕
6:14 你们饶恕人的过犯、你们的天父也必饶恕你们的过犯。  
6:15 你们不饶恕人的过犯、你们的天父也必不饶恕你们的过犯。  

6:16 你们禁食的时候、不可像那假冒为善的人、脸上带着愁容。因为他们把脸弄得难看、故意叫人看出他们是禁食。我实在告诉你们、他们已经得了他们的赏赐。  
6:17 你禁食的时候、要梳头洗脸、  
6:18 不叫人看出你禁食来、只叫你暗中的父看见。你父在暗中察看、必然报答你。  
6:19 不要为自己积攒财宝在地上、地上有虫子咬、能锈坏、也有贼挖窟窿来偷。  
6:20 只要积攒财宝在天上、天上没有虫子咬、不能锈坏、也没有贼挖窟窿来偷。  

6:21 因为你的财宝在那里、你的心也在那里。  
6:22 眼睛就是身上的灯。你的眼睛若瞭亮、全身就光明。  
6:23 你的眼睛若昏花、全身就黑暗。你里头的光若黑暗了、那黑暗是何等大呢。  
6:24 一个人不能事奉两个主。不是恶这个爱那个、就是重这个轻那个。你们不能又事奉　神、又事奉玛门。〔玛门是财利的意思〕
6:25 所以我告诉你们、不要为生命忧虑、吃甚么、喝甚么。为身体忧虑穿甚么。生命不胜于饮食么、身体不胜于衣裳么。  

6:26 你们看那天上的飞鸟、也不种、也不收、也不积蓄在仓里、你们的天父尚且养活他。你们不比飞鸟贵重得多么。  
6:27 你们那一个能用思虑、使寿数多加一刻呢。〔或作使身量多加一肘呢〕
6:28 何必为衣裳忧虑呢。你想野地里的百合花、怎么长起来、他也不劳苦、也不纺线。  
6:29 然而我告诉你们、就是所罗门极荣华的时候、他所穿戴的、还不如这花一朵呢。  
6:30 你们这小信的人哪、野地里的草、今天还在、明天就丢在炉里、　神还给他这样的妆饰、何况你们呢。  

6:31 所以不要忧虑、说、吃甚么、喝甚么、穿甚么。  
6:32 这都是外邦人所求的。你们需用的这一切东西、你们的天父是知道的。  
6:33 你们要先求他的国、和他的义这些东西都要加给你们了。  
6:34 所以不要为明天忧虑。因为明天自有明天的忧虑。一天的难处一天当就够了。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 7章    

7:1 你们不要论断人、免得你们被论断。  
7:2 因为你们怎样论断人、也必怎样被论断。你们用甚么量器量给人、也必用甚么量器量给你们。  
7:3 为甚么看见你弟兄眼中有刺、却不想自己眼中有梁木呢。  
7:4 你自己眼中有梁木、怎能对你弟兄说、容我去掉你眼中的刺呢。  
7:5 你这假冒为善的人、先去掉自己眼中的梁木、然后才能看得清楚、去掉你弟兄眼中的刺。  

7:6 不要把圣物给狗、也不要把你们的珍珠丢在猪前、恐怕他践踏了珍珠、转过来咬你们。  
7:7 你们祈求、就给你们。寻找、就寻见。叩门、就给你们开门。  
7:8 因为凡祈求的、就得着。寻找的、就寻见。叩门的、就给他开门。  
7:9 你们中间、谁有儿子求饼、反给他石头呢。  
7:10 求鱼、反给他蛇呢。  

7:11 你们虽然不好、尚且知道拿好东西给儿女、何况你们在天上的父、岂不更把好东西给求他的人么。  
7:12 所以无论何事、你们愿意人怎样待你们、你们也要怎样待人。因为这就是律法和先知的道理。  
7:13 你们要进窄门。因为引到灭亡、那门是宽的、路是大的、进去的人也多。  
7:14 引到永生、那门是窄的、路是小的、找着的人也少。  
7:15 你们要防备假先知。他们到你们这里来、外面披着羊皮、里面却是残暴的狼。  

7:16 凭着他们的果子、就可以认出他们来。荆棘上岂能摘葡萄呢。蒺藜里岂能摘无花果呢。  
7:17 这样、凡好树都结好果子、惟独坏树结坏果子。  
7:18 好树不能结坏果子、坏树不能结好果子。  
7:19 凡不结好果子的树、就砍下来、丢在火里。  
7:20 所以凭着他们的果子、就可以认出他们来。  

7:21 凡称呼我主阿、主阿的人、不能都进天国。惟独遵行我天父旨意的人、才能进去。  
7:22 当那日必有许多人对我说、主阿、主阿、我们不是奉你的名传道、奉你的名赶鬼、奉你的名行许多异能么。  
7:23 我就明明的告诉他们说、我从来不认识你们、你们这些作恶的人、离开我去吧。  
7:24 所以凡听见我这话就去行的、好比一个聪明人、把房子盖在磐石上。  
7:25 雨淋、水冲、风吹、撞着那房子、房子总不倒塌。因为根基立在磐石上。  

7:26 凡听见我这话不去行的、好比一个无知的人、把房子盖在沙土上。  
7:27 雨淋、水冲、风吹、撞着那房子、房子就倒塌了。并且倒塌得很大。  
7:28 耶稣讲完了这些话、众人都希奇他的教训。  
7:29 因为他教训他们、正像有权柄的人、不像他们的文士。

马太福音 8章   

8:1 耶稣下了山、有许多人跟着他。  
8:2 有一个长大痲疯的、来拜他说、主若肯、必能叫我洁净了。  
8:3 耶稣伸手摸他说、我肯、你洁净了吧。他的大痲疯立刻就洁净了。  
8:4 耶稣对他说、你切不可告诉人。只要去把身体给祭司察看、献上摩西所吩咐的礼物、对众人作证据。  
8:5 耶稣进了迦百农、有一个百夫长进前来、求他说、  

8:6 主阿、我的仆人害瘫痪病、躺在家里、甚是疼苦。  
8:7 耶稣说、我去医治他。  
8:8 百夫长回答说、主阿、你到我舍下、我不敢当。只要你说一句话、我的仆人就必好了。  
8:9 因为我在人的权下、也有兵在我以下。对这个说、去、他就去。对那个说、来、他就来。对我的仆人说、你作这事、他就去作。  
8:10 耶稣听见就希奇、对跟从的人说、我实在告诉你们、这么大的信心、就是在以色列中、我也没有遇见过。  

8:11 我又告诉你们、从东从西、将有许多人来、在天国里与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各、一同坐席。  
8:12 惟有本国的子民、竟被赶到外边黑暗里去。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。  
8:13 耶稣对百夫长说、你回去吧。照你的信心、给你成全了。那时、他的仆人就好了。  
8:14 耶稣到了彼得家里、见彼得的岳母害热病躺着。  
8:15 耶稣把他的手一摸、热就退了。他就起来服事耶稣。  

8:16 到了晚上、有人带着许多被鬼附的、来到耶稣跟前、他只用一句话、就把鬼都赶出去。并且治好了一切有病的人。  
8:17 这是要应验先知以赛亚的话、说、『他代替我们的软弱、担当我们的疾病。』  
8:18 耶稣见许多人围着他、就吩咐渡到那边去。  
8:19 有一个文士来、对他说、夫子、你无论往那里去、我要跟从你。  
8:20 耶稣说、狐狸有洞、天空的飞鸟有窝、人子却没有枕头的地方。  

8:21 又有一个门徒对耶稣说、主阿、容我先回去埋葬我的父亲。  
8:22 耶稣说、任凭死人埋葬他们的死人、你跟从我吧。  
8:23 耶稣上了船、门徒跟着他。  
8:24 海里忽然起了暴风、甚至船被波浪掩盖。耶稣却睡着了。  
8:25 门徒来叫醒了他、说、主阿、救我们、我们丧命啦。  

8:26 耶稣说、你们这小信的人哪、为甚么胆怯呢。于是起来、斥责风和海、风和海就大大的平静了。  
8:27 众人希奇说、这是怎样的人、连风和海也听从他了。  
8:28 耶稣既渡到那边去、来到加大拉人的地方、就有两个被鬼附的人、从坟茔里出来迎着他、极其凶猛、甚至没有人能从那条路上经过。  
8:29 他们喊着说、　神的儿子、我们与你有甚么相干。时候还没有到、你就上这里来叫我们受苦么。  
8:30 离他们很远、有一大群猪吃食。  

8:31 鬼就央求耶稣说、若把我们赶出去、就打发我们进入猪群吧。  
8:32 耶稣说、去吧。鬼就出来、进入猪群。全群忽然闯下山崖、投在海里淹死了。  
8:33 放猪的就逃跑进城、将这一切事、和被鬼附的人所遭遇的、都告诉人。  
8:34 合城的人、都出来迎见耶稣。既见了、就央求他离开他们的境界。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 9章   

9:1 耶稣上了船、渡过海、来到自己的城里。  
9:2 有人用褥子抬着一个瘫子、到耶稣跟前来。耶稣见他们的信心、就对瘫子说、小子、放心吧。你的罪赦了。  
9:3 有几个文士心里说、这个人说僭妄的话了。  
9:4 耶稣知道他们的心意、就说、你们为甚么心里怀着恶念呢。  
9:5 或说、你的罪赦了。或说、你起来行走。那一样容易呢。  

9:6 但要叫你们知道人子在地上有赦罪的权柄、就对瘫子说、起来、拿你的褥子回家去吧。  
9:7 那人就起来、回家去了。  
9:8 众人看见都惊奇、就归荣耀与　神。因为他将这样的权柄赐给人。  
9:9 耶稣从那里往前走、看见一个人名叫马太、坐在税关上、就对他说、你跟从我来。他就起来、跟从了耶稣。  
9:10 耶稣在屋里坐席的时候、有好些税吏和罪人来、与耶稣和他的门徒一同坐席。  

9:11 法利赛人看见、就对耶稣的门徒说、你们的先生为甚么和税吏并罪人一同吃饭呢。  
9:12 耶稣听见、就说、康健的人用不着医生、有病的人才用得着。  
9:13 经上说、『我喜爱怜恤、不喜爱祭祀。』这句话的意思、你们且去揣摩。我来、本不是召义人、乃是召罪人。  
9:14 那时、约翰的门徒来见耶稣说、我们和法利赛人常常禁食、你的门徒倒不禁食、这是为甚么呢。  
9:15 耶稣对他们说、新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候、陪伴之人岂能哀恸呢。但日子将到、新郎要离开他们、那时候他们就要禁食。  

9:16 没有人把新布补在旧衣服上。因为所补上的、反带坏了那衣服、破的就更大了。  
9:17 也没有人把新酒装在旧皮袋里。若是这样、皮袋就裂开、酒漏出来、连皮袋也坏了。惟独把新酒装在新皮袋里、两样就都保全了。  
9:18 耶稣说这话的时候、有一个管会堂的来拜他说、我女儿刚才死了、求你去按手在他身上、他就必活了。  
9:19 耶稣便起来、跟着他去、门徒也跟了去。  
9:20 有一个女人、患了十二年的血漏、来到耶稣背后、摸他的衣裳繸子。  

9:21 因为他心里说、我只摸他的衣裳、就必痊癒。  
9:22 耶稣转过来看见他、就说、女儿、放心、你的信救了你。从那时候、女人就痊癒了。  
9:23 耶稣到了管会堂的家里、看见有吹手、又有许多人乱嚷。  
9:24 就说、退去吧。这闺女不是死了、是睡着了。他们就嗤笑他。  
9:25 众人既被撵出、耶稣就进去、拉着闺女的手、闺女便起来了。  

9:26 于是这风声传遍了那地方。  
9:27 耶稣从那里往前走、有两个瞎子跟着他、喊叫说、大卫的子孙、可怜我们吧。  
9:28 耶稣进了房子、瞎子就来到他跟前。耶稣说、你们信我能作这事么。他们说、主阿、我们信。  
9:29 耶稣就摸他们的眼睛、说、照着你们的信给你们成全了吧。  
9:30 他们的眼睛就开了。耶稣切切的嘱咐他们说、你们要小心、不可叫人知道。  

9:31 他们出去、竟把他的名声传遍了那地方。  
9:32 他们出去的时候、有人将鬼所附的一个哑巴、带到耶稣跟前来。  
9:33 鬼被赶出去、哑巴就说出话来。众人都希奇说、在以色列中、从来没有见过这样的事。  
9:34 法利赛人却说、他是靠着鬼王赶鬼。  
9:35 耶稣走遍各城各乡、在会堂里教训人、宣讲天国的福音、又医治各样的病症。  

9:36 他看见许多的人、就怜悯他们。因为他们困苦流离、如同羊没有牧人一般。  
9:37 于是对门徒说、要收的庄稼多、作工的人少。  
9:38 所以你们当求庄稼的主、打发工人出去、收他的庄稼。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 10章   

10:1 耶稣叫了十二个门徒来、给他们权柄、能赶逐污鬼、并医治各样的病症。  
10:2 这十二使徒的名、头一个叫西门、又称彼得、还有他兄弟安得烈。西庇太的儿子雅各、和雅各的兄弟约翰。  
10:3 腓力、和巴多罗买、多马、和税吏马太、亚勒腓的儿子雅各、和达太。  
10:4 奋锐党的西门、还有卖耶稣的加略人犹大。  
10:5 耶稣差这十二个人去、吩咐他们说、外邦人的路、你们不要走。撒玛利亚人的城、你们不要进。  

10:6 宁可往以色列家迷失的羊那里去。  
10:7 随走随传、说、天国近了。  
10:8 医治病人、叫死人复活、叫长大痲疯的洁净、把鬼赶出去。你们白白的得来、也要白白的舍去。  
10:9 腰袋里、不要带金银铜钱。  
10:10 行路不要带口袋、不要带两件褂子、也不要带鞋和拐杖。因为工人得饮食、是应当的。  

10:11 你们无论进那一城、那一村、要打听那里谁是好人、就住在他家、直住到走的时候。  
10:12 进他家里去、要请他的安。  
10:13 那家若配得平安、你们所求的平安、就必临到那家。若不配得、你们所求的平安仍归你们。  
10:14 凡不接待你们、不听你们话的人、你们离开那家、或是那城的时候、就把脚上的尘土跺下去。  
10:15 我实在告诉你们、当审判的日子、所多玛和蛾摩拉所受的、比那城还容易受呢。  

10:16 我差你们去、如同羊进入狼群、所以你们要灵巧像蛇、驯良像鸽子。  
10:17 你们要防备人。因为他们要把你们交给公会、也要在会堂里鞭打你们。  
10:18 并且你们要为我的缘故、被送到诸侯君王面前、对他们和外邦人作见证。  
10:19 你们被交的时候、不要思虑怎样说话、或说甚么话。到那时候、必赐给你们当说的话。  
10:20 因为不是你们自己说的、乃是你们父的灵在你们里头说的。  

10:21 弟兄要把弟兄、父亲要把儿子、送到死地。儿女要与父母为敌、害死他们。  
10:22 并且你们要为我的名、被众人恨恶、惟有忍耐到底的、必然得救。  
10:23 有人在这城里逼迫你们、就逃到那城里去。我实在告诉你们、以色列的城邑、你们还没有走遍、人子就到了。  
10:24 学生不能高过先生、仆人不能高过主人。  
10:25 学生和先生一样、仆人和主人一样、也就罢了。人既骂家主是别西卜、何况他的家人呢。〔别西卜是鬼王的名〕

10:26 所以不要怕他们。因为掩盖的事、没有不露出来的。隐藏的事、没有不被人知道的。  
10:27 我在暗中告诉你们的、你们要在明处说出来。你们耳中所听的、要在房上宣扬出来。  
10:28 那杀身体不能杀灵魂的、不要怕他们。惟有能把身体和灵魂都灭在地狱里的、正要怕他。  
10:29 两个麻雀、不是卖一分银子么。若是你们的父不许、一个也不能掉在地上。  
10:30 就是你们的头发、也都被数过了。  

10:31 所以不要惧怕。你们比许多麻雀还贵重。  
10:32 凡在人面前认我的、我在我天上的父面前、也必认他。  
10:33 凡在人面前不认我的、我在我天上的父面前、也必不认他。  
10:34 你们不要想我来、是叫地上太平。我来、并不是叫地上太平、乃是叫地上动刀兵。  
10:35 因为我来、是叫人与父亲生疏、女儿与母亲生疏、媳妇与婆婆生疏。  

10:36 人的仇敌、就是自己家里的人。  
10:37 爱父母过于爱我的、不配作我的门徒、爱儿女过于爱我的、不配作我的门徒。  
10:38 不背着他的十字架跟从我的、也不配作我的门徒。  
10:39 得着生命的、将要失丧生命。为我失丧生命的、将要得着生命。  
10:40 人接待你们、就是接待我。接待我、就是接待那差我来的。  

10:41 人因为先知的名接待先知、必得先知所得的赏赐、人因为义人的名接待义人、必得义人所得的赏赐。  
10:42 无论何人、因为门徒的名、只把一杯凉水给这小子里的一个喝、我实在告诉你们、这人不能不得赏赐。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 11章   

11:1 耶稣吩咐完了十二个门徒、就离开那里、往各城去传道教训人。  
11:2 约翰在监里听见基督所作的事、就打发两个门徒去、  
11:3 问他说、那将要来的是你么、还是我们等候别人呢。  
11:4 耶稣回答说、你们去把所听见所看见的事告诉约翰。  
11:5 就是瞎子看见、瘸子行走、长大痲疯的洁净、聋子听见、死人复活、穷人有福音传给他们。  

11:6 凡不因我跌倒的、就有福了。  
11:7 他们走的时候、耶稣就对众人讲论约翰说、你们从前出到旷野、是要看甚么呢、要看风吹动的芦苇么。  
11:8 你们出去、到底是要看甚么、要看穿细软衣服的人么、那穿细软衣服的人、是在王宫里。  
11:9 你们出去、究竟是为甚么、是要看先知么。我告诉你们、是的、他比先知大多了。  
11:10 经上记着说、『我要差遣我的使者在你前面、预备道路。』所说的就是这个人。  

11:11 我实在告诉你们、凡妇人所生的、没有一个兴起来大过施洗约翰的。然而天国里最小的、比他还大。  
11:12 从施洗约翰的时候到如今、天国是努力进入的、努力的人就得着了。  
11:13 因为众先知和律法说预言、到约翰为止。  
11:14 你们若肯领受、这人就是那应当来的以利亚。  
11:15 有耳可听的、就应当听。  

11:16 我可用甚么比这世代呢。好像孩童坐在街市上、招呼同伴、说、  
11:17 我们向你们吹笛、你们不跳舞。我们向你们举哀、你们不捶胸。  
11:18 约翰来了、也不吃、也不喝、人就说他是被鬼附着的。  
11:19 人子来了、也吃、也喝、人又说他是贪食好酒的人、是税吏和罪人的朋友。但智慧之子、总以智慧为是。〔有古卷作但智慧在行为上就显为是〕
11:20 耶稣在诸城中行了许多异能、那些城的人终不悔改、就在那时候责备他们说、  

11:21 哥拉汛哪、你有祸了、伯赛大阿、你有祸了、因为在你们中间所行的异能、若行在推罗西顿、他们早已披麻蒙灰悔改了。  
11:22 但我告诉你们、当审判的日子、推罗西顿所受的、比你们还容易受呢。  
11:23 迦百农阿你已经升到天上。〔或作你将要升到天上么〕将来必坠落阴间。因为在你那里所行的异能、若行在所多玛、他还可以存到今日。  
11:24 但我告诉你们、当审判的日子、所多玛所受的、比你还容易受呢。  
11:25 那时、耶稣说、父阿、天地的主、我感谢你、因为你将这些事、向聪明通达人、就藏起来、向婴孩、就显出来。  

11:26 父阿、是的、因为你的美意本是如此。  
11:27 一切所有的、都是我父交付我的。除了父、没有人知道子。除了子和子所愿意指示的、没有人知道父。  
11:28 凡劳苦担重担的人、可以到我这里来、我就使你们得安息。  
11:29 我心里柔和谦卑、你们当负我的轭、学我的样式、这样、你们心里就必得享安息。  
11:30 因为我的轭是容易的、我的担子是轻省的。  


------------------------------------------

马太福音 12章   

12:1 那时、耶稣在安息日、从麦地经过。他的门徒饿了、就掐起麦穗来吃。  
12:2 法利赛人看见、就对耶稣说、看哪、你的门徒作安息日不可作的事了。  
12:3 耶稣对他们说、经上记着、大卫和跟从他的人饥饿之时所作的事、你们没有念过么。  
12:4 他怎么进了　神的殿、吃了陈设饼、这饼不是他和跟从他的人可以吃得、惟独祭司才可以吃。  
12:5 再者、律法上所记的、当安息日、祭司在殿里犯了安息日、还是没有罪、你们没有念过么。  

12:6 但我告诉你们、在这里有一人比殿更大。  
12:7 『我喜爱怜恤、不喜爱祭祀。』你们若明白这话的意思、就不将无罪的、当作有罪的了。  
12:8 因为人子是安息日的主。  
12:9 耶稣离开那地方、进了一个会堂。  
12:10 那里有一个人枯干了一只手。有人问耶稣说、安息日治病、可以不可以。意思是要控告他。  

12:11 耶稣说、你们中间谁有一只羊、当安息日掉在坑里、不把他抓住拉上来呢。  
12:12 人比羊何等贵重呢。所以在安息日作善事是可以的。  
12:13 于是对那人说、伸出手来。他把手一伸、手就复了原、和那只手一样。  
12:14 法利赛人出去、商议怎样可以除灭耶稣。  
12:15 耶稣知道了、就离开那里、有许多人跟着他、他把其中有病的人都治好了。  

12:16 又嘱咐他们、不要给他传名。  
12:17 这是要应验先知以赛亚的话、说、  
12:18 『看哪、我的仆人、我所拣选、所亲爱、心里所喜悦的、我要将我的灵赐给他、他必将公理传给外邦。  
12:19 他不争竞、不喧嚷。街上也没有人听见他的声音。  
12:20 压伤的芦苇、他不折断。将残的灯火、他不吹灭。等他施行公理、叫公理得胜。  

12:21 外邦人都要仰望他的名。』  
12:22 当下有人将一个被鬼附着、又瞎又哑的人、带到耶稣那里。耶稣就医治他、甚至那哑巴又能说话、又能看见。  
12:23 众人都惊奇、说、这不是大卫的子孙么。  
12:24 但法利赛人听见、就说、这个人赶鬼、无非是靠着鬼王别西卜阿。  
12:25 耶稣知道他们的意念、就对他们说、凡一国自相分争、就成为荒场、一城一家自相分争、必站立不住。  

12:26 若撒但赶逐撒但、就是自相分争、他的国怎能站得住呢。  
12:27 我若靠着别西卜赶鬼、你们的子弟赶鬼、又靠着谁呢。这样、他们就要断定你们的是非。  
12:28 我若靠着　神的灵赶鬼、这就是　神的国临到你们了。  
12:29 人怎能进壮士家里、抢夺他的家具呢、除非先捆住那壮士、才可以抢夺他的家财。  
12:30 不与我相合的、就是敌我的、不同我收聚的、就是分散的。  

12:31 所以我告诉你们、人一切的罪、和亵渎的话、都可得赦免。惟独亵渎圣灵、总不得赦免。  
12:32 凡说话干犯人子的、还可得赦免。惟独说话干犯圣灵的、今世来世总不得赦免。  
12:33 你们或以为树好、果子也好。树坏、果子也坏。因为看果子、就可以知道树。  
12:34 毒蛇的种类、你们既是恶人、怎能说出好话来呢。因为心里所充满的、口里就说出来。  
12:35 善人从他心里所存的善、就发出善来。恶人从他心里所存的恶、就发出恶来。  

12:36 我又告诉你们、凡人所说的闲话、当审判的日子、必要句句供出来。  
12:37 因为要凭你的话、定你为义、也要凭你的话、定你有罪。  
12:38 当时有几个文士和法利赛人、对耶稣说、夫子、我们愿意你显个神迹给我们看。  
12:39 耶稣回答说、一个邪恶淫乱的世代求看神迹。除了先知约拿的神迹以外、再没有神迹给他们看。  
12:40 约拿三日三夜在大鱼肚腹中。人子也要这样三日三夜在地里头。  

12:41 当审判的时候、尼尼微人、要起来定这世代的罪、因为尼尼微人听了约拿所传的、就悔改了。看哪、在这里有一人比约拿更大。  
12:42 当审判的时候、南方的女王、要起来定这世代的罪、因为他从地极而来、要听所罗门的智慧话。看哪、在这里有一人比所罗门更大。  
12:43 污鬼离了人身、就在无水之地、过来过去、寻求安歇之处、却寻不着。  
12:44 于是说、我要回到我所出来的屋里去。到了、就看见里面空闲、打扫干净、修饰好了。  
12:45 便去另带了七个比自己更恶的鬼来、都进去住在那里。那人末后的景况、比先前更不好了。这邪恶的世代、也要如此。  

12:46 耶稣还对众人说话的时候、不料、他母亲和他弟兄站在外边、要与他说话。  
12:47 有人告诉他说、看哪、你母亲和你弟兄站在外边、要与你说话。  
12:48 他却回答那人说、谁是我的母亲。谁是我的弟兄。  
12:49 就伸手指着门徒说、看哪、我的母亲、我的弟兄。  
12:50 凡遵行我天父旨意的人、就是我的弟兄姐妹和母亲了。  


------------------------------------------

马太福音 13章   

13:1 当那一天、耶稣从房子里出来、坐在海边。  
13:2 有许多人到他那里聚集、他只得上船坐下。众人都站在岸上。  
13:3 他用比喻对他们讲许多道理、说、有一个撒种的出去撒种。  
13:4 撒的时候、有落在路旁的、飞鸟来吃尽了。  
13:5 有落在土浅石头地上的。土既不深、发苗最快。  

13:6 日头出来一晒、因为没有根、就枯干了。  
13:7 有落在荆棘里的。荆棘长起来、把他挤住了。  
13:8 又有落在好土里的、就结实、有一百倍的、有六十倍的、有三十倍的。  
13:9 有耳可听的、就应当听。  
13:10 门徒进前来、问耶稣说、对众人讲话、为甚么用比喻呢。  

13:11 耶稣回答说、因为天国的奥秘、只叫你们知道、不叫他们知道。  
13:12 凡有的、还要加给他、叫他有余。凡没有的、连他所有的、也要夺去。  
13:13 所以我用比喻对他们讲、是因他们看也看不见、听也听不见、也不明白。  
13:14 在他们身上、正应了以赛亚的预言、说、『你们听是要听见、却不明白。看是要看见、却不晓得。』  
13:15 因为这百姓油蒙了心、耳朵发沉、眼睛闭着。恐怕眼睛看见、耳朵听见、心里明白、回转过来、我就医治他们。  

13:16 但你们的眼睛是有福的、因为看见了你们的耳朵也是有福的、因为听见了。  
13:17 我实在告诉你们、从前有许多先知和义人、要看你们所看的、却没有看见。要听你们所听的、却没有听见。  
13:18 所以你们当听这撒种的比喻。  
13:19 凡听见天国道理不明白的、那恶者就来、把所撒在他心里的、夺了去。这就是撒在路旁的了。  
13:20 撒在石头地上的、就是人听了道、当下欢喜领受。  

13:21 只因心里没有根、不过是暂时的。及至为道遭了患难、或是受了逼迫、立刻就跌倒了。  
13:22 撒在荆棘里的、就是人听了道、后来有世上的思虑、钱财的迷惑、把道挤住了、不能结实。  
13:23 撒在好地上的、就是人听道明白了、后来结实、有一百倍的、有六十倍的、有三十倍的。  
13:24 耶稣又设个比喻对他们说、天国好像人撒好种在田里。  
13:25 及至人睡觉的时候、有仇敌来、将稗子撒在麦子里、就走了。  

13:26 到长苗吐穗的时候、稗子也显出来。  
13:27 田主的仆人来告诉他说、主阿、你不是撒好种在田里么、从那里来的稗子呢。  
13:28 主人说、这是仇敌作的。仆人说、你要我们去薅出来么。  
13:29 主人说、不必、恐怕薅稗子、连麦子也拔出来。  
13:30 容这两样一齐长、等着收割。当收割的时候、我要对收割的人说、先将稗子薅出来、捆成捆、留着烧。惟有麦子、要收在仓里。  

13:31 他又设个比喻对他们说、天国好像一粒芥菜种、有人拿去种在田里。  
13:32 这原是百种里最小的。等到长起来、却比各样的菜都大、且成了树、天上的飞鸟来宿在他的枝上。  
13:33 他又对他们讲个比喻说、天国好像面酵、有妇人拿来、藏在三斗面里、直等全团都发起来。  
13:34 这都是耶稣用比喻对众人说的话。若不用比喻、就不对他们说甚么。  
13:35 这是要应验先知的话、说、『我要开口用比喻、把创世以来所隐藏的事发明出来。』  

13:36 当下耶稣离开众人、进了房子。他的门徒进前来说、请把田间稗子的比喻、讲给我们听。  
13:37 他回答说、那撒好种的、就是人子。  
13:38 田地、就是世界。好种、就是天国之子。稗子、就是那恶者之子。  
13:39 撒稗子的仇敌、就是魔鬼。收割的时候就、是世界的末了。收割的人就、是天使。  
13:40 将稗子薅出来、用火焚烧。世界的末了、也要如此。  

13:41 人子要差遣使者、把一切叫人跌倒的、和作恶的、从他国里挑出来、  
13:42 丢在火炉里。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。  
13:43 那时义人在他们父的国里、要发出光来、像太阳一样。有耳可听的、就应当听。  
13:44 天国好像宝贝藏在地里。人遇见了、就把他藏起来。欢欢喜喜的去变卖一切所有的、买这块地。  
13:45 天国又好像买卖人、寻找好珠子。  

13:46 遇见一颗重价的珠子、就去变卖他一切所有的、买了这颗珠子。  
13:47 天国又好像网撒在海里、聚拢各样水族。  
13:48 网既满了、人就拉上岸来坐下、拣好的收在器具里、将不好的丢弃了。  
13:49 世界的末了、也要这样。天使要出来从义人中、把恶人分别出来、  
13:50 丢在火炉里。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。  

13:51 耶稣说、这一切的话你们都明白了么。他们说、我们明白了、  
13:52 他说。凡文士受教作天国的门徒、就像一个家主、从他库里拿出新旧的东西来。  
13:53 耶稣说完了这些比喻、就离开那里、  
13:54 来到自己的家乡、在会堂里教训人、甚至他们都希奇、说、这人从那里有这等智慧、和异能呢。  
13:55 这不是木匠的儿子么。他母亲不是叫马利亚么。他弟兄们不是叫雅各、约西、〔有古卷作约瑟〕西门、犹大么。  

13:56 他妹妹们不是都在我们这里么。这人从那里有这一切的事呢。  
13:57 他们就厌弃他。〔厌弃他原文作因他跌倒〕耶稣对他们说、大凡先知、除了本地本家之外、没有不被人尊敬的。  
13:58 耶稣因为他们不信、就在那里不多行异能了。

马太福音 14章   

14:1 那时分封的王希律、听见耶稣的名声、  
14:2 就对臣仆说、这是施洗的约翰从死里复活、所以这些异能从他里面发出来。  
14:3 起先希律为他兄弟腓力的妻子希罗底的缘故、把约翰拿住锁在监里。  
14:4 因为约翰曾对他说、你娶这妇人是不合理的。  
14:5 希律就想要杀他、只是怕百姓。因为他们以约翰为先知。  

14:6 到了希律的生日、希罗底的女儿、在众人面前跳舞、使希律欢喜。  
14:7 希律就起誓、应许随他所求的给他。  
14:8 女儿被母亲所使、就说、请把施洗约翰的头、放在盘子里、拿来给我。  
14:9 王便忧愁、但因他所起的誓、又因同席的人、就吩咐给他。  
14:10 于是打发人去、在监里斩了约翰。  

14:11 把头放在盘子里、拿来给了女子。女子拿去给他母亲。  
14:12 约翰的门徒来、把尸首领去、埋葬了。就去告诉耶稣。  
14:13 耶稣听见了、就上船从那里独自退到野地里去。众人听见、就从各城里步行跟随他。  
14:14 耶稣出来、见有许多的人、就怜悯他们、治好了他们的病人。  
14:15 天将晚的时候、门徒进前来说、这是野地、时候已经过了。请叫众人散开、他们好往村子里去、自己买吃的。  

14:16 耶稣说、不用他们去、你们给他们吃吧。  
14:17 门徒说、我们这里只有五个饼、两条鱼。  
14:18 耶稣说、拿过来给我。  
14:19 于是吩咐众人坐在草地上。就拿着这五个饼、两条鱼、望着天、祝福、擘开饼、递给门徒。门徒又递给众人。  
14:20 他们都吃、并且吃饱了。把剩下的零碎收拾起来、装满了十二个篮子。  

14:21 吃的人除了妇女孩子、约有五千。  
14:22 耶稣随即催门徒上船、先渡到那边去、等他叫众人散开。  
14:23 散了众人以后、他就独自上山去祷告。到了晚上、只有他一人在那里。  
14:24 那时船在海中、因风不顺、被浪摇撼。  
14:25 夜里四更天、耶稣在海面上走、往门徒那里去。  

14:26 门徒看见他在海面上走、就惊慌了、说、是个鬼怪。便害怕、喊叫起来。  
14:27 耶稣连忙对他们说、你们放心。是我、不要怕。  
14:28 彼得说、主、如果是你、请叫我从水面上走到你那里去。  
14:29 耶稣说、你来吧。彼得就从船上下去、在水面上走、要到耶稣那里去。  
14:30 只因见风甚大、就害怕。将要沉下去、便喊着说、主阿、救我。  

14:31 耶稣赶紧伸手拉住他、说、你这小信的人哪、为甚么疑惑呢。  
14:32 他们上了船、风就住了。  
14:33 在船上的人都拜他说、你真是　神的儿子了。  
14:34 他们过了海、来到革尼撒勒地方。  
14:35 那里的人、一认出是耶稣、就打发人到周围地方去、把所有的病人、带到他那里。  

14:36 只求耶稣准他们摸他的衣裳繸子、摸着的人、就都好了。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 15章   

15:1 那时有法利赛人和文士、从耶路撒冷来见耶稣说、  
15:2 你的门徒为甚么犯古人的遗传呢。因为吃饭的时候、他们不洗手。  
15:3 耶稣回答说、你们为甚么因着你们的遗传、犯　神的诫命呢。  
15:4 　神说、当孝敬父母。又说、咒骂父母的、必治死他。  
15:5 你们倒说、无论何人对父母说、我所当奉给你的、已经作了供献。  

15:6 他就可以不孝敬父母。这就是你们借着遗传、废了　神的诫命。  
15:7 假冒为善的人哪、以赛亚指着你们说的预言、是不错的。他说、  
15:8 『这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我、心却远离我。  
15:9 他们将人的吩咐、当作道理教导人、所以拜我也是枉然。』  
15:10 耶稣就叫了众人来、对他们说、你们要听、也要明白。  

15:11 入口的不能污秽人、出口的乃能污秽人。  
15:12 当时、门徒进前来对他说、法利赛人听见这话、不服、你知道么。〔不服原文作跌倒〕
15:13 耶稣回答说、凡栽种的物、若不是我天父栽种的、必要拔出来。  
15:14 任凭他们吧。他们是瞎眼领路的。若是瞎子领瞎子、两个人都要掉在坑里。  
15:15 彼得对耶稣说、请将这比喻讲给我们听。  

15:16 耶稣说、你们到如今还不明白么。  
15:17 岂不知凡入口的、是运到肚子里、又落在茅厕里么。  
15:18 惟独出口的、是从心里发出来的、这才污秽人。  
15:19 因为从心里发出来的、有恶念、凶杀、奸淫、苟合、偷盗、妄证、谤讟。  
15:20 这都是污秽人的。至于不洗手吃饭、那却不污秽人。  

15:21 耶稣离开那里、退到推罗西顿的境内去。  
15:22 有一个迦南妇人、从那地方出来、喊着说、主阿、大卫的子孙、可怜我。我女儿被鬼附得甚苦。  
15:23 耶稣却一言不答。门徒进前来、求他说、这妇人在我们后头喊叫。请打发他走吧。  
15:24 耶稣说、我奉差遣、不过是到以色列家迷失的羊那里去。  
15:25 那妇人来拜他、说、主阿、帮助我。  

15:26 他回答说、不好拿儿女的饼、丢给狗吃。  
15:27 妇人说、主阿、不错。但是狗也吃他主人桌子上掉下来的碎渣儿。  
15:28 耶稣说、妇人、你的信心是大的。照你所要的、给你成全了吧。从那时候、他女儿就好了。  
15:29 耶稣离开那地方、来到靠近加利利的海边、就上山坐下。  
15:30 有许多人到他那里、带着瘸子、瞎子、哑巴、有残疾的、和好些别的病人、都放在他脚前。他就治好了他们。  

15:31 甚至众人都希奇。因为看见哑巴说话残疾的痊癒、瘸子行走、瞎子看见、他们就归荣耀给以色列的　神。  
15:32 耶稣叫门徒来说、我怜悯这众人、因为他们同我在这里已经三天、也没有吃的了。我不愿意叫他们饿着回去、恐怕在路上困乏。  
15:33 门徒说、我们在这野地、那里有这么多的饼、叫这许多人吃饱呢。  
15:34 耶稣说、你们有多少饼。他们说、有七个、还有几条小鱼。  
15:35 他就吩咐众人坐在地上。  

15:36 拿着这七个饼和几条鱼、祝谢了、擘开、递给门徒。门徒又递给众人。  
15:37 众人都吃、并且吃饱了、收拾剩下的零碎、装满了七个筐子。  
15:38 吃的人、除了妇女孩子、共有四千。  
15:39 耶稣叫众人散去、就上船、来到马加丹的境界。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 16章    

16:1 法利赛人和撒都该人、来试探耶稣、请他从天上显个神迹给他们看。  
16:2 耶稣回答说、晚上天发红、你们就说、天必要晴。  
16:3 早晨天发红、又发黑、你们就说、今日必有风雨。你们知道分辨天上的气色、倒不能分辨这时候的神迹。  
16:4 一个邪恶淫乱的世代求神迹、除了约拿的神迹以外、再没有神迹给他看。耶稣就离开他们去了。  
16:5 门徒渡到那边去、忘了带饼。  

16:6 耶稣对他们说、你们要谨慎、防备法利赛人和撒都该人的酵。  
16:7 门徒彼此议论说、这是因为我们没有带饼吧。  
16:8 耶稣看出来、就说、你们这小信的人、为甚么因为没有饼彼此议论呢。  
16:9 你们还不明白么、不记得那五个饼、分给五千人、又收拾了多少篮子的零碎么。  
16:10 也不记得那七个饼、分给四千人、又收拾了多少筐子的零碎么。  

16:11 我对你们说、要防备法利赛人和撒都该人的酵、这话不是指着饼说的。你们怎么不明白呢。  
16:12 门徒这才晓得他说的、不是叫他们防备饼的酵、乃是防备法利赛人和撒都该人的教训。  
16:13 耶稣到了该撒利亚腓立比的境内、就问门徒说、人说我人子是谁。〔有古卷无我字〕
16:14 他们说、有人说是施洗的约翰。有人说是以利亚。又有人说是耶利米、或是先知里的一位。  
16:15 耶稣说、你们说我是谁。  

16:16 西门彼得回答说、你是基督、是永生　神的儿子。  
16:17 耶稣对他说、西门巴约拿、你是有福的。因为这不是属血肉的指示你的、乃是我在天上的父指示的。  
16:18 我还告诉你、你是彼得、我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上。阴间的权柄、不能胜过他。〔权柄原文作门〕
16:19 我要把天国的钥匙给你。凡你在地上所捆绑的、在天上也要捆绑。凡你在地上所释放的、在天上也要释放。  
16:20 当下、耶稣嘱咐门徒、不可对人说他是基督。  

16:21 从此耶稣才指示门徒、他必须上耶路撒冷去、受长老祭司长文士许多的苦、并且被杀、第三日复活。  
16:22 彼得就拉着他、劝他说、主阿、万不可如此、这事必不临到你身上。  
16:23 耶稣转过来、对彼得说、撒但退我后边去吧。你是绊我脚的。因为你不体贴　神的意思、只体贴人的意思。  
16:24 于是耶稣对门徒说、若有人要跟从我、就当舍己、背起他的十字架、来跟从我。  
16:25 因为凡要救自己生命的、〔生命或作灵魂下同〕必丧掉生命。凡为我丧掉生命的、必得着生命。  

16:26 人若赚得全世界、赔上自己的生命、有甚么益处呢。人还能拿甚么换生命呢。  
16:27 人子要在他父的荣耀里、同着众使者降临。那时候、他要照各人的行为报应各人。  
16:28 我实在告诉你们、站在这里的、有人在没尝死味以前、必看见人子降临在他的国里。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 17章  

17:1 过了六天、耶稣带着彼得、雅各、和雅各的兄弟约翰、暗暗的上了高山。  
17:2 就在他们面前变了形像。脸面明亮如日头、衣裳洁白如光。  
17:3 忽然有摩西、以利亚、向他们显现、同耶稣说话。  
17:4 彼得对耶稣说、主阿、我们在这里真好。你若愿意、我就在这里搭三座棚、一座为你、一座为摩西、一座为以利亚。  
17:5 说话之间、忽然有一朵光明的云彩遮盖他们。且有声音从云彩里出来说、这是我的爱子、我所喜悦的。你们要听他。  

17:6 门徒听见、就俯伏在地、极其害怕。  
17:7 耶稣进前来、摸他们说、起来、不要害怕。  
17:8 他们举目不见一人、只见耶稣在那里。  
17:9 下山的时候、耶稣吩咐他们说、人子还没有从死里复活、你们不要将所看见的告诉人。  
17:10 门徒问耶稣说、文士为甚么说以利亚必须先来。  

17:11 耶稣回答说、以利亚固然先来、并要复兴万事。  
17:12 只是我告诉你们、以利亚已经来了、人却不认识他、竟任意待他。人子也将要这样受他们的害。  
17:13 门徒这才明白耶稣所说的、是指着施洗的约翰。  
17:14 耶稣和门徒到了众人那里、有一个人来见耶稣、跪下、说、  
17:15 主阿、怜悯我的儿子。他害癫痫的病很苦、屡次跌在火里、屡次跌在水里。  

17:16 我带他到你门徒那里、他们却不能医治他。  
17:17 耶稣说、嗳、这又不信又悖谬的世代阿、我在你们这里要到几时呢。我忍耐你们要到几时呢。把他带到我这里来吧。  
17:18 耶稣斥责那鬼、鬼就出来。从此孩子就痊癒了。  
17:19 门徒暗暗的到耶稣跟前说、我们为甚么不能赶出那鬼呢。  
17:20 耶稣说、是因你们的信心小。我实在告诉你们、你们若有信心像一粒芥菜种、就是对这座山说、你从这边挪到那边、他也必挪去。并且你们没有一件不能作的事了。  

17:21 至于这一类的鬼、若不祷告禁食、他就不出来。〔或作不能赶他出来〕
17:22 他们还住在加利利的时候、耶稣对门徒说、人子将要被交在人手里。  
17:23 他们要杀害他、第三日他要复活。门徒就大大的忧愁。  
17:24 到了迦百农、有收丁税的人来见彼得说、你们的先生不纳丁税么。〔丁税约有半块钱〕
17:25 彼得说、纳。他进了屋子、耶稣先向他说、西门、你的意思如何。世上的君王、向谁征收关税丁税。是向自己的儿子呢、是向外人呢。  

17:26 彼得说、是向外人。耶稣说、既然如此、儿子就可以免税了。  
17:27 但恐怕触犯他们、〔触犯原文作绊倒〕、你且往海边去钓鱼、把先钓上来的鱼拿起来、开了他的口、必得一块钱、可以拿去给他们、作你我的税银。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 18章   

18:1 当时、门徒进前来、问耶稣说、天国里谁是最大的。  
18:2 耶稣便叫一个小孩子来、使他站在他们当中、  
18:3 说、我实在告诉你们、你们若不回转、变成小孩子的样式、断不得进天国。  
18:4 所以凡自己谦卑像这小孩子的、他在天国里就是最大的。  
18:5 凡为我的名、接待一个像这小孩子的、就是接待我。  

18:6 凡使这信我的一个小子跌倒的、倒不如把大磨石拴在这人的颈项上、沉在深海里。  
18:7 这世界有祸了、因为将人绊倒。绊倒人的事是免不了的、但那绊倒人的有祸了。  
18:8 倘若你一只手、或是一只脚、叫你跌倒、就砍下来丢掉。你缺一只手、或是一只脚、进入永生、强如有两手两脚、被丢在永火里。  
18:9 倘若你一只眼叫你跌倒、就把他剜出来丢掉。你只有一只眼进入永生、强如有两只眼被丢在地狱的火里。  
18:10 你们要小心、不可轻看这小子里的一个。我告诉你们、他们的使者在天上、常见我天父的面。〔有古卷在此有〕

18:11 〔人子来为要拯救失丧的人〕
18:12 一个人若有一百只羊、一只走迷了路、你们的意思如何。他岂不撇下这九十九只、往山里去找那只迷路的羊么。  
18:13 若是找着了、我实在告诉你们、他为这一只羊欢喜、比为那没有迷路的九十九只欢喜还大呢。  
18:14 你们在天上的父、也是这样不愿意这小子里失丧一个。  
18:15 倘若你的弟兄得罪你、你就去趁着只有他和你在一处的时候、指出他的错来。他若听你、你便得了你的弟兄。  

18:16 他若不听、你就另外带一两个人同去、要凭两三个人的口作见证、句句都可定准。  
18:17 若是不听他们、就告诉教会。若是不听教会、就看他像外邦人和税吏一样。  
18:18 我实在告诉你们、凡你们在地上所捆绑的、在天上也要捆绑。凡你们在地上所释放的、在天上也要释放。  
18:19 我又告诉你们、若是你们中间有两个人在地上、同心合意的求甚么事、我在天上的父、必为他们成全。  
18:20 因为无论在那里、有两三个人奉我的名聚会、那里就有我在他们中间。  

18:21 那时彼得进前来、对耶稣说、主阿、我弟兄得罪我、我当饶恕他几次呢。到七次可以么。  
18:22 耶稣说、我对你说、不是到七次、乃是到七十个七次。  
18:23 天国好像一个王、要和他仆人算帐。  
18:24 才算的时候、有人带了一个欠一千万银子的来。  
18:25 因为他没有甚么偿还之物、主人吩咐把他和他妻子儿女、并一切所有的都卖了偿还。  

18:26 那仆人就俯伏拜他说、主阿、宽容我将来我都要还清。  
18:27 那仆人的主人、就动了慈心、把他释放了、并且免了他的债。  
18:28 那仆人出来、遇见他的一个同伴、欠他十两银子、便揪着他、掐住他的喉咙、说、你把所欠的还我。  
18:29 他的同伴就俯伏央求他、说、宽容我吧、将来我必还清。  
18:30 他不肯、竟去把他下在监里、等他还了所欠的债。  

18:31 众同伴看见他所作的事、就甚忧愁、去把这事都告诉了主人。  
18:32 于是主人叫了他来、对他说、你这恶奴才、你央求我、我就把你所欠的都免了。  
18:33 你不应当怜恤你的同伴、像我怜恤你么。  
18:34 主人就大怒、把他交给掌刑的、等他还清了所欠的债。  
18:35 你们各人、若不从心里饶恕你的弟兄、我天父也要这样待你们了。  


------------------------------------------

马太福音 19章   

19:1 耶稣说完了这些话、就离开加利利、来到犹太的境界、约但河外。  
19:2 有许多人跟着他。他就在那里把他们的病人治好了。  
19:3 有法利赛人来试探耶稣说、人无论甚么缘故、都可以休妻么。  
19:4 耶稣回答说、那起初造人的、是造男造女、  
19:5 并且说、『因此、人要离开父母、与妻子连合、二人成为一体。』这经你们没有念过么。  

19:6 既然如此、夫妻不再是两个人、乃是一体的了。所以　神配合的、人不可分开。  
19:7 法利赛人说、这样、摩西为甚么吩咐给妻子休书、就可以休他呢。  
19:8 耶稣说、摩西因为你们的心硬、所以许你们休妻。但起初并不是这样。  
19:9 我告诉你们、凡休妻另娶的、若不是为淫乱的缘故、就是犯奸淫了、有人娶那被休的妇人、也是犯奸淫了。  
19:10 门徒对耶稣说、人和妻子既是这样、倒不如不娶。  

19:11 耶稣说、这话不是人都能领受的。惟独赐给谁、谁才能领受。  
19:12 因为有生来是阉人、也有被人阉的、并有为天国的缘故自阉的。这话谁能领受、就可以领受。  
19:13 那时有人带着小孩子来见耶稣、要耶稣给他们按手祷告。门徒就责备那些人。  
19:14 耶稣说、让小孩子到我这里来、不要禁止他们。因为在天国的、正是这样的人。  
19:15 耶稣给他们按手、就离开那地方去了。  

19:16 有一个人来见耶稣说、夫子、〔有古卷作良善的夫子〕我该作甚么善事、才能得永生。  
19:17 耶稣对他说、你为甚么以善事问我呢、只有一位是善的、〔有古卷作你为甚么称我是良善的除了　神以外没有一个良善的〕你若要进入永生、就当遵守诫命。  
19:18 他说、甚么诫命。耶稣说、就是不可杀人、不可奸淫、不可偷盗、不可作假见证、  
19:19 当孝敬父母。又当爱人如己。  
19:20 那少年人说、这一切我都遵守了。还缺少甚么呢。  

19:21 耶稣说、你若愿意作完全人、可去变卖你所有的、分给穷人、就必有财宝在天上、你还要来跟从我。  
19:22 那少年人听见这话、就忧忧愁愁的走了。因为他的产业很多。  
19:23 耶稣对门徒说、我实在告诉你们、财主进天国是难的。  
19:24 我又告诉你们、骆驼穿过针的眼、比财主进　神的国还容易呢。  
19:25 门徒听见这话、就希奇得很、说、这样谁能得救呢。  

19:26 耶稣看着他们说、在人这是不能的。在　神凡事都能。  
19:27 彼得就对他说、看哪、我们已经撇下所有的跟从你、将来我们要得甚么呢。  
19:28 耶稣说、我实在告诉你们、你们这跟从我的人、到复兴的时候、人子坐在他荣耀的宝座上、你们也要坐在十二个宝座上、审判以色列十二个支派。  
19:29 凡为我的名撇下房屋、或是弟兄、姐妹、父亲、母亲、〔有古卷添妻子〕儿女、田地的、必要得着百倍、并且承受永生。  
19:30 然而有许多在前的将要在后、在后的将要在前。

马太福音 20章   

20:1 因为天国好像家主、清早去雇人、进他的葡萄园作工。  
20:2 和工人讲定、一天一钱银子、就打发他们进葡萄园去。  
20:3 约在巳初出去、看见市上还有闲站的人。  
20:4 就对他们说、你们也进葡萄园去、所当给的、我必给你们。他们也进去了。  
20:5 约在午正和申初又出去、也是这样行。  

20:6 约在酉初出去、看见还有人站在那里。就问他们说、你们为甚么整天在这里闲站呢。  
20:7 他们说、因为没有人雇我们。他说、你们也进葡萄园去。  
20:8 到了晚上、园主对管事的说、叫工人都来、给他们工钱、从后来的起、到先来的为止。  
20:9 约在酉初雇的人来了、各人得了一钱银子。  
20:10 及至那先雇的来了、他们以为必要多得。谁知也是各得一钱。  

20:11 他们得了、就埋怨家主说、  
20:12 我们整天劳苦受热、那后来的只做了一小时、你竟叫他们和我们一样么。  
20:13 家主回答其中的一人说、朋友、我不亏负你。你与我讲定的、不是一钱银子么。  
20:14 拿你的走吧。我给那后来的和给你一样、这是我愿意的。  
20:15 我的东西难道不可随我的意思用么。因为我作好人、你就红了眼么。  

20:16 这样、那在后的将要在前、在前的将要在后了。〔有古卷在此有因为被召的人多选上的人少〕
20:17 耶稣上耶路撒冷去的时候、在路上把十二个门徒带到一边、对他们说、  
20:18 看哪、我们上耶路撒冷去、人子要被交给祭司长和文士。他们要定他死罪。  
20:19 又交给外邦人、将他戏弄、鞭打、钉在十字架上。第三日他要复活。  
20:20 那时、西庇太儿子的母亲、同他两个儿子上前来、拜耶稣、求他一件事。  

20:21 耶稣说、你要甚么呢。他说、愿你叫我这两个儿子在你国里、一个坐在你右边、一个坐在你左边。  
20:22 耶稣回答说、你们不知道所求的是甚么。我将要喝的杯、你们能喝么。他们说、我们能。  
20:23 耶稣说、我所喝的杯、你们必要喝。只是坐在我的左右、不是我可以赐的。乃是我父为谁预备的、就赐给谁。  
20:24 那十个门徒听见、就恼怒他们弟兄二人。  
20:25 耶稣叫了他们来、说、你们知道外邦人有君王为主治理他们、有大臣操权管束他们。  

20:26 只是在你们中间不可这样。你们中间谁愿为大、就必作你们的用人。  
20:27 谁愿为首、就必作你们的仆人。  
20:28 正如人子来、不是要受人的服事、乃是要服事人。并且要舍命、作多人的赎价。  
20:29 他们出耶利哥的时候、有极多的人跟随他、  
20:30 有两个瞎子坐在路旁、听说是耶稣经过、就喊着说、主阿、大卫的子孙、可怜我们吧。  

20:31 众人责备他们、不许他们作声。他们却越发喊着说、主阿、大卫的子孙、可怜我们吧。  
20:32 耶稣就站住、叫他们来、说、要我为你们作甚么。  
20:33 他们说、主阿、要我们的眼睛能看见。  
20:34 耶稣就动了慈心、把他们的眼睛一摸、他们立刻看见、就跟从了耶稣。

马太福音 21章   

21:1 耶稣和门徒将近耶路撒冷、到了伯法其在橄榄山那里。  
21:2 耶稣就打发两个门徒、对他们说、你们往对面村子里去、必看见一匹驴拴在那里、还有驴驹同在一处。你们解开牵到我这里来。  
21:3 若有人对你们说甚么、你们就说、主要用他。那人必立时让你们牵来。  
21:4 这事成就、是要应验先知的话、说、  
21:5 『要对锡安的居民〔原文作女子〕说、看哪、你的王来到你这里、是温柔的、又骑着驴、就是骑着驴驹子。』  

21:6 门徒就照耶稣所吩咐的去行、  
21:7 牵了驴和驴驹来、把自己的衣服搭在上面、耶稣就骑上。  
21:8 众人多半把衣服铺在路上。还有人砍下树枝来铺在路上。  
21:9 前行后随的众人、喊着说、和散那归于大卫的子孙、〔和散那原有求救的意思在此乃称颂的话〕奉主名来的、是应当称颂的。高高在上和散那。  
21:10 耶稣既进了耶路撒冷、合城都惊动了、说、这是谁。  

21:11 众人说、这是加利利拿撒勒的先知耶稣。  
21:12 耶稣进了　神的殿、赶出殿里一切作买卖的人、推倒兑换银钱之人的桌子、和卖鸽子之人的凳子。  
21:13 对他们说、经上记着说、『我的殿必称为祷告的殿。你们倒使他成为贼窝了。』  
21:14 在殿里有瞎子瘸子、到耶稣跟前。他就治好了他们。  
21:15 祭司长和文士、看见耶稣所行的奇事、又见小孩子在殿里喊着说、和散那归于大卫的子孙。就甚恼怒、  

21:16 对他说、这些人所说的、你听见了么。耶稣说、是的。经上说、『你从婴孩和吃奶的口中、完全了赞美的话。』你们没有念过么。  
21:17 于是离开他们、出城到伯大尼去、在那里住宿。  
21:18 早晨回城的时候、他饿了。  
21:19 看见路旁有一棵无花果树、就走到跟前、在树上找不着甚么、不过有叶子。就对树说、从今以后、你永不结果子。那无花果树就立刻枯干了。  
21:20 门徒看见了、便希奇说、无花果树怎么立刻枯干了呢。  

21:21 耶稣回答说、我实在告诉你们、你们若有信心、不疑惑、不但能行无花果树上所行的事、就是对这座山说、你挪开此地、投在海里、也必成就。  
21:22 你们祷告、无论求甚么、只要信、就必得着。  
21:23 耶稣进了殿、正教训人的时候、祭司长和民间的长老来问他说、你仗着甚么权柄作这些事。给你这权柄的是谁呢。  
21:24 耶稣回答说、我也要问你们一句话、你们若告诉我、我就告诉你们我仗着甚么权柄作这些事。  
21:25 约翰的洗礼是从那里来的。是从天上来的、是从人间来的呢。他们彼此商议说、我们若说从天上来、他必对我们说、这样、你们为甚么不信他呢。  

21:26 若说从人间来、我们又怕百姓。因为他们都以约翰为先知。  
21:27 于是回答耶稣说、我们不知道。耶稣说、我也不告诉你们我仗着甚么权柄作这些事。  
21:28 又说、一个人有两个儿子、他来对大儿子说、我儿、你今天到葡萄园里去作工。  
21:29 他回答说、我不去。以后自己懊悔就去了。  
21:30 又来对小儿子也是这样说、他回答说、父阿、我去。他却不去。  

21:31 你们想这两个儿子、是那一个遵行父命呢。他们说、大儿子、耶稣说、我实在告诉你们、税吏和娼妓、倒比你们先进　神的国。  
21:32 因为约翰遵着义路到你们这里来、你们却不信他。税吏和娼妓倒信他。你们看见了、后来还是不懊悔去信他。  
21:33 你们再听一个比喻。有个家主、栽了一个葡萄园、周围圈上篱笆、里面挖了一个压酒池、盖了一座楼、租给园户、就往外国去了。  
21:34 收果子的时候近了、就打发仆人、到园户那里去收果子。  
21:35 园户拿住仆人。打了一个、杀了一个、用石头打死一个。  

21:36 主人又打发别的仆人去、比先前更多。园户还是照样待他们。  
21:37 后来打发他的儿子到他们那里去、意思说、他们必尊敬我的儿子。  
21:38 不料、园户看见他儿子、就彼此说、这是承受产业的。来吧、我们杀他、占他的产业。  
21:39 他们就拿住他、推出葡萄园外、杀了。  
21:40 园主来的时候、要怎样处治这些园户呢。  

21:41 他们说、要下毒手除灭那些恶人、将葡萄园另租给那按着时候交果子的园户。  
21:42 耶稣说、经上写着、『匠人所弃的石头、已作了房角的头块石头。这是主所作的、在我们眼中看为希奇。』这经你们没有念过么。  
21:43 所以我告诉你们。　神的国、必从你们夺去。赐给那能结果子的百姓。  
21:44 谁掉在这石头上、必要跌碎。这石头掉在谁的身上、就要把谁砸得稀烂。  
21:45 祭司长和法利赛人、听见他的比喻、就看出他是指着他们说的。  

21:46 他们想要捉拿他、只是怕众人、因为众人以他为先知。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 22章   

22:1 耶稣又用比喻对他们说、  
22:2 天国好比一个王、为他儿子摆设娶亲的筵席。  
22:3 就打发仆人去、请那些被召的人来赴席。他们却不肯来。  
22:4 王又打发别的仆人说、你们告诉那被召的人、我的筵席已经预备好了、牛和肥畜已经宰了、各样都齐备。请你们来赴席。  
22:5 那些人不理就走了。一个到自己田里去。一个作买卖去。  

22:6 其余的拿住仆人、凌辱他们、把他们杀了。  
22:7 王就大怒、发兵除灭那些凶手、烧毁他们的城。  
22:8 于是对仆人说、喜筵已经齐备、只是所召的人不配。  
22:9 所以你们要往岔路口上去、凡遇见的、都召来赴席。  
22:10 那些仆人就出去到大路上、凡遇见的、不论善恶都召聚了来。筵席上就坐满了客。  

22:11 王进来观看宾客、见那里有一个没有穿礼服的。  
22:12 就对他说、朋友、你到这里来、怎么不穿礼服呢。那人无言可答。  
22:13 于是王对使唤的人说、捆起他的手脚来、把他丢在外边的黑暗里。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。  
22:14 因为被召的人多、选上的人少。  
22:15 当时、法利赛人出去商议、怎样就着耶稣的话陷害他。  

22:16 就打发他们的门徒、同希律党的人、去见耶稣说、夫子、我们知道你是诚实人、并且诚诚实实传　神的道、甚么人你都不徇情面、因为你不看人的外貌。  
22:17 请告诉我们、你的意见如何。纳税给该撒、可以不可以。  
22:18 耶稣看出他们的恶意、就说、假冒为善的人哪、为甚么试探我。  
22:19 拿一个上税的钱给我看。他们就拿一个银钱来给他。  
22:20 耶稣说、这像和这号是谁的。  

22:21 他们说、是该撒的。耶稣说、这样、该撒的物当归给该撒、　神的物当归给　神。  
22:22 他们听见就希奇、离开他走了。  
22:23 撒都该人常说没有复活的事。那天、他们来问耶稣说、  
22:24 夫子、摩西说、人若死了、没有孩子、他兄弟当娶他的妻、为哥哥生子立后。  
22:25 从前在我们这里、有弟兄七人。第一个娶了妻、死了、没有孩子、撇下妻子给兄弟。  

22:26 第二第三直到第七个、都是如此。  
22:27 末后、妇人也死了。  
22:28 这样、当复活的时候、他是七个人中、那一个的妻子呢。因为他们都娶过他。  
22:29 耶稣回答说、你们错了。因为不明白圣经、也不晓得　神的大能。  
22:30 当复活的时候、人也不娶也不嫁、乃像天上的使者一样。  

22:31 论到死人复活、　神在经上向你们所说的、你们没有念过么。  
22:32 他说、『我是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神。』　神不是死人的　神、乃是活人的　神。  
22:33 众人听见这话、就希奇他的教训。  
22:34 法利赛人听见耶稣堵住了撒都该人的口、他们就聚集。  
22:35 内中有一个人是律法师、要试探耶稣、就问他说、  

22:36 夫子、律法上的诫命、那一条是最大的呢。  
22:37 耶稣对他说、你要尽心、尽性、尽意、爱主你的　神。  
22:38 这是诫命中的第一、且是最大的。  
22:39 其次也相仿、就是要爱人如己。  
22:40 这两条诫命、是律法和先知一切道理的总纲。  

22:41 法利赛人聚集的时候、耶稣问他们说、  
22:42 论到基督、你们的意见如何。他是谁的子孙呢。他们回答说、是大卫的子孙。  
22:43 耶稣说、这样、大卫被圣灵感动、怎么还称他为主。说、  
22:44 『主对我主说、你坐在我的右边、等我把你仇敌、放在你的脚下。』  
22:45 大卫既称他为主、他怎么又是大卫的子孙呢。  

22:46 他们没有一个人能回答一言。从那日以后、也没有人敢再问他甚么。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 23章   

23:1 那时、耶稣对众人和门徒讲论、  
23:2 说、文士和法利赛人、坐在摩西的位上。  
23:3 凡他们所吩咐你们的、你们都要谨守、遵行。但不要效法他们的行为。因为他们能说不能行。  
23:4 他们把难担的重担、捆起来搁在人的肩上。但自己一个指头也不肯动。  
23:5 他们一切所作的事、都是要叫人看见。所以将佩戴的经文做宽了、衣裳的繸子做长了。  

23:6 喜爱筵席上的首座、会堂里的高位。  
23:7 又喜爱人在街市上问他安、称呼他拉比。〔拉比就是夫子〕
23:8 但你们不要受拉比的称呼。因为只有一位是你们的夫子。你们都是弟兄。  
23:9 也不要称呼地上的人为父。因为只有一位是你们的父、就是在天上的父。  
23:10 也不要受师尊的称呼。因为只有一位是你们的师尊、就是基督。  

23:11 你们中间谁为大、谁就要作你们的用人。  
23:12 凡自高的必降为卑、自卑的必升为高。  
23:13 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们正当人前、把天国的门关了。自己不进去、正要进去的人、你们也不容他们进去。〔有古卷在此有〕
23:14 〔你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了因为你们侵吞寡妇的家产假意作很长的祷告所以要受更重的刑罚〕
23:15 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们走遍洋海陆地、勾引一个人入教。既入了教、却使他作地狱之子、比你们还加倍。  

23:16 你们这瞎眼领路的有祸了。你们说、凡指着殿起誓的、这算不得甚么。只是凡指着殿中金子起誓的、他就该谨守。  
23:17 你们这无知瞎眼的人哪、甚么是大的、是金子呢、还是叫金子成圣的殿呢。  
23:18 你们又说、凡指着坛起誓的、这算不得甚么。只是凡指着坛上礼物起誓的、他就该谨守。  
23:19 你们这瞎眼的人哪、甚么是大的、是礼物呢、还是叫礼物成圣的坛呢。  
23:20 所以人指着坛起誓、就是指着坛和坛上一切所有的起誓。  

23:21 人指着殿起誓、就是指着殿和那住在殿里的起誓。  
23:22 人指着天起誓、就是指着　神的宝座和那坐在上面的起誓。  
23:23 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们将薄荷、茴香、芹菜、献上十分之一。那律法上更重的事、就是公义、怜悯、信实、反倒不行了。这更重的是你们当行的、那也是不可不行的。  
23:24 你们这瞎眼领路的、蠓虫你们就滤出来、骆驼你们倒吞下去。  
23:25 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们洗净杯盘的外面、里面却盛满了勒索和放荡。  

23:26 你这瞎眼的法利赛人、先洗净杯盘的里面、好叫外面也干净了。  
23:27 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们好像粉饰的坟墓、外面好看、里面却装满了死人的骨头、和一切的污秽。  
23:28 你们也是如此、在人前、外面显出公义来、里面却装满了假善和不法的事。  
23:29 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们建造先知的坟、修饰义人的墓、说、  
23:30 若是我们在我们祖宗的时候、必不和他们同流先知的血。  

23:31 这就是你们自己证明、是杀害先知者的子孙了。  
23:32 你们去充满你们祖宗的恶贯吧。  
23:33 你们这些蛇类、毒蛇之种阿、怎能逃脱地狱的刑罚呢。  
23:34 所以我差遣先知和智慧人并文士、到你们这里来。有的你们要杀害、要钉十字架。有的你们要在会堂里鞭打、从这城追逼到那城。  
23:35 叫世上所流义人的血、都归到你们身上。从义人亚伯的血起、直到你们在殿和坛中间所杀的巴拉加的儿子撒迦利亚的血为止。  

23:36 我实在告诉你们、这一切的罪、都要归到这世代了。  
23:37 耶路撒冷阿、耶路撒冷阿、你常杀害先知、又用石头打死那奉差遣到你这里来的人。我多次愿意聚集你的儿女、好像母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下、只是你们不愿意。  
23:38 看哪、你们的家成为荒场、留给你们。  
23:39 我告诉你们、从今以后、你们不得再见我、直等到你们说、奉主名来的、是应当称颂的。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 24章   

24:1 耶稣出了圣殿、正走的时候、门徒进前来、把殿宇指给他看。  
24:2 耶稣对他们说、你们不是看见这殿宇么。我实在告诉你们、将来在这里、没有一块石头留在石头上不被拆毁了。  
24:3 耶稣在橄榄山上坐着、门徒暗暗的来说、请告诉我们、甚么时候有这些事。你降临和世界的末了、有甚么预兆呢。  
24:4 耶稣回答说、你们要谨慎、免得有人迷惑你们。  
24:5 因为将来有好些人冒我的名来、说、我是基督、并且要迷惑许多人。  

24:6 你们也要听见打仗和打仗的风声、总不要惊慌。因为这些事是必须有的。只是末期还没有到。  
24:7 民要攻打民、国要攻打国。多处必有饥荒、地震。  
24:8 这都是灾难的起头。〔灾难原文作生产之难〕
24:9 那时、人要把你们陷在患难里、也要杀害你们。你们又要为我的名、被万民恨恶。  
24:10 那时、必有许多人跌倒、也要彼此陷害、彼此恨恶。  

24:11 且有好些假先知起来、迷惑多人。  
24:12 只因不法的事增多、许多人的爱心、才渐渐冷淡了。  
24:13 惟有忍耐到底的、必然得救。  
24:14 这天国的福音、要传遍天下、对万民作见证、然后末期才来到。  
24:15 你们看见先知但以理所说的、那行毁坏可憎的、站在圣地。（读这经的人须要会意)  

24:16 那时、在犹太的、应当逃到山上。  
24:17 在房上的、不要下来拿家里的东西。  
24:18 在田里的、也不要回去取衣裳。  
24:19 当那些日子、怀孕的和奶孩子的有祸了。  
24:20 你们应当祈求、叫你们逃走的时候、不遇见冬天、或是安息日。  

24:21 因为那时、必有大灾难、从世界的起头、直到如今、没有这样的灾难、后来也必没有。  
24:22 若不减少那日子、凡有血气的、总没有一个得救的。只是为选民、那日子必减少了。  
24:23 那时、若有人对你们说、基督在这里。或说、基督在那里。你们不要信。  
24:24 因为假基督、假先知、将要起来、显大神迹、大奇事。倘若能行、连选民也就迷惑了。  
24:25 看哪、我预先告诉你们了。  

24:26 若有人对你们说、看哪、基督在旷野里。你们不要出去。或说、看哪、基督在内屋中。你们不要信。  
24:27 闪电从东边发出、直照到西边。人子降临、也要这样。  
24:28 尸首在那里、鹰也必聚在那里。  
24:29 那些日子的灾难一过去、日头就变黑了、月亮也不放光、众星要从天上坠落、天势都要震动。  
24:30 那时、人子的兆头要显在天上、地上的万族都要哀哭。他们要看见人子、有能力、有大荣耀、驾着天上的云降临。  

24:31 他要差遣使者、用号筒的大声、将他的选民、从四方、从天这边、到天那边、都招聚了来。〔方原文作风〕
24:32 你们可以从无花果树学个比方。当树枝发嫩长叶的时候、你们就知道夏天近了。  
24:33 这样、你们看见这一切的事、也该知道人子近了、正在门口了。  
24:34 我实在告诉你们、这世代还没有过去、这些事都要成就。  
24:35 天地要废去、我的话却不能废去。  

24:36 但那日子、那时辰、没有人知道、连天上的使者也不知道、子也不知道、惟独父知道。  
24:37 挪亚的日子怎样、人子降临也要怎样。  
24:38 当洪水以前的日子、人照常吃喝嫁娶、直到挪亚进方舟的那日。  
24:39 不知不觉洪水来了、把他们全都冲去。人子降临也要这样。  
24:40 那时、两个人在田里、取去一个、撇下一个。  

24:41 两个女人推磨。取去一个、撇下一个。  
24:42 所以你们要儆醒、因为不知道你们的主是那一天来到。  
24:43 家主若知道几更天有贼来、就必儆醒、不容人挖透房屋。这是你们所知道的。  
24:44 所以你们也要预备。因为你们想不到的时候、人子就来了。  
24:45 谁是忠心有见识的仆人、为主人所派、管理家里的人、按时分粮给他们呢。  

24:46 主人来到、看见他这样行、那仆人就有福了。  
24:47 我实在告诉你们、主人要派他管理一切所有的。  
24:48 倘若那恶仆心里说、我的主人必来得迟、  
24:49 就动手打他的同伴、又和酒醉的人一同吃喝。  
24:50 在想不到的日子、不知道的时辰、那仆人的主人要来、  

24:51 重重的处治他、〔或作把他腰斩了〕定他和假冒为善的人同罪。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 25章   

25:1 那时、天国好比十个童女、拿着灯、出去迎接新郎。  
25:2 其中有五个是愚拙的。五个是聪明的。  
25:3 愚拙的拿着灯、却不预备油。  
25:4 聪明的拿着灯、又预备油在器皿里。  
25:5 新郎迟延的时候、他们都打盹睡着了。  

25:6 半夜有人喊着说、新郎来了、你们出来迎接他。  
25:7 那些童女就都起来收拾灯。  
25:8 愚拙的对聪明的说、请分点油给我们。因为我们的灯要灭了。  
25:9 聪明的回答说、恐怕不够你我用的。不如你们自己到卖油的那里去买吧。  
25:10 他们去买的时候、新郎到了。那预备好了的、同他进去坐席。门就关了。  

25:11 其余的童女、随后也来了、说、主阿、主阿、给我们开门。  
25:12 他却回答说、我实在告诉你们、我不认识你们。  
25:13 所以你们要儆醒、因为那日子、那时辰、你们不知道。  
25:14 天国又好比一个人要往外国去、就叫了仆人来、把他的家业交给他们。  
25:15 按着各人的才干、给他们银子。一个给了五千、一个给了二千、一个给了一千。就往外国去了。  

25:16 那领五千的、随即拿去做买卖、另外赚了五千。  
25:17 那领二千的、也照样另赚了二千。  
25:18 但那领一千的、去掘开地、把主人的银子埋藏了。  
25:19 过了许久、那些仆人的主人来了、和他们算帐。  
25:20 那领五千银子的、又带着那另外的五千来、说、主阿、你交给我五千银子、请看、我又赚了五千。  

25:21 主人说、好、你这又良善又忠心的仆人。你在不多的事上有忠心、我要把许多事派你管理。可以进来享受你主人的快乐。  
25:22 那领二千的也来说、主阿、你交给我二千银子、请看、我又赚了二千。  
25:23 主人说、好、你这又良善又忠心的仆人。你在不多的事上有忠心、我要把许多事派你管理。可以进来享受你主人的快乐。  
25:24 那领一千的、也来说、主阿、我知道你是忍心的人、没有种的地方要收割、没有散的地方要聚敛。  
25:25 我就害怕、去把你的一千银子埋藏在地里。请看、你的原银子在这里。  

25:26 主人回答说、你这又恶又懒的仆人、你既知道我没有种的地方要收割、没有散的地方要聚敛。  
25:27 就当把我的银子放给兑换银钱的人、到我来的时候、可以连本带利收回。  
25:28 夺过他这一千来、给那有一万的。  
25:29 因为凡有的、还要加给他、叫他有余。没有的、连他所有的、也要夺过来。  
25:30 把这无用的仆人、丢在外面黑暗里。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。  

25:31 当人子在他荣耀里、同着众天使降临的时候、要坐在他荣耀的宝座上。  
25:32 万民都要聚集在他面前。他要把他们分别出来、好像牧羊的分别绵羊山羊一般。  
25:33 把绵羊安置在右边、山羊在左边。  
25:34 于是王要向那右边的说、你们这蒙我父赐福的、可来承受那创世以来为你们所预备的国。  
25:35 因为我饿了、你们给我吃。渴了、你们给我喝。我作客旅、你们留我住。  

25:36 我赤身露体、你们给我穿。我病了、你们看顾我。我在监里、你们来看我。  
25:37 义人就回答说、主阿、我们甚么时候见你饿了给你吃、渴了给你喝。  
25:38 甚么时候见你作客旅留你住、或是赤身露体给你穿。  
25:39 又甚么时候见你病了、或是在监里、来看你呢。  
25:40 王要回答说、我实在告诉你们、这些事你们既作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上、就是作在我身上了。  

25:41 王又要向那左边的说、你们这被咒诅的人、离开我、进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去。  
25:42 因为我饿了、你们不给我吃。渴了、你们不给我喝。  
25:43 我作客旅、你们不留我住。我赤身露体、你们不给我穿。我病了、我在监里、你们不来看顾我。  
25:44 他们也要回答说、主阿、我们甚么时候见你饿了、或渴了、或作客旅、或赤身露体、或病了、或在监里、不伺候你呢。  
25:45 王要回答说、我实在告诉你们、这些事你们既不作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上、就是不作在我身上了。  

25:46 这些人要往永刑里去。那些义人要往永生里去。

马太福音 26章   

26:1 耶稣说完了这一切的话、就对门徒说、  
26:2 你们知道过两天是逾越节、人子将要被交给人、钉在十字架上。  
26:3 那时、祭司长和民间的长老、聚集在大祭司称为该亚法的院里。  
26:4 大家商议、要用诡计拿住耶稣杀他。  
26:5 只是说、当节的日子不可、恐怕民间生乱。  

26:6 耶稣在伯大尼长大痲疯的西门家里、  
26:7 有一个女人、拿着一玉瓶极贵的香膏来、趁耶稣坐席的时候、浇在他的头上。  
26:8 门徒看见、就很不喜悦、说、何用这样的枉费呢。  
26:9 这香膏可以卖许多钱、赒济穷人。  
26:10 耶稣看出他们的意思、就说、为甚么难为这女人呢。他在我身上作的、是一件美事。  

26:11 因为常有穷人和你们同在。只是你们不常有我。  
26:12 他将这香膏浇在我身上、是为我安葬作的。  
26:13 我实在告诉你们、普天之下、无论在甚么地方传这福音、也要述说这女人所行的、作个记念。  
26:14 当下、十二门徒里、有一个称为加略人犹大的、去见祭司长、说、  
26:15 我把他交给你们、你们愿意给我多少钱。他们就给了他三十块钱。  

26:16 从那时候、他就找机会、要把耶稣交给他们。  
26:17 除酵节的第一天、门徒来问耶稣说、你吃逾越节的筵席、要我们在那里给你预备。  
26:18 耶稣说、你们进城去、到某人那里、对他说、夫子说、我的时候快到了。我与门徒要在你家里守逾越节。  
26:19 门徒遵着耶稣所吩咐的就去预备了逾越节的筵席。  
26:20 到了晚上、耶稣和十二个门徒坐席。  

26:21 正吃的时候、耶稣说、我实在告诉你们、你们中间有一个人要卖我了。  
26:22 他们就甚忧愁、一个一个的问他说、主、是我么。  
26:23 耶稣回答说、同我蘸手在盘子里的、就是他要卖我。  
26:24 人子必要去世、正如经上指着他所写的、但卖人子的人有祸了。那人不生在世上倒好。  
26:25 卖耶稣的犹大问他说、拉比、是我么。耶稣说、你说的是。  

26:26 他们吃的时候、耶稣拿起饼来、祝福、就擘开、递给门徒、说、你们拿着吃。这是我的身体。  
26:27 又拿起杯来、祝谢了、递给他们、说、你们都喝这个。  
26:28 因为这是我立约的血、为多人流出来、使罪得赦。  
26:29 但我告诉你们、从今以后、我不再喝这葡萄汁、直到我在我父的国里、同你们喝新的那日子。  
26:30 他们唱了诗、就出来往橄榄山去。  

26:31 那时、耶稣对他们说、今夜你们为我的缘故、都要跌倒。因为经上记着说、『我要击打牧人、羊就分散了。』  
26:32 但我复活以后、要在你们以先往加利利去。  
26:33 彼得说、众人虽然为你的缘故跌倒、我却永不跌倒。  
26:34 耶稣说、我实在告诉你、今夜鸡叫以先、你要三次不认我。  
26:35 彼得说、我就是必须和你同死、也总不能不认你。众门徒都是这样说、  

26:36 耶稣同门徒来到一个地方、名叫客西马尼、就对他们说、你们坐在这里、等我到那边去祷告。  
26:37 于是带着彼得、和西庇太的两个儿子同去、就忧愁起来、极其难过。  
26:38 便对他们说、我心里甚是忧伤、几乎要死。你们在这里等候、和我一同儆醒。  
26:39 他就稍往前走、俯伏在地、祷告说、我父阿、倘若可行、求你叫这杯离开我。然而不要照我的意思、只要照你的意思。  
26:40 来到门徒那里、见他们睡着了、就对彼得说、怎么样、你们不能同我儆醒片时么。  

26:41 总要儆醒祷告、免得入了迷惑。你们心灵固然愿意、肉体却软弱了。  
26:42 第二次又去祷告说、我父阿、这杯若不能离开我、必要我喝、就愿你的意旨成全。  
26:43 又来见他们睡着了、因为他们的眼睛困倦。  
26:44 耶稣又离开他们去了。第三次祷告、说的话还是与先前一样。  
26:45 于是来到门徒那里、对他们说、现在你们仍然睡觉安歇吧。〔吧或作么〕时候到了、人子被卖在罪人手里了。  

26:46 起来、我们走吧。看哪、卖我的人近了。  
26:47 说话之间、那十二个门徒里的犹大来了、并有许多人、带着刀棒、从祭司长和民间的长老那里、与他同来。  
26:48 那卖耶稣的、给了他们一个暗号、说、我与谁亲嘴、谁就是他。你们可以拿住他。  
26:49 犹大随即到耶稣跟前说、请拉比安。就与他亲嘴。  
26:50 耶稣对他说、朋友、你来要作的事、就作吧。于是那些人上前、下手拿住耶稣。  

26:51 有跟随耶稣的一个人、伸手拔出刀来、将大祭司的仆人砍了一刀、削掉了他一个耳朵。  
26:52 耶稣对他说、收刀入鞘吧。凡动刀的、必死在刀下。  
26:53 你想我不能求我父、现在为我差遣十二营多天使来么。  
26:54 若是这样、经上所说、事情必须如此的话、怎么应验呢。  
26:55 当时、耶稣对众人说、你们带着刀棒、出来拿我、如同拿强盗么。我天天坐在殿里教训人、你们并没有拿我。  

26:56 但这一切的事成就了、为要应验先知书上的话。当下、门徒都离开他逃走了。  
26:57 拿耶稣的人、把他带到大祭司该亚法那里去。文士和长老、已经在那里聚会。  
26:58 彼得远远的跟着耶稣、直到大祭司的院子、进到里面、就和差役同坐、要看这事到底怎样。  
26:59 祭司长和全公会、寻找假见证、控告耶稣、要治死他。  
26:60 虽有好些人来作假见证、总得不着实据。末后有两个人前来说、  

26:61 这个人曾说、我能拆毁　神的殿、三日内又建造起来。  
26:62 大祭司就站起来、对耶稣说、你甚么都不回答么。这些人作见证告你的是甚么呢。  
26:63 耶稣却不言语。大祭司对他说、我指着永生　神、叫你起誓告诉我们、你是　神的儿子基督不是。  
26:64 耶稣对他说、你说的是。然而我告诉你们、后来你们要看见人子、坐在那权能者的右边、驾着天上的云降临。  
26:65 大祭司就撕开衣服说、他说了僭妄的话、我们何必再用见证人呢。这僭妄的话、现在你们都听见了。  

26:66 你们的意见如何。他们回答说、他是该死的。  
26:67 他们就吐唾沫在他脸上、用拳头打他。也有用手掌打他的、说、  
26:68 基督阿、你是先知、告诉我们打你的是谁。  
26:69 彼得在外面院子里坐着、有一个使女前来说、你素来也是同那加利利人耶稣一伙的。  
26:70 彼得在众人面前却不承认、说、我不知道你说的是甚么。  

26:71 既出去、到了门口、又有一个使女看见他、就对那里的人说、这个人也是同拿撒勒人耶稣一伙的。  
26:72 彼得又不承认、并且起誓说、我不认得那个人。  
26:73 过了不多的时候、旁边站着的人前来、对彼得说。你真是他们一党的、你的口音把你露出来了。  
26:74 彼得就发咒起誓的说、我不认得那个人。立时鸡就叫了。  
26:75 彼得想起耶稣所说的话、鸡叫以先、你要三次不认我。他就出去痛哭。

马太福音 27章   

27:1 到了早晨、众祭司长和民间的长老、大家商议、要治死耶稣。  
27:2 就把他捆绑解去交给巡抚彼拉多。  
27:3 这时候、卖耶稣的犹大、看见耶稣已经定了罪、就后悔、把那三十块钱、拿回来给祭司长和长老说、  
27:4 我卖了无辜之人的血、是有罪了。他们说、那与我们有甚么相干。你自己承当吧。  
27:5 犹大就把那银钱丢在殿里、出去吊死了。  

27:6 祭司长拾起银钱来说、这是血价、不可放在库里。  
27:7 他们商议、就用那银钱买了窑户的一块田、为要埋葬外乡人。  
27:8 所以那块田、直到今日还叫作血田。  
27:9 这就应了先知耶利米的话、说、『他们用那三十块钱、就是被估定之人的价钱、是以色列人中所估定的、  
27:10 买了窑户的一块田。这是照着主所吩咐我的。』  

27:11 耶稣站在巡抚面前、巡抚问他说、你是犹太人的王么。耶稣说、你说的是。  
27:12 他被祭司长和长老控告的时候、甚么都不回答。  
27:13 彼拉多就对他说、他们作见证、告你这么多的事、你没有听见么。  
27:14 耶稣仍不回答、连一句话也不说、以致巡抚甚觉希奇。  
27:15 巡抚有一个常例、每逢这节期、随众人所要的、释放一个囚犯给他们。  

27:16 当时、有一个出名的囚犯叫巴拉巴。  
27:17 众人聚集的时候、彼拉多就对他们说、你们要我释放那一个给你们。是巴拉巴呢、是称为基督的耶稣呢。  
27:18 巡抚原知道、他们是因为嫉妒才把他解了来。  
27:19 正坐堂的时候、他的夫人打发人来说、这义人的事、你一点不可管。因为我今天在梦中、为他受了许多的苦。  
27:20 祭司长和长老、挑唆众人、求释放巴拉巴、除灭耶稣。  

27:21 巡抚对众人说、这两个人、你们要我释放那一个给你们呢。他们说、巴拉巴。  
27:22 彼拉多说、这样、那称为基督的耶稣、我怎么办他呢。他们都说、把他钉十字架。  
27:23 巡抚说、为甚么呢、他作了甚么恶事呢。他们便极力的喊着说、把他钉十字架。  
27:24 彼拉多见说也无济于事、反要生乱、就拿水在众人面前洗手、说、流这义人的血、罪不在我、你们承当吧。  
27:25 众人都回答说、他的血归到我们、和我们的子孙身上。  

27:26 于是彼拉多释放巴拉巴给他们、把耶稣鞭打了、交给人钉十字架。  
27:27 巡抚的兵就把耶稣带进衙门、叫全营的兵都聚集在他那里。  
27:28 他们给他脱了衣服、穿上一件朱红色袍子。  
27:29 用荆棘编作冠冕、戴在他头上、拿一根苇子放在他右手里。跪在他面前戏弄他说、恭喜犹太人的王阿。  
27:30 又吐唾沫在他脸上、拿苇子打他的头。  

27:31 戏弄完了、就给他脱了袍子、仍穿上他自己的衣服、带他出去、要钉十字架。  
27:32 他们出来的时候、遇见一个古利奈人、名叫西门、就勉强他同去、好背着耶稣的十字架。  
27:33 到了一个地方、名叫各各他、意思就是髑髅地。  
27:34 兵丁拿苦胆调和的酒、给耶稣喝。他尝了、就不肯喝。  
27:35 他们既将他钉在十字架上、就拈阄分他的衣服。  

27:36 又坐在那里看守他。  
27:37 在他头以上、安一个牌子、写着他的罪状、说、这是犹太人的王耶稣。  
27:38 当时、有两个强盗、和他同钉十字架、一个在右边一个在左边。  
27:39 从那里经过的人、讥诮他、摇着头说、  
27:40 你这拆毁圣殿、三日又建造起来的、可以救自己吧。你如果是　神的儿子、就从十字架上下来吧。  

27:41 祭司长和文士并长老、也是这样戏弄他、说、  
27:42 他救了别人、不能救自己。他是以色列的王、现在可以从十字架上下来、我们就信他。  
27:43 他倚靠　神、　神若喜悦他、现在可以救他。因为他曾说、我是　神的儿子。  
27:44 那和他同钉的强盗、也是这样的讥诮他。  
27:45 从午正到申初、遍地都黑暗了。  

27:46 约在申初、耶稣大声喊着说、以利、以利、拉马撒巴各大尼。就是说、我的　神、我的　神、为甚么离弃我。  
27:47 站在那里的人、有的听见就说、这个人呼叫以利亚呢。  
27:48 内中有一个人、赶紧跑去、拿海绒蘸满了醋、绑在苇子上、送给他喝。  
27:49 其余的人说、且等着、看以利亚来救他不来。  
27:50 耶稣又大声喊叫、气就断了。  

27:51 忽然殿里的幔子、从上到下裂为两半。地也震动。磐石也崩裂。  
27:52 坟墓也开了。已睡圣徒的身体、多有起来的。  
27:53 到耶稣复活以后、他们从坟墓里出来、进了圣城、向许多人显现。  
27:54 百夫长和一同看守耶稣的人、看见地震、并所经历的事、就极其害怕、说、这真是　神的儿子了。  
27:55 有好些妇女在那里、远远的观看。他们是从加利利跟随耶稣来服事他的。  

27:56 内中有抹大拉的马利亚、又有雅各和约西的母亲马利亚、并有西庇太两个儿子的母亲。  
27:57 到了晚上、有一个财主、名叫约瑟、是亚利马太来的。他也是耶稣的门徒。  
27:58 这人去见彼拉多、求耶稣的身体。彼拉多就吩咐给他。  
27:59 约瑟取了身体、用干净细麻布裹好、  
27:60 安放在自己的新坟墓里、就是他凿在磐石里的。他又把大石头滚到墓门口、就去了。  

27:61 有抹大拉的马利亚、和那个马利亚在那里、对着坟墓坐着。  
27:62 次日、就是预备日的第二天、祭司长和法利赛人聚集、来见彼拉多、说、  
27:63 大人、我们记得那诱惑人的、还活着的时候、曾说、三日后我要复活。  
27:64 因此、请吩咐人将坟墓把守妥当、直到第三日。恐怕他的门徒来把他偷了去、就告诉百姓说、他从死里复活了。这样、那后来的迷惑、比先前的更利害了。  
27:65 彼拉多说、你们有看守的兵。去吧、尽你们所能的、把守妥当。  

27:66 他们就带着看守的兵同去、封了石头、将坟墓把守妥当。  

------------------------------------------

马太福音 28章  

28:1 安息日将尽、七日的头一日、天快亮的时候、抹大拉的马利亚、和那个马利亚、来看坟墓。  
28:2 忽然地大震动。因为有主的使者、从天上下来、把石头滚开、坐在上面。  
28:3 他的像貌如同闪电、衣服洁白如雪。  
28:4 看守的人、就因他吓得浑身乱战、甚至和死人一样。  
28:5 天使对妇女说、不要害怕、我知道你们是寻找那钉十字架的耶稣。  

28:6 他不在这里、照他所说的、已经复活了。你们来看安放主的地方。  
28:7 快去告诉他的门徒说、他从死里复活了。并且在你们以先往加利利去、在那里你们要见他。看哪。我已经告诉你们了。  
28:8 妇女们就急忙离开坟墓、又害怕、又大大的欢喜、跑去要报给他的门徒。  
28:9 忽然耶稣遇见他们、说、愿你们平安。他们就上前抱住他的脚拜他。  
28:10 耶稣对他们说、不要害怕、你们去告诉我的弟兄、叫他们往加利利去、在那里必见我。  

28:11 他们去的时候、看守的兵、有几个进城去、将所经历的事、都报给祭司长。  
28:12 祭司长和长老聚集商议、就拿许多银钱给兵丁说、  
28:13 你们要这样说、夜间我们睡觉的时候、他的门徒来把他偷去了。  
28:14 倘若这话被巡抚听见、有我们劝他、保你们无事。  
28:15 兵丁受了银钱、就照所嘱咐他们的去行。这话就传说在犹太人中间、直到今日。  

28:16 十一个门徒往加利利去、到了耶稣约定的山上。  
28:17 他们见了耶稣就拜他。然而还有人疑惑。  
28:18 耶稣进前来、对他们说、天上地下所有的权柄、都赐给我了。  
28:19 所以你们要去、使万民作我的门徒、奉父子圣灵的名、给他们施洗。〔或作给他们施洗归于父子圣灵的名〕
28:20 凡我所吩咐你们的、都教训他们遵守我就常与你们同在、直到世界的末了。
