8:1 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.  
8:2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  
8:3 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.  
8:4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.  
8:5 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,  

8:6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.  
8:7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.  
8:8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.  
8:9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.  
8:10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.  

8:11 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.  
8:12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  
8:13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.  
8:14 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.  
8:15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.  

8:16 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:  
8:17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.  
8:18 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.  
8:19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.  
8:20 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.  

8:21 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  
8:22 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.  
8:23 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.  
8:24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.  
8:25 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.  

8:26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.  
8:27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
8:28 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.  
8:29 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?  
8:30 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.  

8:31 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.  
8:32 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.  
8:33 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.  
8:34 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.

8:1 耶稣下了山、有许多人跟着他。  
8:2 有一个长大痲疯的、来拜他说、主若肯、必能叫我洁净了。  
8:3 耶稣伸手摸他说、我肯、你洁净了吧。他的大痲疯立刻就洁净了。  
8:4 耶稣对他说、你切不可告诉人。只要去把身体给祭司察看、献上摩西所吩咐的礼物、对众人作证据。  
8:5 耶稣进了迦百农、有一个百夫长进前来、求他说、  

8:6 主阿、我的仆人害瘫痪病、躺在家里、甚是疼苦。  
8:7 耶稣说、我去医治他。  
8:8 百夫长回答说、主阿、你到我舍下、我不敢当。只要你说一句话、我的仆人就必好了。  
8:9 因为我在人的权下、也有兵在我以下。对这个说、去、他就去。对那个说、来、他就来。对我的仆人说、你作这事、他就去作。  
8:10 耶稣听见就希奇、对跟从的人说、我实在告诉你们、这么大的信心、就是在以色列中、我也没有遇见过。  

8:11 我又告诉你们、从东从西、将有许多人来、在天国里与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各、一同坐席。  
8:12 惟有本国的子民、竟被赶到外边黑暗里去。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。  
8:13 耶稣对百夫长说、你回去吧。照你的信心、给你成全了。那时、他的仆人就好了。  
8:14 耶稣到了彼得家里、见彼得的岳母害热病躺着。  
8:15 耶稣把他的手一摸、热就退了。他就起来服事耶稣。  

8:16 到了晚上、有人带着许多被鬼附的、来到耶稣跟前、他只用一句话、就把鬼都赶出去。并且治好了一切有病的人。  
8:17 这是要应验先知以赛亚的话、说、『他代替我们的软弱、担当我们的疾病。』  
8:18 耶稣见许多人围着他、就吩咐渡到那边去。  
8:19 有一个文士来、对他说、夫子、你无论往那里去、我要跟从你。  
8:20 耶稣说、狐狸有洞、天空的飞鸟有窝、人子却没有枕头的地方。  

8:21 又有一个门徒对耶稣说、主阿、容我先回去埋葬我的父亲。  
8:22 耶稣说、任凭死人埋葬他们的死人、你跟从我吧。  
8:23 耶稣上了船、门徒跟着他。  
8:24 海里忽然起了暴风、甚至船被波浪掩盖。耶稣却睡着了。  
8:25 门徒来叫醒了他、说、主阿、救我们、我们丧命啦。  

8:26 耶稣说、你们这小信的人哪、为甚么胆怯呢。于是起来、斥责风和海、风和海就大大的平静了。  
8:27 众人希奇说、这是怎样的人、连风和海也听从他了。  
8:28 耶稣既渡到那边去、来到加大拉人的地方、就有两个被鬼附的人、从坟茔里出来迎着他、极其凶猛、甚至没有人能从那条路上经过。  
8:29 他们喊着说、　神的儿子、我们与你有甚么相干。时候还没有到、你就上这里来叫我们受苦么。  
8:30 离他们很远、有一大群猪吃食。  

8:31 鬼就央求耶稣说、若把我们赶出去、就打发我们进入猪群吧。  
8:32 耶稣说、去吧。鬼就出来、进入猪群。全群忽然闯下山崖、投在海里淹死了。  
8:33 放猪的就逃跑进城、将这一切事、和被鬼附的人所遭遇的、都告诉人。  
8:34 合城的人、都出来迎见耶稣。既见了、就央求他离开他们的境界。
