3:1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:  
3:2 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:  
3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,  
3:4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.  
3:5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:  

3:6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:  
3:7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.  
3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.  
3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  
3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.  

3:11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,  
3:12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?  
3:13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.  
3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.  
3:15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;  

3:16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.  
3:17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.  
3:18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

3:1 亲爱的弟兄阿、我现在写给你们的是第二封信。这两封都是提醒你们、激发你们诚实的心。  
3:2 叫你们记念圣先知预先所说的话、和主救主的命令、就是使徒所传给你们的。  
3:3 第一要紧的、该知道在末世必有好讥诮的人、随从自己的私欲出来讥诮说、<a class = "sidenote">note</a>  
3:4 主要降临的应许在哪里呢。因为从列祖睡了以来、万物与起初创造的时候仍是一样。  
3:5 他们故意忘记、从太古凭　神的命有了天、并从水而出借水而成的地。  

3:6 故此、当时的世界被水淹没就消灭了。  
3:7 但现在的天地、还是凭着那命存留、直留到不敬虔之人受审判遭沉沦的日子、用火焚烧。  
3:8 亲爱的弟兄阿、有一件事你们不可忘记、就是主看一日如千年、千年如一日。  
3:9 主所应许的尚未成就、有人以为他是耽延。其实不是耽延、乃是宽容你们、不愿有一人沉沦、乃愿人人都悔改。  
3:10 但主的日子要像贼来到一样。那日天必大有响声废去、有形质的都要被烈火销化、地和其上的物都要烧尽了。  

3:11 这一切既然都要如此销化、你们为人该当怎样圣洁、怎样敬虔、  
3:12 切切仰望　神的日子来到。在那日天被火烧就销化了、有形质的都要被烈火熔化。  
3:13 但我们照他的应许、盼望新天新地、有义居在其中。  
3:14 亲爱的弟兄阿、你们既盼望这些事、就当殷勤、使自己没有玷污、无可指摘、安然见主。  
3:15 并且要以我主长久忍耐为得救的因由、就如我们所亲爱的兄弟保罗、照着所赐给他的智慧、写了信给你们。  

3:16 他一切的信上、也都是讲论这事。信中有些难明白的、那无学问不坚固的人强解、如强解别的经书一样、就自取沉沦。  
3:17 亲爱的弟兄阿、你们既然预先知道这事、就当防备、恐怕被恶人的错谬诱惑、就从自己坚固的地步上坠落。  
3:18 你们却要在我们主救主耶稣基督的恩典和知识上有长进。愿荣耀归给他、从今直到永远。阿们。
