2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.  
2:2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.  
2:3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.  
2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;  
2:5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;  

2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;  
2:7 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:  
2:8 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)
2:9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:  
2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.  

2:11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.  
2:12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;  
2:13 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;  
2:14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:  
2:15 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;  

2:16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.  
2:17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.  
2:18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.  
2:19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.  
2:20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.  

2:21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.  
2:22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.

2:1 从前在百姓中有假先知起来、将来在你们中间、也必有假师傅、私自引进陷害人的异端、连买他们的主他们也不承认、自取速速的灭亡。  
2:2 将有许多人随从他们邪淫的行为、便叫真道、因他们的缘故被毁谤。  
2:3 他们因有贪心、要用捏造的言语、在你们身上取利。他们的刑罚、自古以来并不迟延、他们的灭亡也必速速来到。〔原文作也不打盹〕  
2:4 就是天使犯了罪、　神也没有宽容、曾把他们丢在地狱、交在黑暗坑中、等候审判。  
2:5 　神也没有宽容上古的世代、曾叫洪水临到那不敬虔的世代、却保护了传义道的挪亚一家八口。  

2:6 又判定所多玛、蛾摩拉、将二城倾覆、焚烧成灰、作为后世不敬虔人的鉴戒。  
2:7 只搭救了那常为恶人淫行忧伤的义人罗得。  
2:8 因为那义人住在他们中间、看见听见他们不法的事、他的义心就天天伤痛。  
2:9 主知道搭救敬虔的人脱离试探、把不义的人留在刑罚之下、等候审判的日子。  
2:10 那些随肉身、纵污秽的情欲、轻慢主治之人的、更是如此。他们胆大任性、毁谤在尊位的也不知惧怕。  

2:11 就是天使、虽然力量权能更大、还不用毁谤的话在主面前告他们。  
2:12 但这些人好像没有灵性、生来就是畜类、以备捉拿宰杀的。他们毁谤所不晓得的事、正在败坏人的时候、自己必遭遇败坏。  
2:13 行的不义、就得了不义的工价。这些人喜爱白昼宴乐、他们已被玷污、又有瑕疵、正与你们一同坐席、就以自己的诡诈为快乐。  
2:14 他们满眼是淫色、〔淫色原文作淫妇〕止不住犯罪。引诱那心不坚固的人、心中习惯了贪婪、正是被咒诅的种类。  
2:15 他们离弃正路、就走差了、随从比珥之子巴兰的路、巴兰就是那贪爱不义之工价的先知。  

2:16 他却为自己的过犯受了责备。那不能说话的驴、以人言拦阻先知的狂妄。  
2:17 这些人是无水的井、是狂风催逼的雾气、有墨黑的幽暗为他们存留。  
2:18 他们说虚妄矜夸的大话、用肉身的情欲、和邪淫的事、引诱那些刚才脱离妄行的人。  
2:19 他们应许人得以自由、自己却作败坏的奴仆。因为人被谁制伏就是谁的奴仆。  
2:20 倘若他们因认识主救主耶稣基督、得以脱离世上的污秽、后来又在其中被缠住制伏、他们末后的景况、就比先前更不好了。  

2:21 他们晓得义路、竟背弃了传给他们的圣命、倒不如不晓得为妙。  
2:22 俗语说得真不错、狗所吐的他转过来又吃。猪洗净了又回到泥里去滚。这话在他们身上正合式。
