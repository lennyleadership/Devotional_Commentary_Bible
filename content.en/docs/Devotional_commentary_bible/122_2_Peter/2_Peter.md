2 Peter Chapter 1  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
1:1 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:  
1:2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,  
1:3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:  
1:4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.  
1:5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;  

1:6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;  
1:7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.  
1:8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
1:9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.  
1:10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:  

1:11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  
1:12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.  
1:13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;  
1:14 Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.  
1:15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.  

1:16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.  
1:17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.  
1:18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.  
1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:  
1:20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.  

1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

2 Peter Chapter 2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.  
2:2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.  
2:3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.  
2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;  
2:5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;  

2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;  
2:7 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:  
2:8 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)
2:9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:  
2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.  

2:11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.  
2:12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;  
2:13 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;  
2:14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:  
2:15 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;  

2:16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.  
2:17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.  
2:18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.  
2:19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.  
2:20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.  

2:21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.  
2:22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.

2 Peter Chapter 3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
3:1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:  
3:2 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:  
3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,  
3:4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.  
3:5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:  

3:6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:  
3:7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.  
3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.  
3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  
3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.  

3:11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,  
3:12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?  
3:13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.  
3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.  
3:15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;  

3:16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.  
3:17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.  
3:18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

彼得后书 1章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
1:1 作耶稣基督仆人和使徒的西门彼得、写信给那因我们的　神、和〔有古卷无和字〕救主耶稣基督之义、与我们同得一样宝贵信心的人。  
1:2 愿恩惠平安、因你们认识　神和我们主耶稣、多多的加给你们。  
1:3 　神的神能已将一切关乎生命和虔敬的事赐给我们、皆因我们认识那用自己荣耀和美德召我们的主。  
1:4 因此他已将又宝贵又极大的应许赐给我们、叫我们既脱离世上从情欲来的败坏、就得与　神的性情有分。  
1:5 正因这缘故、你们要分外的殷勤。有了信心、又要加上德行。有了德行、又要加上知识。  
 
1:6 有了知识、又要加上节制。有了节制、又要加上忍耐。有了忍耐、又要加上虔敬。  
1:7 有了虔敬、又要加上爱弟兄的心。有了爱弟兄的心、又要加上爱众人的心。  
1:8 你们若充充足足的有这几样、就必使你们在认识我们的主耶稣基督上、不至于闲懒不结果子了。  
1:9 人若没有这几样、就是眼瞎、只看见近处的、忘了他旧日的罪已经得了洁净。  
1:10 所以弟兄们、应当更加殷勤、使你们所蒙的恩召和拣选坚定不移。你们若行这几样、就永不失脚。  

1:11 这样、必叫你们丰丰富富的、得以进入我们主救主耶稣基督永远的国。  
1:12 你们虽然晓得这些事、并且在你们已有的真道上坚固、我却要将这些事常常提醒你们。  
1:13 我以为应当趁我还在这帐棚的时候提醒你们、激发你们。  
1:14 因为知道我脱离这帐棚的时候快到了、正如我们主耶稣基督所指示我的。  
1:15 并且我要尽心竭力、使你们在我去世以后、时常记念这些事。  

1:16 我们从前、将我们主耶稣基督的大能、和他降临的事、告诉你们、并不是随从乖巧捏造的虚言、乃是亲眼见过他的威荣。  
1:17 他从父　神得尊贵荣耀的时候、从极大荣光之中、有声音出来向他说、这是我的爱子、我所喜悦的。  
1:18 我们同他在圣山的时候、亲自听见这声音从天上出来。  
1:19 我们并有先知更确的预言、如同灯照在暗处。你们在这预言上留意、直等到天发亮晨星在你们心里出现的时候、才是好的。  
1:20 第一要紧的、该知道经上所有的预言、没有可随私意解说的。  

1:21 因为预言从来没有出于人意的、乃是人被圣灵感动说出　神的话来。

彼得后书 2章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
2:1 从前在百姓中有假先知起来、将来在你们中间、也必有假师傅、私自引进陷害人的异端、连买他们的主他们也不承认、自取速速的灭亡。  
2:2 将有许多人随从他们邪淫的行为、便叫真道、因他们的缘故被毁谤。  
2:3 他们因有贪心、要用捏造的言语、在你们身上取利。他们的刑罚、自古以来并不迟延、他们的灭亡也必速速来到。〔原文作也不打盹〕  
2:4 就是天使犯了罪、　神也没有宽容、曾把他们丢在地狱、交在黑暗坑中、等候审判。  
2:5 　神也没有宽容上古的世代、曾叫洪水临到那不敬虔的世代、却保护了传义道的挪亚一家八口。  

2:6 又判定所多玛、蛾摩拉、将二城倾覆、焚烧成灰、作为后世不敬虔人的鉴戒。  
2:7 只搭救了那常为恶人淫行忧伤的义人罗得。  
2:8 因为那义人住在他们中间、看见听见他们不法的事、他的义心就天天伤痛。  
2:9 主知道搭救敬虔的人脱离试探、把不义的人留在刑罚之下、等候审判的日子。  
2:10 那些随肉身、纵污秽的情欲、轻慢主治之人的、更是如此。他们胆大任性、毁谤在尊位的也不知惧怕。  

2:11 就是天使、虽然力量权能更大、还不用毁谤的话在主面前告他们。  
2:12 但这些人好像没有灵性、生来就是畜类、以备捉拿宰杀的。他们毁谤所不晓得的事、正在败坏人的时候、自己必遭遇败坏。  
2:13 行的不义、就得了不义的工价。这些人喜爱白昼宴乐、他们已被玷污、又有瑕疵、正与你们一同坐席、就以自己的诡诈为快乐。  
2:14 他们满眼是淫色、〔淫色原文作淫妇〕止不住犯罪。引诱那心不坚固的人、心中习惯了贪婪、正是被咒诅的种类。  
2:15 他们离弃正路、就走差了、随从比珥之子巴兰的路、巴兰就是那贪爱不义之工价的先知。  

2:16 他却为自己的过犯受了责备。那不能说话的驴、以人言拦阻先知的狂妄。  
2:17 这些人是无水的井、是狂风催逼的雾气、有墨黑的幽暗为他们存留。  
2:18 他们说虚妄矜夸的大话、用肉身的情欲、和邪淫的事、引诱那些刚才脱离妄行的人。  
2:19 他们应许人得以自由、自己却作败坏的奴仆。因为人被谁制伏就是谁的奴仆。  
2:20 倘若他们因认识主救主耶稣基督、得以脱离世上的污秽、后来又在其中被缠住制伏、他们末后的景况、就比先前更不好了。  

2:21 他们晓得义路、竟背弃了传给他们的圣命、倒不如不晓得为妙。  
2:22 俗语说得真不错、狗所吐的他转过来又吃。猪洗净了又回到泥里去滚。这话在他们身上正合式。

彼得后书 3章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
3:1 亲爱的弟兄阿、我现在写给你们的是第二封信。这两封都是提醒你们、激发你们诚实的心。  
3:2 叫你们记念圣先知预先所说的话、和主救主的命令、就是使徒所传给你们的。  
3:3 第一要紧的、该知道在末世必有好讥诮的人、随从自己的私欲出来讥诮说、  
3:4 主要降临的应许在哪里呢。因为从列祖睡了以来、万物与起初创造的时候仍是一样。  
3:5 他们故意忘记、从太古凭　神的命有了天、并从水而出借水而成的地。  

3:6 故此、当时的世界被水淹没就消灭了。  
3:7 但现在的天地、还是凭着那命存留、直留到不敬虔之人受审判遭沉沦的日子、用火焚烧。  
3:8 亲爱的弟兄阿、有一件事你们不可忘记、就是主看一日如千年、千年如一日。  
3:9 主所应许的尚未成就、有人以为他是耽延。其实不是耽延、乃是宽容你们、不愿有一人沉沦、乃愿人人都悔改。  
3:10 但主的日子要像贼来到一样。那日天必大有响声废去、有形质的都要被烈火销化、地和其上的物都要烧尽了。  

3:11 这一切既然都要如此销化、你们为人该当怎样圣洁、怎样敬虔、  
3:12 切切仰望　神的日子来到。在那日天被火烧就销化了、有形质的都要被烈火熔化。  
3:13 但我们照他的应许、盼望新天新地、有义居在其中。  
3:14 亲爱的弟兄阿、你们既盼望这些事、就当殷勤、使自己没有玷污、无可指摘、安然见主。  
3:15 并且要以我主长久忍耐为得救的因由、就如我们所亲爱的兄弟保罗、照着所赐给他的智慧、写了信给你们。  

3:16 他一切的信上、也都是讲论这事。信中有些难明白的、那无学问不坚固的人强解、如强解别的经书一样、就自取沉沦。  
3:17 亲爱的弟兄阿、你们既然预先知道这事、就当防备、恐怕被恶人的错谬诱惑、就从自己坚固的地步上坠落。  
3:18 你们却要在我们主救主耶稣基督的恩典和知识上有长进。愿荣耀归给他、从今直到永远。阿们。
