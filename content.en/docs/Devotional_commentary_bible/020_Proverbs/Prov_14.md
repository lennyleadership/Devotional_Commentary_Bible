14:1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.  
14:2 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.  
14:3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.  
14:4 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.  
14:5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.  

14:6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth.  
14:7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.  
14:8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit.  
14:9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour.  
14:10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.  

14:11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.  
14:12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.  
14:13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.  
14:14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.  
14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.  

14:16 A wise man <u class = "red"><a class = "red">feareth</a></u>, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.  
14:17 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.  
14:18 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.  
14:19 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.  
14:20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.  

14:21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he.  
14:22 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.  
14:23 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.  
14:24 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly.  
14:25 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies.  

14:26 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.  
14:27 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.  
14:28 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.  
14:29 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.  
14:30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.  

14:31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.  
14:32 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.  
14:33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.  
14:34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.  
14:35 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.

14:14 心中背道的、必满得自己的结果。善人必从自己的行为得以知足。  
14:15 愚蒙人是话都信。通达人步步谨慎。  

14:16 智慧人<u class = "red"><a class = "red">惧怕</a></u>、就远离恶事。愚妄人却狂傲自恃。  
14:17 轻易发怒的、行事愚妄。设立诡计的、被人恨恶。  
14:18 愚蒙人得愚昧为产业。通达人得知识为冠冕。  
14:19 坏人俯伏在善人面前。恶人俯伏在义人门口。

14:26 敬畏耶和华的、大有倚靠。他的儿女、也有避难所。  
14:27 敬畏耶和华、就是生命的泉源、可以使人离开死亡的网罗。  
14:28 帝王荣耀在乎民多。君王衰败在乎民少。  
14:29 不轻易发怒的、大有聪明。性情暴躁的、大显愚妄。  
14:30 心中安静、是肉体的生命。嫉妒是骨中的朽烂。  

14:31 欺压贫寒的、是辱没造他的主。怜悯穷乏的、乃是尊敬主。  
14:32 恶人在所行的恶上、必被推倒。义人临死、有所投靠。  
14:33 智慧存在聪明人心中。愚昧人心里所存的、显而易见。  
14:34 公义使邦国高举。罪恶是人民的羞辱。  
14:35 智慧的臣子、蒙王恩惠。贻羞的仆人、遭其震怒。
