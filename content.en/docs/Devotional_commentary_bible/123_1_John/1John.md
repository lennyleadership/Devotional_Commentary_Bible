1 John Chapter 1  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1:1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;  
1:2 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)
1:3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.  
1:4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.  
1:5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.  

1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:  
1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.  
1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  
1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  
1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:  
2:2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  
2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.  
2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  
2:5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.  

2:6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.  
2:7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  
2:8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.  
2:9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.  
2:10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  

2:11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.  
2:12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.  
2:13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.  
2:14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.  
2:15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  

2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  
2:17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  
2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.  
2:19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  
2:20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.  

2:21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.  
2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.  
2:23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.  
2:24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.  
2:25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.  

2:26 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.  
2:27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  
2:28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.  
2:29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.

3:1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.  
3:2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.  
3:3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.  
3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.  
3:5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.  

3:6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.  
3:7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.  
3:8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.  
3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.  
3:10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.  

3:11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.  
3:12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.  
3:13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.  
3:14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.  
3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.  

3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.  
3:17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?  
3:18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.  
3:19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.  
3:20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.  

3:21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.  
3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.  
3:23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.  
3:24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.

1 John Chapter 4  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.  
4:2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:  
4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.  
4:4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.  
4:5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.  

4:6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.  
4:7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.  
4:8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.  
4:9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.  
4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.  

4:11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.  
4:12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.  
4:13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.  
4:14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.  
4:15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.  

4:16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.  
4:17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.  
4:18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.  
4:19 We love him, because he first loved us.  
4:20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?  

4:21 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.

1 John Chapter 5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
5:1 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.  
5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.  
5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.  
5:4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.  
5:5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?  

5:6 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.  
5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.  
5:8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.  
5:9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.  
5:10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.  

5:11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  
5:12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.  
5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.  
5:14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:  
5:15 And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.  

5:16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.  
5:17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.  
5:18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.  
5:19 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.  
5:20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.  

5:21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

约翰一书 1章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

1:1 论到从起初原有的生命之道、就是我们所听见所看见、亲眼看过、亲手摸过的。  
1:2 （这生命已经显现出来、我们也看见过、现在又作见证、将原与父同在、且显现与我们那永远的生命、传给你们。)  
1:3 我们将所看见、所听见的、传给你们、使你们与我们相交、我们乃是与父并他儿子耶稣基督相交的。  
1:4 我们将这些话写给你们、使你们〔有古卷作我们〕的喜乐充足。  
1:5 　神就是光、在他毫无黑暗。这是我们从主所听见、又报给你们的信息。  

1:6 我们若说是与　神相交、却仍在黑暗里行、就是说谎话、不行真理了。  
1:7 我们若在光明中行、如同　神在光明中、就彼此相交、他儿子耶稣的血也洗净我们一切的罪。  
1:8 我们若说自己无罪、便是自欺、真理不在我们心里了。  
1:9 我们若认自己的罪、　神是信实的、是公义的、必要赦免我们的罪、洗净我们一切的不义。  
1:10 我们若说自己没有犯过罪、便是以　神为说谎的。他的道也不在我们心里了。  


* ----------------------------------------

约翰一书 2章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29

2:1 我小子们哪、我将这些话写给你们、是要叫你们不犯罪。若有人犯罪、在父那里我们有一位中保、就是那义者耶稣基督。  
2:2 他为我们的罪作了挽回祭。不是单为我们的罪、也是为普天下人的罪。  
2:3 我们若遵守他的诫命、就晓得是认识他。  
2:4 人若说我认识他、却不遵守他的诫命、便是说谎话的、真理也不在他心里了。  
2:5 凡遵守主道的、爱　神的心在他里面实在是完全的、从此我们知道我们是在主里面。  

2:6 人若说他住在主里面、就该自己照主所行的去行。  
2:7 亲爱的弟兄阿、我写给你们的、不是一条新命令、乃是你们从起初所受的旧命令。这旧命令就是你们所听见的道。  
2:8 再者、我写给你们的是一条新命令、在主是真的、在你们也是真的。因为黑暗渐渐过去、真光已经照耀。  
2:9 人若说自己在光明中、却恨他的弟兄、他到如今还是在黑暗里。  
2:10 爱弟兄的就是住在光明中、在他并没有绊跌的缘由。  

2:11 惟独恨弟兄的是在黑暗里、且在黑暗里行、也不知道往那里去、因为黑暗叫他眼睛瞎了。  
2:12 小子们哪、我写信给你们、因为你们的罪借着主名得了赦免。  
2:13 父老阿、我写信给你们、因为你们认识那从起初原有的。少年人哪、我写信给你们、因为你们胜了那恶者。小子们哪、我曾写信给你们、因为你们认识父。  
2:14 父老阿、我曾写信给你们、因为你们认识那从起初原有的。少年人哪、我曾写信给你们、因为你们刚强、　神的道常存在你们心里、你们也胜了那恶者。  
2:15 不要爱世界、和世界上的事。人若爱世界、爱父的心就不在他里面了。  

2:16 因为凡世界上的事、就像肉体的情欲、眼目的情欲、并今生的骄傲、都不是从父来的、乃是从世界来的。  
2:17 这世界、和其上的情欲、都要过去。惟独遵行　神旨意的、是永远常存。  
2:18 小子们哪、如今是末时了。你们曾听见说、那敌基督的要来、现在已经有好些敌基督的出来了。从此我们就知道如今是末时了。  
2:19 他们从我们中间出去、却不是属我们的。若是属我们的、就必仍旧与我们同在。他们出去、显明都不是属我们的。  
2:20 你们从那圣者受了恩膏、并且知道这一切的事。〔或作都有知识〕  

2:21 我写信给你们、不是因你们不知道真理、正是因你们知道、并且知道没有虚谎是从真理出来的。  
2:22 谁是说谎话的呢。不是那不认耶稣为基督的么。不认父与子的、这就是敌基督的。  
2:23 凡不认子的就没有父。认子的连父也有了。  
2:24 论到你们、务要将那从起初所听见的常存在心里。若将从起初所听见的存在心里、你们就必住在子里面、也必住在父里面。  
2:25 主所应许我们的就是永生。  

2:26 我将这些话写给你们、是指着那引诱你们的人说的。  
2:27 你们从主所受的恩膏、常存在你们心里、并不用人教训你们。自有主的恩膏在凡事上教训你们。这恩膏是真的、不是假的。你们要按这恩膏的教训、住在主里面。  
2:28 小子们哪、你们要住在主里面。这样、他若显现、我们就可以坦然无惧。当他来的时候、在他面前也不至于惭愧。  
2:29 你们若知道他是公义的、就知道凡行公义之人都是他所生的。

约翰一书 3章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24

3:1 你看父赐给我们是何等的慈爱、使我们得称为　神的儿女。我们也真是他的儿女。世人所以不认识我们、是因未曾认识他。  
3:2 亲爱的弟兄阿、我们现在是　神的儿女、将来如何、还未显明。但我们知道主若显现、我们必要像他。因为必得见他的真体。  
3:3 凡向他有这指望的、就洁净自己、像他洁净一样。  
3:4 凡犯罪的、就是违背律法。违背律法就是罪。  
3:5 你们知道主曾显现、是要除掉人的罪。在他并没有罪。  

3:6 凡住在他里面的、就不犯罪。凡犯罪的、是未曾看见他、也未曾认识他。  
3:7 小子们哪、不要被人诱惑、行义的才是义人。正如主是义的一样。  
3:8 犯罪的是属魔鬼、因为魔鬼从起初就犯罪。　神的儿子显现出来、为要除灭魔鬼的作为。  
3:9 凡从　神生的、就不犯罪、因　神的道〔原文作种〕存在他心里。他也不能犯罪、因为他是由　神生的。  
3:10 从此就显出谁是　神的儿女、谁是魔鬼的儿女。凡不行义的、就不属　神。不爱弟兄的也是如此。  

3:11 我们应当彼此相爱。这就是你们从起初所听见的命令。  
3:12 不可像该隐。他是属那恶者、杀了他的兄弟。为甚么杀了他呢。因自己的行为是恶的、兄弟的行为是善的。  
3:13 弟兄们、世人若恨你们、不要以为希奇。  
3:14 我们因为爱弟兄、就晓得是已经出死入生了。没有爱心的、仍住在死中。  
3:15 凡恨他弟兄的、就是杀人的。你们晓得凡杀人的、没有永生存在他里面。  

3:16 主为我们舍命、我们从此就知道何为爱。我们也当为弟兄舍命。  
3:17 凡有世上财物的、看见弟兄穷乏、却塞住怜恤的心、爱　神的心怎能存在他里面呢。  
3:18 小子们哪、我们相爱、不要只在言语和舌头上。总要在行为和诚实上。  
3:19 从此、就知道我们是属真理的、并且我们的心在　神面前可以安稳。  
3:20 我们的心若责备我们、　神比我们的心大、一切事没有不知道的。  

3:21 亲爱的弟兄阿、我们的心若不责备我们、就可以向　神坦然无惧了。  
3:22 并且我们一切所求的、就从他得着。因为我们遵守他的命令、行他所喜悦的事。  
3:23 　神的命令就是叫我们信他儿子耶稣基督的名、且照他所赐给我们的命令彼此相爱。  
3:24 遵守　神命令的、就住在　神里面。　神也住在他里面。我们所以知道　神住在我们里面、是因他所赐给我们的圣灵。

约翰一书 4章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

4:1 亲爱的弟兄阿、一切的灵、你们不可都信。总要试验那些灵是出于　神的不是。因为世上有许多假先知已经出来了。  
4:2 凡灵认耶稣基督是成了肉身来的、就是出于　神的。从此你们可以认出　神的灵来。  
4:3 凡灵不认耶稣、就不是出于　神。这是那敌基督者的灵。你们从前听见他要来。现在已经在世上了。  
4:4 小子们哪、你们是属　神的、并且胜了他们。因为那在你们里面的、比那在世界上的更大。  
4:5 他们是属世界的。所以论世界的事、世人也听从他们。  

4:6 我们是属　神的。认识　神的就听从我们。不属　神的就不听从我们。从此我们可以认出真理的灵、和谬妄的灵来。  
4:7 亲爱的弟兄阿、我们应当彼此相爱。因为爱是从　神来的。凡有爱心的、都是由　神而生、并且认识　神。  
4:8 没有爱心的、就不认识　神。因为　神就是爱。  
4:9 　神差他独生子到世间来、使我们借着他得生、　神爱我们的心、在此就显明了。  
4:10 不是我们爱　神、乃是　神爱我们、差他的儿子、为我们的罪作了挽回祭、这就是爱了。  

4:11 亲爱的弟兄阿、　神既是这样爱我们、我们也当彼此相爱。  
4:12 从来没有人见过　神。我们若彼此相爱、　神就住在我们里面、爱他的心在我们里面得以完全了。  
4:13 　神将他的灵赐给我们、从此就知道我们是住在他里面、他也住在我们里面。  
4:14 父差子作世人的救主、这是我们所看见且作见证的。  
4:15 凡认耶稣为　神儿子的、　神就住在他里面、他也住在　神里面。  

4:16 　神爱我们的心、我们也知道也信。　神就是爱。住在爱里面的、就是住在　神里面、　神也住在他里面。  
4:17 这样、爱在我们里面得以完全、我们就可以在审判的日子、坦然无惧。因为他如何、我们在这世上也如何。  
4:18 爱里没有惧怕。爱既完全、就把惧怕除去。因为惧怕里含着刑罚。惧怕的人在爱里未得完全。  
4:19 我们爱、因为　神先爱我们。  
4:20 人若说、我爱　神、却恨他的弟兄、就是说谎话的。不爱他所看见的弟兄、就不能爱没有看见的　神。〔有古卷作怎能爱没有看见的　神呢〕  

4:21 爱　神的、也当爱弟兄、这是我们从　神所受的命令。

约翰一书 5章  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

5:1 凡信耶稣是基督的、都是从　神而生。凡爱生他之　神的、也必爱从　神生的。  
5:2 我们若爱　神、又遵守他的诫命、从此就知道我们爱　神的儿女。  
5:3 我们遵守　神的诫命、这就是爱他了。并且他的诫命不是难守的。  
5:4 因为凡从　神生的、就胜过世界。使我们胜了世界的、就是我们的信心。  
5:5 胜过世界的是谁呢。不是那信耶稣是　神儿子的么。  

5:6 这借着水和血而来的就是耶稣基督。不是单用水、乃是用水又用血。  
5:7 并且有圣灵作见证、因为圣灵就是真理。  
5:8 作见证的原来有三、就是圣灵、水、与血这三样也都归于一。  
5:9 我们既领受人的见证、　神的见证更该领受了。〔该领受原文作大〕因　神的见证、是为他儿子作的。  
5:10 信　神儿子的、就有这见证在他心里。不信　神的、就是将　神当作说谎的。因不信　神为他儿子作的见证。  

5:11 这见证、就是　神赐给我们永生、这永生也是在他儿子里面。  
5:12 人有了　神的儿子就有生命。没有　神的儿子就没有生命。  
5:13 我将这些话写给你们信奉　神儿子之名的人、要叫你们知道自己有永生。  
5:14 我们若照他的旨意求甚么、他就听我们。这是我们向他所存坦然无惧的心。  
5:15 既然知道他听我们一切所求的、就知道我们所求于他的无不得着。  

5:16 人若看见弟兄犯了不至于死的罪、就当为他祈求、　神必将生命赐给他。有至于死的罪、我不说当为这罪祈求。  
5:17 凡不义的事都是罪。也有不至于死的罪。  
5:18 我们知道凡从　神生的必不犯罪。从　神生的必保守自己、〔有古卷作那从　神生的必保护他〕那恶者也就无法害他。  
5:19 我们知道我们是属　神的、全世界都卧在那恶者手下。  
5:20 我们也知道　神的儿子已经来到、且将智慧赐给我们、使我们认识那位真实的、我们也在那位真实的里面、就是在他儿子耶稣基督里面。这是真　神、也是永生。  

5:21 小子们哪、你们要自守、远避偶像。
