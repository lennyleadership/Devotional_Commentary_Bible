2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:  
2:2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  
2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.  
2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  
2:5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.  

2:6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.  
2:7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  
2:8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.  
2:9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.  
2:10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  

2:11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.  
2:12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.  
2:13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.  
2:14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.  
2:15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  

2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  
2:17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  
2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.  
2:19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  
2:20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.  

2:21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.  
2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.  
2:23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.  
2:24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.  
2:25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.  

2:26 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.  
2:27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  
2:28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.  
2:29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.

2:1 我小子们哪、我将这些话写给你们、是要叫你们不犯罪。若有人犯罪、在父那里我们有一位中保、就是那义者耶稣基督。  
2:2 他为我们的罪作了挽回祭。不是单为我们的罪、也是为普天下人的罪。  
2:3 我们若遵守他的诫命、就晓得是认识他。  
2:4 人若说我认识他、却不遵守他的诫命、便是说谎话的、真理也不在他心里了。  
2:5 凡遵守主道的、爱　神的心在他里面实在是完全的、从此我们知道我们是在主里面。  

2:6 人若说他住在主里面、就该自己照主所行的去行。  
2:7 亲爱的弟兄阿、我写给你们的、不是一条新命令、乃是你们从起初所受的旧命令。这旧命令就是你们所听见的道。  
2:8 再者、我写给你们的是一条新命令、在主是真的、在你们也是真的。因为黑暗渐渐过去、真光已经照耀。  
2:9 人若说自己在光明中、却恨他的弟兄、他到如今还是在黑暗里。  
2:10 爱弟兄的就是住在光明中、在他并没有绊跌的缘由。  

2:11 惟独恨弟兄的是在黑暗里、且在黑暗里行、也不知道往那里去、因为黑暗叫他眼睛瞎了。  
2:12 小子们哪、我写信给你们、因为你们的罪借着主名得了赦免。  
2:13 父老阿、我写信给你们、因为你们认识那从起初原有的。少年人哪、我写信给你们、因为你们胜了那恶者。小子们哪、我曾写信给你们、因为你们认识父。  
2:14 父老阿、我曾写信给你们、因为你们认识那从起初原有的。少年人哪、我曾写信给你们、因为你们刚强、　神的道常存在你们心里、你们也胜了那恶者。  
2:15 不要爱世界、和世界上的事。人若爱世界、爱父的心就不在他里面了。  

2:16 因为凡世界上的事、就像肉体的情欲、眼目的情欲、并今生的骄傲、都不是从父来的、乃是从世界来的。  
2:17 这世界、和其上的情欲、都要过去。惟独遵行　神旨意的、是永远常存。  
2:18 小子们哪、如今是末时了。你们曾听见说、那敌基督的要来、现在已经有好些敌基督的出来了。从此我们就知道如今是末时了。  
2:19 他们从我们中间出去、却不是属我们的。若是属我们的、就必仍旧与我们同在。他们出去、显明都不是属我们的。  
2:20 你们从那圣者受了恩膏、并且知道这一切的事。〔或作都有知识〕  

2:21 我写信给你们、不是因你们不知道真理、正是因你们知道、并且知道没有虚谎是从真理出来的。  
2:22 谁是说谎话的呢。不是那不认耶稣为基督的么。不认父与子的、这就是敌基督的。  
2:23 凡不认子的就没有父。认子的连父也有了。  
2:24 论到你们、务要将那从起初所听见的常存在心里。若将从起初所听见的存在心里、你们就必住在子里面、也必住在父里面。  
2:25 主所应许我们的就是永生。  

2:26 我将这些话写给你们、是指着那引诱你们的人说的。  
2:27 你们从主所受的恩膏、常存在你们心里、并不用人教训你们。自有主的恩膏在凡事上教训你们。这恩膏是真的、不是假的。你们要按这恩膏的教训、住在主里面。  
2:28 小子们哪、你们要住在主里面。这样、他若显现、我们就可以坦然无惧。当他来的时候、在他面前也不至于惭愧。  
2:29 你们若知道他是公义的、就知道凡行公义之人都是他所生的。
