13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
13:2 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.  
13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.  
13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.  
13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.  

13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.  
13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.  
13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.  
13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.  
13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.  

13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,  
13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.  
13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.  
13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:  
13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.  

13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.  
13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:  
13:18 But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.  
13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.  
13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.  

13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:  
13:22 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

13:1 耶和华晓谕摩西说、
13:2 以色列中凡头生的、无论是人是牲畜、都是我的、要分别为圣归我。  
13:3 摩西对百姓说、你们要记念从埃及为奴之家出来的这日、因为耶和华用大能的手将你们从这地方领出来。  有酵的饼都不可吃。  
13:4 亚笔月间的这日、是你们出来的日子。  
13:5 将来耶和华领你进迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、希未人、耶布斯人之地、就是他向你的祖宗起誓应许给你那流奶与蜜之地、那时你要在这月间守这礼。  

13:6 你要吃无酵饼七日、到第七日要向耶和华守节。  
13:7 这七日之久、要吃无酵饼、在你四境之内不可见有酵的饼、也不可见发酵的物。  
13:8 当那日、你要告诉你的儿子说、这是因耶和华在我出埃及的时候为我所行的事。  
13:9 这要在你手上作记号、在你额上作记念、使耶和华的律法常在你口中、因为耶和华曾用大能的手将你从埃及领出来。  
13:10 所以你每年要按着日期守这例。  

13:11 将来耶和华照他向你和你祖宗所起的誓、将你领进迦南人之地、把这地赐给你、
13:12 那时你要将一切头生的、并牲畜中头生的、归给耶和华。  公的都要属耶和华。  
13:13 凡头生的驴、你要用羊羔代赎、若不代赎、就要打折他的颈项。  凡你儿子中头生的都要赎出来。  
13:14 日后、你的儿子问你说、这是甚么意思、你就说、耶和华用大能的手将我们从埃及为奴之家领出来。  
13:15 那时法老几乎不容我们去、耶和华就把埃及地所有头生的、无论是人是牲畜、都杀了、因此我把一切头生的公牲畜献给耶和华为祭、但将头生的儿子都赎出来。  

13:16 这要在你手上作记号、在你额上作经文、因为耶和华用大能的手将我们从埃及领出来。  
13:17 法老容百姓去的时候、非利士地的道路虽近、　神却不领他们从那里走、因为　神说、恐怕百姓遇见打仗后悔、就回埃及去。  
13:18 所以　神领百姓绕道而行、走红海旷野的路。  以色列人出埃及地、都带着兵器上去。  
13:19 摩西把约瑟的骸骨一同带去、因为约瑟曾叫以色列人严严的起誓、对他们说、　神必眷顾你们、你们要把我的骸骨从这里一同带上去。  
13:20 他们从疏割起行、在旷野边的以倘安营。  

13:21 日间耶和华在云柱中领他们的路、夜间在火柱中光照他们、使他们日夜都可以行走。  
13:22 日间云柱、夜间火柱、总不离开百姓的面前。
