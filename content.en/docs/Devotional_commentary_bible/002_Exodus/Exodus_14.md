14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
14:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.  
14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.  
14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.  
14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?  

14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:  
14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.  
14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.  
14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.  
14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.  

14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  
14:12 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.  
14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.  
14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.  
14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:  

14:16 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.  
14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.  
14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.  
14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:  
14:20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.  

14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.  
14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.  
14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.  
14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,  
14:25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.  

14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.  
14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.  
14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.  
14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.  
14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.  

14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.

14:1 耶和华晓谕摩西说、
14:2 你吩咐以色列人转回、安营在比哈希录前、密夺和海的中间、对着巴力洗分靠近海边安营。  
14:3 法老必说、以色列人在地中绕迷了、旷野把他们困住了。  
14:4 我要使法老的心刚硬、他要追赶他们、我便在法老和他全军身上得荣耀、埃及人就知道我是耶和华。  于是以色列人这样行了。  
14:5 有人告诉埃及王说、百姓逃跑、法老和他的臣仆就向百姓变心、说、我们容以色列人去不再服事我们、这作的是甚么事呢。  

14:6 法老就预备他的车辆、带领军兵同去。  
14:7 并带着六百辆特选的车、和埃及所有的车、每辆都有车兵长。  
14:8 耶和华使埃及王法老的心刚硬、他就追赶以色列人、因为以色列人是昂然无惧的出埃及。  
14:9 埃及人追赶他们。  法老一切的马匹、车辆、马兵、与军兵、就在海边上靠近比哈希录对着巴力洗分、在他们安营的地方追上了。  
14:10 法老临近的时候、以色列人举目看见埃及人赶来、就甚惧怕、向耶和华哀求。  

14:11 他们对摩西说、难道在埃及没有坟地、你把我们带来死在旷野么、你为甚么这样待我们、将我们从埃及领出来呢。  
14:12 我们在埃及岂没有对你说过、不要搅扰我们、容我们服事埃及人么、因为服事埃及人比死在旷野还好。  
14:13 摩西对百姓说、不要惧怕、只管站住、看耶和华今天向你们所要施行的救恩、因为你们今天所看见的埃及人、必永远不再看见了。  
14:14 耶和华必为你们争战、你们只管静默、不要作声。  
14:15 耶和华对摩西说、你为甚么向我哀求呢、你吩咐以色列人往前走。  

14:16 你举手向海伸杖、把水分开。  以色列人要下海中走干地。  
14:17 我要使埃及人的心刚硬、他们就跟着下去、我要在法老和他的全军、车辆、马兵上得荣耀。  
14:18 我在法老、和他的车辆、马兵上、得荣耀的时候、埃及人就知道我是耶和华了。  
14:19 在以色列营前行走　神的使者、转到他们后边去、云柱也从他们前边转到他们后边立住。  
14:20 在埃及营和以色列营中间有云柱、一边黑暗、一边发光、终夜两下不得相近。  

14:21 摩西向海伸杖、耶和华便用大东风、使海水一夜退去、水便分开、海就成了干地。  
14:22 以色列人下海中走干地、水在他们的左右作了墙垣。  
14:23 埃及人追赶他们、法老一切的马匹、车辆、和马兵、都跟着下到海中。  
14:24 到了晨更的时候、耶和华从云火柱中向埃及的军兵观看、使埃及的军兵混乱了。  
14:25 又使他们的车轮脱落、难以行走、以致埃及人说、我们从以色列人面前逃跑吧、因耶和华为他们攻击我们了。  

14:26 耶和华对摩西说、你向海伸杖、叫水仍合在埃及人并他们的车辆、马兵身上。  
14:27 摩西就向海伸杖、到了天一亮、海水仍旧复原、埃及人避水逃跑的时候、耶和华把他们推翻在海中。  
14:28 水就回流、淹没了车辆、和马兵。  那些跟着以色列人下海法老的全军、连一个也没有剩下。  
14:29 以色列人却在海中走干地、水在他们的左右作了墙垣。  
14:30 当日耶和华这样拯救以色列人脱离埃及人的手、以色列人看见埃及人的死尸都在海边了。  

14:31 以色列人看见耶和华向埃及人所行的大事、就敬畏耶和华、又信服他和他的仆人摩西。
