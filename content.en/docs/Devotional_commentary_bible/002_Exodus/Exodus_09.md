9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  
9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,  
9:3 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.  
9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.  
9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.  

9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.  
9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.  
9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.  
9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.  
9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.  

9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.  
9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.  
9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  
9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.  
9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.  

9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.  
9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?  
9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.  
9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.  
9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:  

9:21 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.  
9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.  
9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.  
9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.  
9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.  

9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.  
9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.  
9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.  
9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.  
9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.  

9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.  
9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.  
9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.  
9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.  
9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

9:1 耶和华吩咐摩西说、你进去见法老、对他说、耶和华希伯来人的　神这样说、容我的百姓去、好事奉我。  
9:2 你若不肯容他们去、仍旧强留他们、
9:3 耶和华的手加在你田间的牲畜上、就是在马、驴、骆驼、牛群、羊群上、必有重重的瘟疫。  
9:4 耶和华要分别以色列的牲畜和埃及的牲畜、凡属以色列人的、一样都不死。  
9:5 耶和华就定了时候、说、明天耶和华必在此地行这事。  

9:6 第二天耶和华就行这事、埃及的牲畜几乎都死了、只是以色列人的牲畜一个都没有死。  
9:7 法老打发人去看、谁知、以色列人的牲畜连一个都没有死。  法老的心却是固执、不容百姓去。  
9:8 耶和华吩咐摩西亚伦说、你们取几捧炉灰、摩西要在法老面前向天扬起来。  
9:9 这灰要在埃及全地变作尘土、在人身上和牲畜身上、成了起泡的疮。  
9:10 摩西亚伦取了炉灰、站在法老面前。  摩西向天扬起来、就在人身上和牲畜身上、成了起泡的疮。  

9:11 行法术的在摩西面前站立不住、因为在他们身上、和一切埃及人身上、都有这疮。  
9:12 耶和华使法老的心刚硬、不听他们、正如耶和华对摩西所说的。  
9:13 耶和华对摩西说、你清早起来、站在法老面前、对他说、耶和华希伯来人的　神、这样说、容我的百姓去、好事奉我。  
9:14 因为这一次我要叫一切的灾殃临到你、和你臣仆、并你百姓的身上、叫你知道在普天下没有像我的。  
9:15 我若伸手用瘟疫攻击你和你的百姓、你早就从地上除灭了。  

9:16 其实我叫你存立、是特要向你显我的大能、并要使我的名传遍天下。  
9:17 你还向我的百姓自高、不容他们去么。  
9:18 到明天约在这时候、我必叫重大的冰雹降下、自从埃及开国以来、没有这样的冰雹。  
9:19 现在你要打发人把你的牲畜、和你田间一切所有的催进来、凡在田间不收回家的、无论是人是牲畜、冰雹必降在他们身上、他们就必死。  
9:20 法老的臣仆中惧怕耶和华这话的、便叫他的奴仆和牲畜、跑进家来。  

9:21 但那不把耶和华这话放在心上的、就将他的奴仆和牲畜、留在田里。  
9:22 耶和华对摩西说、你向天伸杖、使埃及遍地的人身上、和牲畜身上、并田间各样菜蔬上、都有冰雹。  
9:23 摩西向天伸杖、耶和华就打雷下雹、有火闪到地上、耶和华下雹在埃及地上。  
9:24 那时、雹与火搀杂、甚是利害、自从埃及成国以来、遍地没有这样的。  
9:25 在埃及遍地、雹击打了田间所有的人和牲畜、并一切的菜蔬、又打坏田间一切的树木。  

9:26 惟独以色列人所住的歌珊地、没有冰雹。  
9:27 法老打发人召摩西亚伦来、对他们说、这一次我犯了罪了、耶和华是公义的、我和我的百姓是邪恶的。  
9:28 这雷轰和冰雹已经够了、请你们求耶和华、我就容你们去、不再留住你们。  
9:29 摩西对他说、我一出城、就要向耶和华举手祷告、雷必止住、也不再有冰雹、叫你知道全地都是属耶和华的。  
9:30 至于你和你的臣仆、我知道你们还是不惧怕耶和华　神。  

9:31 那时、麻和大麦被雹击打、因为大麦已经吐穗、麻也开了花。  
9:32 只是小麦和粗麦没有被击打、因为还没有长成。  
9:33 摩西离了法老出城、向耶和华举手祷告、雷和雹就止住、雨也不再浇在地上了。  
9:34 法老见雨和雹与雷止住、就越发犯罪、他和他的臣仆都硬着心。  
9:35 法老的心刚硬、不容以色列人去、正如耶和华借着摩西所说的。
