18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;  
18:2 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,  
18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:  
18:4 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:  
18:5 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:  

18:6 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.  
18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.  
18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.  
18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.  
18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.  

18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.  
18:12 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.  
18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.  
18:14 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?  
18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:  

18:16 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.  
18:17 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.  
18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.  
18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:  
18:20 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.  

18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:  
18:22 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.  
18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.  
18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.  
18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  

18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.  
18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

18:1 摩西的岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗、听见　神为摩西和　神的百姓以色列所行的一切事、就是耶和华将以色列从埃及领出来的事。  
18:2 便带着摩西的妻子西坡拉、就是摩西从前打发回去的。  
18:3 又带着西坡拉的两个儿子、一个名叫革舜、因为摩西说、我在外邦作了寄居的。  
18:4 一个名叫以利以谢、因为他说、我父亲的　神帮助了我、救我脱离法老的刀。  
18:5 摩西的岳父叶忒罗带着摩西的妻子和两个儿子、来到　神的山、就是摩西在旷野安营的地方。  

18:6 他对摩西说、我是你岳父叶忒罗、带着你的妻子和两个儿子、来到你这里。  
18:7 摩西迎接他的岳父、向他下拜、与他亲嘴、彼此问安、都进了帐棚。  
18:8 摩西将耶和华为以色列的缘故向法老和埃及人所行的一切事、以及路上所遭遇的一切艰难、并耶和华怎样搭救他们、都述说与他岳父听。  
18:9 叶忒罗因耶和华待以色列的一切好处、就是拯救他们脱离埃及人的手、便甚欢喜。  
18:10 叶忒罗说、耶和华是应当称颂的、他救了你们脱离埃及人和法老的手、将这百姓从埃及人的手下救出来。  

18:11 我现今在埃及人向这百姓发狂傲的事上、得知耶和华比万神都大。  
18:12 摩西的岳父叶忒罗、把燔祭和平安祭献给　神。  亚伦和以色列的众长老都来了、与摩西的岳父在　神面前吃饭。  
18:13 第二天摩西坐着审判百姓、百姓从早到晚都站在摩西的左右。  
18:14 摩西的岳父看见他向百姓所作的一切事、就说、你向百姓作的是甚么事呢、你为甚么独自坐着、众百姓从早到晚都站在你的左右呢。  
18:15 摩西对岳父说、这是因百姓到我这里来求问　神。  

18:16 他们有事的时候、就到我这里来、我便在两造之间施行审判。  我又叫他们知道　神的律例、和法度。  
18:17 摩西的岳父说、你这作的不好。  
18:18 你和这些百姓必都疲惫、因为这事太重、你独自一人办理不了。  
18:19 现在你要听我的话、我为你出个主意、愿　神与你同在。  你要替百姓到　神面前、将案件奏告　神。  
18:20 又要将律例和法度教训他们、指示他们当行的道、当作的事。  

18:21 并要从百姓中拣选有才能的人、就是敬畏　神、诚实无妄、恨不义之财的人、派他们作千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长、管理百姓。  
18:22 叫他们随时审判百姓、大事都要呈到你这里、小事他们自己可以审判。  这样、你就轻省些、他们也可以同当此任。  
18:23 你若这样行、　神也这样吩咐你、你就能受得住、这百姓也都平平安安归回他们的住处。  
18:24 于是摩西听从他岳父的话、按着他所说的去行。  
18:25 摩西从以色列人中拣选了有才能的人、立他们为百姓的首领、作千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长。  

18:26 他们随时审判百姓、有难断的案件、就呈到摩西那里、但各样小事他们自己审判。  
18:27 此后、摩西让他的岳父去、他就往本地去了。
