31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
31:2 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:  
31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,  
31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,  
31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.  

31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;  
31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,  
31:8 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,  
31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,  
31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,  

31:11 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.  
31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
31:13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.  
31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.  
31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.  

31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.  
31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.  
31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.

31:1 耶和华晓谕摩西说。  
31:2 看哪、犹大支派中户珥的孙子、乌利的儿子比撒列、我已经提他的名召他。  
31:3 我也以我的灵充满了他、使他有智慧、有聪明、有知识、能作各样的工、
31:4 能想出巧工、用金银铜制造各物。  
31:5 又能刻宝石、可以镶嵌。  能雕刻木头、能作各样的工。  

31:6 我分派但支派中亚希撒抹的儿子亚何利亚伯、与他同工、凡心里有智慧的、我更使他们有智慧、能作我一切所吩咐的、
31:7 就是会幕、和法柜、并其上的施恩座、与会幕中一切的器具。  
31:8 桌子、和桌子的器具、精金的灯台、和灯台的一切器具、并香坛、
31:9 燔祭坛、和坛的一切器具、并洗濯盆、与盆座、
31:10 精工作的礼服、和祭司亚伦、并他儿子用以供祭司职分的圣衣、

31:11 膏油、和为圣所用馨香的香料、他们都要照我一切所吩咐的去作。  
31:12 耶和华晓谕摩西说、
31:13 你要吩咐以色列人说、你们务要守我的安息日、因为这是你我之间世世代代的证据、使你们知道我耶和华是叫你们成为圣的。  
31:14 所以你们要守安息日、以为圣日、凡干犯这日的、必要把他治死。  凡在这日作工的、必从民中剪除。  
31:15 六日要作工、但第七日是安息圣日、是向耶和华守为圣的、凡在安息日作工的、必要把他治死。  

31:16 故此、以色列人要世世代代守安息日为永远的约。  
31:17 这是我和以色列人永远的证据、因为六日之内耶和华造天地、第七日便安息舒畅。  
31:18 耶和华在西乃山和摩西说完了话、就把两块法版交给他、是　神用指头写的石版。
