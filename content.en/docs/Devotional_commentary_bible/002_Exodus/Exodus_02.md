2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.  
2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.  
2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an <a class = "red">ark</a> of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. <a class = "marginnote">v3: it is ark in KJV translation, which is the same word for Noah's ark.</a>  
2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.  
2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.  

2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.  
2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?  
2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.  
2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.  
2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.  

2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.  
2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.  
2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  
2:14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.  
2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.  

2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.  
2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.  
2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?  
2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.  
2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.  

2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.  
2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.  
2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.  
2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.  
2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.

2:1 有一个利未家的人、娶了一个利未女子为妻。  
2:2 那女人怀孕、生一个儿子、见他俊美就藏了他三个月。  
2:3 后来不能再藏、就取了一个蒲草箱、抹上石漆和石油、将孩子放在里头、把箱子搁在河边的芦荻中。  
2:4 孩子的姐姐远远站着、要知道他究竟怎么样。  
2:5 法老的女儿来到河边洗澡、他的使女们在河边行走。  他看见箱子在芦荻中、就打发一个婢女拿来。  

2:6 他打开箱子看见那孩子、孩子哭了、他就可怜他、说、这是希伯来人的一个孩子。  
2:7 孩子的姐姐对法老的女儿说、我去在希伯来妇人中叫一个奶妈来、为你奶这孩子、可以不可以。  
2:8 法老的女儿说、可以。  童女就去叫了孩子的母亲来。  
2:9 法老的女儿对他说、你把这孩子抱去、为我奶他、我必给你工价。  妇人就抱了孩子去奶他。  
2:10 孩子渐长、妇人把他带到法老的女儿那里、就作了他的儿子。他给孩子起名叫摩西、意思说、因我把他从水里拉出来。<a id="1_ref" href = "#1" class = "index">[1]</a>  

2:11 后来摩西长大、他出去到他弟兄那里、看他们的重担、见一个埃及人打希伯来人的一个弟兄。  
2:12 他左右观看、见没有人、就把埃及人打死了、藏在沙土里。  
2:13 第二天他出去见有两个希伯来人争斗、就对那欺负人的说、你为甚么打你同族的人呢。  
2:14 那人说、谁立你作我们的首领和审判官呢、难道你要杀我、像杀那埃及人么。摩西便惧怕、说、这事必是被人知道了。  
2:15 法老听见这事、就想杀摩西、但摩西躲避法老逃往米甸地居住。  

2:16 一日他在井旁坐下、米甸的祭司有七个女儿、他们来打水、打满了槽、要饮父亲的群羊。  
2:17 有牧羊的人来把他们赶走了、摩西却起来帮助他们、又饮了他们的群羊。  
2:18 他们来到父亲流珥那里、他说、今日你们为何来得这么快呢。  
2:19 他们说、有一个埃及人救我们脱离牧羊人的手、并且为我们打水饮了群羊。  
2:20 他对女儿们说、那个人在那里、你们为甚么撇下他呢、你们去请他来吃饭。  

2:21 摩西甘心和那人同住。  那人把他的女儿西坡拉给摩西为妻。  
2:22 西坡拉生了一个儿子、摩西给他起名叫革舜、意思说、因我在外邦作了寄居的。  
2:23 过了多年、埃及王死了。  以色列人因作苦工、就叹息哀求、他们的哀声达于　神。  
2:24 　神听见他们的哀声、就记念他与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所立的约。  
2:25 　神看顾以色列人、也知道他们的苦情。

<br>摩西的「出来」  
<br>[出二 10]「她给孩子起名叫摩西，意思说：因我把他从水里拉出来。  
<br>摩西的意思乃是「出来」。这「出来」二字，便可以把摩西一生的历史包括尽了。起初他是由水里「出来」到王宫里；等到长大了，他又蒙引导「出来」，离开那属世的环境到旷野去，独自与神交通；后来神把他从旷野带「出来」，成为神的器皿，去带领以色列百姓出埃及。再后他又被召离开他的工作，由帐幕里「出来」到山上去与神有更亲密的交通；最后他就由这世界「出来」，到那永生神的怀抱里。
