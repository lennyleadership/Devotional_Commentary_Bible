8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  
8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:  
8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:  
8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.  
8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.  

8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.  
8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.  
8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.  
8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?  
8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.  

8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.  
8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.  
8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.  
8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.  
8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.  

8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.  
8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.  
8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.  
8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.  
8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  

8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.  
8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.  
8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.  
8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.  
8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.  

8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?  
8:27 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.  
8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.  
8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.  
8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.  

8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.  
8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.

8:1 耶和华吩咐摩西说、你进去见法老、对他说、耶和华这样说、容我的百姓去、好事奉我。  
8:2 你若不肯容他们去、我必使青蛙糟蹋你的四境。  
8:3 河里要滋生青蛙、这青蛙要上来进你的宫殿、和你的卧房、上你的床榻、进你臣仆的房屋、上你百姓的身上、进你的炉灶、和你的抟面盆。  
8:4 又要上你和你百姓并你众臣仆的身上。  
8:5 耶和华晓谕摩西说、你对亚伦说、把你的杖伸在江、河、池以上、使青蛙到埃及地上来。  

8:6 亚伦便伸杖在埃及的诸水以上、青蛙就上来遮满了埃及地。  
8:7 行法术的也用他们的邪术照样而行、叫青蛙上了埃及地。  
8:8 法老召了摩西亚伦来说、请你们求耶和华使这青蛙离开我和我的民、我就容百姓去祭祀耶和华。  
8:9 摩西对法老说、任凭你吧、我要何时为你和你的臣仆、并你的百姓、祈求除灭青蛙离开你和你的宫殿、只留在河里呢。  
8:10 他说、明天、摩西说、可以照你的话吧、好叫你知道没有像耶和华我们　神的。  

8:11 青蛙要离开你和你的宫殿、并你的臣仆与你的百姓、只留在河里。  
8:12 于是摩西亚伦离开法老出去。  摩西为扰害法老的青蛙呼求耶和华。  
8:13 耶和华就照摩西的话行、凡在房里、院中、田间的青蛙都死了。  
8:14 众人把青蛙聚拢成堆、遍地就都腥臭。  
8:15 但法老见灾祸松缓、就硬着心不肯听他们、正如耶和华所说的。  

8:16 耶和华吩咐摩西说、你对亚伦说、伸出你的杖击打地上的尘土、使尘土在埃及遍地变作虱子。  〔或作虼蚤下同〕。  
8:17 他们就这样行。  亚伦伸杖击打地上的尘土、就在人身上和牲畜身上有了虱子、埃及遍地的尘土、都变成虱子了。  
8:18 行法术的也用邪术要生出虱子来、却是不能。  于是在人身上、和牲畜身上、都有了虱子。  
8:19 行法术的就对法老说、这是　神的手段。  法老心里刚硬、不肯听摩西亚伦、正如耶和华所说的。  
8:20 耶和华对摩西说、你清早起来、法老来到水边、你站在他面前、对他说、耶和华这样说、容我的百姓去、好事奉我。  

8:21 你若不容我的百姓去、我要叫成群的苍蝇到你和你臣仆、并你百姓的身上、进你的房屋。  并且埃及人的房屋、和他们所住的地、都要满了成群的苍蝇。  
8:22 当那日我必分别我百姓所住的歌珊地、使那里没有成群的苍蝇、好叫你知道我是天下的耶和华。  
8:23 我要将我的百姓和你的百姓分别出来。  明天必有这神迹。  
8:24 耶和华就这样行、苍蝇成了大群、进入法老的宫殿、和他臣仆的房屋。  埃及遍地、就因这成群的苍蝇败坏了。  
8:25 法老召了摩西亚伦来、说、你们去、在这地祭祀你们的　神吧。  

8:26 摩西说、这样行本不相宜、因为我们要把埃及人所厌恶的祭祀耶和华我们的　神。  若把埃及人所厌恶的在他们眼前献为祭、他们岂不拿石头打死我们么。  
8:27 我们要往旷野去、走三天的路程、照着耶和华我们　神所要吩咐我们的、祭祀他。  
8:28 法老说、我容你们去在旷野祭祀耶和华你们的　神、只是不要走得很远。  求你们为我祈祷。  
8:29 摩西说、我要出去求耶和华、使成群的苍蝇明天离开法老、和法老的臣仆、并法老的百姓、法老却不可再行诡诈、不容百姓去祭祀耶和华。  
8:30 于是摩西离开法老去求耶和华。  

8:31 耶和华就照摩西的话行、叫成群的苍蝇离开法老、和他的臣仆、并他的百姓、一个也没有留下。  
8:32 这一次法老又硬着心、不容百姓去。
