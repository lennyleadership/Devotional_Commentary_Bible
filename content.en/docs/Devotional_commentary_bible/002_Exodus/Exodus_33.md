33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:  
33:2 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:  
33:3 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.  
33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.  
33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.  

33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.  
33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.  
33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.  
33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.  
33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.  

33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.  
33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.  
33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.  
33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.  
33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.  

33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.  
33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.  
33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.  
33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.  
33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.  

33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:  
33:22 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:  
33:23 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.

33:1 耶和华吩咐摩西说、我曾起誓应许亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各说、要将迦南地赐给你的后裔。  现在你和你从埃及地所领出来的百姓、要从这里往那地去。  
33:2 我要差遣使者在你前面、撵出迦南人、亚摩利人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人、
33:3 领你到那流奶与蜜之地。  我自己不同你们上去、因为你们是硬着颈项的百姓、恐怕我在路上把你们灭绝。  
33:4 百姓听见这凶信就悲哀、也没有人佩戴妆饰。  
33:5 耶和华对摩西说、你告诉以色列人说、耶和华说、你们是硬着颈项的百姓、我若一霎时临到你们中间、必灭绝你们现在你们要把身上的妆饰摘下来、使我可以知道怎样待你们。  

33:6 以色列人从住何烈山以后、就把身上的妆饰摘得干净。  
33:7 摩西素常将帐棚支搭在营外、离营却远、他称这帐棚为会幕。  凡求问耶和华的、就到营外的会幕那里去。  
33:8 当摩西出营到会幕去的时候、百姓就都起来、各人站在自己帐棚的门口、望着摩西、直等到他进了会幕。  
33:9 摩西进会幕的时候、云柱降下来、立在会幕的门前、耶和华便与摩西说话。  
33:10 众百姓看见云柱立在会幕门前、就都起来各人在自己帐棚的门口下拜。  

33:11 耶和华与摩西面对面说话、好像人与朋友说话一般。摩西转到营里去、惟有他的帮手一个少年人嫩的儿子约书亚、不离开会幕。<a id="1_ref" href = "#1" class ="index">[1]</a>  
33:12 摩西对耶和华说、你吩咐我说、将这百姓领上去、却没有叫我知道你要打发谁与我同去、只说、我按你的名认识你、你在我眼前也蒙了恩。  
33:13 我如今若在你眼前蒙恩、求你将你的道指示我、使我可以认识你、好在你眼前蒙恩。  求你想到这民是你的民。  
33:14 耶和华说、我必亲自和你同去、使你得安息。  
33:15 摩西说、你若不亲自和我同去、就不要把我们从这里领上去。  

33:16 人在何事上得以知道我和你的百姓、在你眼前蒙恩呢、岂不是因你与我们同去、使我和你的百姓、与地上的万民有分别么。  
33:17 耶和华对摩西说、你这所求的我也要行、因为你在我眼前蒙了恩、并且我按你的名认识你。  
33:18 摩西说、求你显出你的荣耀给我看。  
33:19 耶和华说、我要显我一切的恩慈、在你面前经过、宣告我的名。我要恩待谁、就恩待谁。要怜悯谁、就怜悯谁。  
33:20 又说、你不能看见我的面、因为人见我的面不能存活。  

33:21 耶和华说、看哪、在我这里有地方、你要站在磐石上。  
33:22 我的荣耀经过的时候、我必将你放在磐石穴中、用我的手遮掩你、等我过去。  
33:23 然后我要将我的手收回、你就得见我的背、却不得见我的面。

<br>忠诚顺服    
<br>[出三十三 11]「耶和华与摩西面对面说话，好像人与朋友说话一般。」    
<br>我们必须像摩西那样忠诚顺服，才有与神面对面交通的可能。亚伯拉罕称为神的朋友，必曾经过许多交战，流过许多眼泪;看他如何在无可盼望中，仍相信神的应许，便知他的艰难了。摩西为以色列人所受的苦，和他与法老的谈判，以及他对于神的忠诚，何尝不也是艰难的呢?凡真实与神面对面交通的人，他们对神的忠诚，皆须绝对无可指摘，他们的信心必须在一切的试炼中站立得住。
