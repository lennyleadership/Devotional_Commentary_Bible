34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.  
34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.  
34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.  
34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.  
34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.  

34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,  
34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.  
34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.  
34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.  
34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.  

34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.  
34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:  
34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:  
34:14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:  
34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;  

34:16 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.  
34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.  
34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.  
34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.  
34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.  

34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.  
34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.  
34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.  
34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.  
34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.  

34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.  
34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.  
34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.  
34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.  
34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.  

34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.  
34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.  
34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.  
34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.  
34:35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

34:1 耶和华吩咐摩西说、你要凿出两块石版、和先前你摔碎的那版一样。  其上的字我要写在这版上。  
34:2 明日早晨、你要预备好了、上西乃山、在山顶上站在我面前。  
34:3 谁也不可和你一同上去、遍山都不可有人、在山根也不可叫羊群牛群吃草。  
34:4 摩西就凿出两块石版、和先前的一样。  清晨起来、照耶和华所吩咐的上西乃山去、手里拿着两块石版。  
34:5 耶和华在云中降临、和摩西一同站在那里、宣告耶和华的名。  

34:6 耶和华在他面前宣告说、耶和华、耶和华、是有怜悯、有恩典的　神、不轻易发怒、并有丰盛的慈爱和诚实。  
34:7 为千万人存留慈爱、赦免罪孽、过犯、和罪恶。  万不以有罪的为无罪、必追讨他的罪、自父及子、直到三四代。  
34:8 摩西急忙伏地下拜、
34:9 说、主阿、我若在你眼前蒙恩、求你在我们中间同行、因为这是硬着颈项的百姓。  又求你赦免我们的罪孽、和罪恶、以我们为你的产业。  
34:10 耶和华说、我要立约、要在百姓面前行奇妙的事、是在遍地万国中所未曾行的。  在你四围的外邦人、就要看见耶和华的作为、因我向你所行的是可畏惧的事。  

34:11 我今天所吩咐你的、你要谨守。  我要从你面前撵出亚摩利人、迦南人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人。  
34:12 你要谨慎、不可与你所去那地的居民立约、恐怕成为你们中间的网罗。  
34:13 却要拆毁他们的祭坛、打碎他们的柱像、砍下他们的木偶。  
34:14 不可敬拜别神、因为耶和华是忌邪的　神、名为忌邪者。  
34:15 只怕你与那地的居民立约、百姓随从他们的神、就行邪淫、祭祀他们的神、有人叫你、你便吃他的祭物、

34:16 又为你的儿子娶他们的女儿为妻、他们的女儿随从他们的神就行邪淫、使你的儿子也随从他们的神行邪淫。  
34:17 不可为自己铸造神像。  
34:18 你要守除酵节、照我所吩咐你的、在亚笔月内所定的日期、吃无酵饼七天、因为你是这亚笔月内出了埃及。  
34:19 凡头生的都是我的、一切牲畜头生的、无论是牛是羊、公的都是我的。  
34:20 头生的驴、要用羊羔代赎、若不代赎、就要打折他的颈项。  凡头生的儿子都要赎出来。  谁也不可空手朝见我。  

34:21 你六日要作工、第七日要安息、虽在耕种收割的时候、也要安息。  
34:22 在收割初熟麦子的时候、要守七七节。  又在年底要守收藏节。  
34:23 你们一切男丁、要一年三次朝见主耶和华以色列的　神。  
34:24 我要从你面前赶出外邦人、扩张你的境界。  你一年三次上去朝见耶和华你　神的时候、必没有人贪慕你的地土。  
34:25 你不可将我祭物的血、和有酵的饼、一同献上。  逾越节的祭物、也不可留到早晨。  

34:26 地里首先初熟之物、要送到耶和华你　神的殿。  不可用山羊羔母的奶、煮山羊羔。  
34:27 耶和华吩咐摩西说、你要将这些话写上、因为我是按这话与你和以色列人立约。  
34:28 摩西在耶和华那里四十昼夜、也不吃饭、也不喝水。  耶和华将这约的话、就是十条诫、写在两块版上。  
34:29 摩西手里拿着两块法版下、西乃山的时候、不知道自己的面皮、因耶和华和他说话就发了光。  
34:30 亚伦和以色列众人看见摩西的面皮发光、就怕挨近他。  

34:31 摩西叫他们来、于是亚伦和会众的官长都到他那里去、摩西就与他们说话。  
34:32 随后以色列众人都近前来、他就把耶和华在西乃山与他所说的一切话、都吩咐他们。  
34:33 摩西与他们说完了话、就用帕子蒙上脸。  
34:34 但摩西进到耶和华面前与他说话、就揭去帕子、及至出来的时候、便将耶和华所吩咐的告诉以色列人。  
34:35 以色列人看见摩西的面皮发光、摩西又用帕子蒙上脸、等到他进去与耶和华说话就揭去帕子。
