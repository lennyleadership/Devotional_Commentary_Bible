3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.  
3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.  
3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.  
3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.  
3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.  

3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.  
3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;  
3:8 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  
3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.  
3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.  

3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?  
3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.  
3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?  
3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.  
3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.  

3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:  
3:17 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.  
3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.  
3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.  
3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.  

3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:  
3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

3:1 摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群、一日领羊群往野外去、到了　神的山、就是何烈山。  
3:2 耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。  摩西观看、不料、荆棘被火烧着、却没有烧毁。  
3:3 摩西说、我要过去看这大异象、这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢。  
3:4 耶和华　神见他过去要看、就从荆棘里呼叫说、摩西、摩西。  他说、我在这里。  
3:5 　神说、不要近前来、当把你脚上的鞋脱下来、因为你所站之地是圣地。  

3:6 又说、我是你父亲的　神、是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神。  摩西蒙上脸、因为怕看　神。  
3:7 耶和华说、我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦、我实在看见了。  他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声、我也听见了。  我原知道他们的痛苦。  
3:8 我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手、领他们出了那地、到美好宽阔流奶与蜜之地、就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。  
3:9 现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中、我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。  
3:10 故此我要打发你去见法老、使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。  

3:11 摩西对　神说、我是甚么人、竟能去见法老、将以色列人从埃及领出来呢。  
3:12 　神说、我必与你同在、你将百姓从埃及领出来之后、你们必在这山上事奉我、这就是我打发你去的证据。  
3:13 摩西对　神说、我到以色列人那里、对他们说、你们祖宗的　神打发我到你们这里来。  他们若问我说、他叫甚么名字、我要对他们说甚么呢。  
3:14 　神对摩西说、我是自有永有的。  又说、你要对以色列人这样说、那自有的打发我到你们这里来。  
3:15 　神又对摩西说、你要对以色列人这样说、耶和华你们祖宗的　神、就是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神、打发我到你们这里来。  耶和华是我的名、直到永远、这也是我的记念、直到万代。  

3:16 你去招聚以色列的长老、对他们说、耶和华你们祖宗的　神、就是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神、向我显现、说、我实在眷顾了你们、我也看见埃及人怎样待你们。  
3:17 我也说、要将你们从埃及的困苦中领出来、往迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的地去、就是到流奶与蜜之地。  
3:18 他们必听你的话。  你和以色列的长老要去见埃及王、对他说、耶和华希伯来人的　神、遇见了我们。  现在求你容我们往旷野去、走三天的路程、为要祭祀耶和华我们的　神。  
3:19 我知道虽用大能的手、埃及王也不容你们去。  
3:20 我必伸手、在埃及中间施行我一切的奇事、攻击那地。  然后他才容你们去。  

3:21 我必叫你们在埃及人眼前蒙恩、你们去的时候、就不至于空手而去。  
3:22 但各妇女必向他的邻舍、并居住在他家里的女人、要金器、银器、和衣裳、好给你们的儿女穿戴。  这样你们就把埃及人的财物夺去了。
