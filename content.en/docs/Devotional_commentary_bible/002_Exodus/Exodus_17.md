17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.  
17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  
17:3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?  
17:4 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.  
17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.  

17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. <a class ="marginnote">First time of smiting the rock.  The place is called Horeb.</a>   
17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  
17:8 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.  
17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.  
17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.  

17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.  
17:12 But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.  
17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.  
17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.  
17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:  

17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

17:1 以色列全会众都遵耶和华的吩咐、按着站口从汛的旷野往前行、在利非订安营。  百姓没有水喝、
17:2 所以与摩西争闹、说、给我们水喝吧。  摩西对他们说、你们为甚么与我争闹、为甚么试探耶和华呢。  
17:3 百姓在那里甚渴、要喝水、就向摩西发怨言、说、你为甚么将我们从埃及领出来、使我们和我们的儿女并牲畜、都渴死呢。  
17:4 摩西就呼求耶和华说、我向这百姓怎样行呢、他们几乎要拿石头打死我。  
17:5 耶和华对摩西说、你手里拿着你先前击打河水的杖、带领以色列的几个长老、从百姓面前走过去。  

17:6 我必在何烈的磐石那里站在你面前。  你要击打磐石、从磐石里必有水流出来、使百姓可以喝。  摩西就在以色列的长老眼前这样行了。  
17:7 他给那地方起名叫玛撒、〔就是试探的意思〕又叫米利巴、〔就是争闹的意思〕因以色列人争闹、又因他们试探耶和华说、耶和华是在我们中间不是。  
17:8 那时亚玛力人来在利非订、和以色列人争战。  
17:9 摩西对约书亚说、你为我们选出人来、出去和亚玛力人争战。  明天我手里要拿着　神的杖、站在山顶上。  
17:10 于是约书亚照着摩西对他所说的话行、和亚玛力人争战。  摩西、亚伦、与户珥、都上了山顶。  

17:11 摩西何时举手、以色列人就得胜、何时垂手、亚玛力人就得胜。  
17:12 但摩西的手发沉、他们就搬石头来、放在他以下、他就坐在上面。  亚伦与户珥扶着他的手、一个在这边、一个在那边、他的手就稳住、直到日落的时候。  
17:13 约书亚用刀杀了亚玛力王和他的百姓。  
17:14 耶和华对摩西说、我要将亚玛力的名号、从天下全然涂抹了、你要将这话写在书上作记念、又念给约书亚听。  
17:15 摩西筑了一座坛、起名叫耶和华尼西。  〔就是耶和华是我旌旗的意思〕

17:16 又说、耶和华已经起了誓、必世世代代和亚玛力人争战。
