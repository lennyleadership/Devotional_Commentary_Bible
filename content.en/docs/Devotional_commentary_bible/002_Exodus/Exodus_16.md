16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.  
16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:  
16:3 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.  
16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.  
16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.  

16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:  
16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?  
16:8 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.  
16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.  
16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.  

16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
16:12 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.  
16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.  
16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.  
16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.  

16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.  
16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.  
16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.  
16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.  
16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.  

16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.  
16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.  
16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.  
16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.  
16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.  

16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.  
16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.  
16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?  
16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.  
16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.  

16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.  
16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.  
16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.  
16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.  
16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.  

16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

16:1 以色列全会众从以琳起行、在出埃及后第二个月十五日、到了以琳和西乃中间、汛的旷野。  
16:2 以色列全会众在旷野向摩西、亚伦发怨言、
16:3 说、巴不得我们早死在埃及地耶和华的手下、那时我们坐在肉锅旁边、吃得饱足。  你们将我们领出来、到这旷野、是要叫这全会众都饿死阿。  
16:4 耶和华对摩西说、我要将粮食从天降给你们、百姓可以出去、每天收每天的分、我好试验他们遵不遵我的法度。  
16:5 到第六天他们要把所收进来的预备好了、比每天所收的多一倍。  

16:6 摩西亚伦对以色列众人说、到了晚上、你们要知道是耶和华将你们从埃及地领出来的。  
16:7 早晨、你们要看见耶和华的荣耀、因为耶和华听见你们向他所发的怨言了。  我们算甚么、你们竟向我们发怨言呢。  
16:8 摩西又说、耶和华晚上必给你们肉吃、早晨必给你们食物得饱、因为你们向耶和华发的怨言、他都听见了。  我们算甚么、你们的怨言不是向我们发的、乃是向耶和华发的。  
16:9 摩西对亚伦说、你告诉以色列全会众说、你们就近耶和华面前、因为他已经听见你们的怨言了。  
16:10 亚伦正对以色列全会众说话的时候、他们向旷野观看、不料、耶和华的荣光在云中显现。  

16:11 耶和华晓谕摩西说、
16:12 我已经听见以色列人的怨言。  你告诉他们说、到黄昏的时候、你们要吃肉、早晨必有食物得饱、你们就知道我是耶和华你们的　神。  
16:13 到了晚上、有鹌鹑飞来、遮满了营。  早晨在营四围的地上有露水、
16:14 露水上升之后、不料、野地面上有如白霜的小圆物。  
16:15 以色列人看见、不知道是甚么、就彼此对问说、这是甚么呢。  摩西对他们说、这就是耶和华给你们吃的食物。  

16:16 耶和华所吩咐的是这样。  你们要按着各人的饭量、为帐棚里的人按着人数收起来、各拿一俄梅珥。  
16:17 以色列人就这样行、有多收的、有少收的。  
16:18 及至用俄梅珥量一量、多收的也没有余、少收的也没有缺、各人按着自己的饭量收取。  
16:19 摩西对他们说、所收的、不许甚么人留到早晨。  
16:20 然而他们不听摩西的话、内中有留到早晨的、就生虫变臭了。  摩西便向他们发怒。  

16:21 他们每日早晨、按着各人的饭量收取、日头一发热、就消化了。  
16:22 到第六天、他们收了双倍的食物、每人两俄梅珥。  会众的官长来告诉摩西。  
16:23 摩西对他们说、耶和华这样说、明天是圣安息日、是向耶和华守的圣安息日、你们要烤的就烤了、要煮的就煮了、所剩下的都留到早晨。  
16:24 他们就照摩西的吩咐留到早晨、也不臭、里头也没有虫子。  
16:25 摩西说、你们今天吃这个吧、因为今天是向耶和华守的安息日。  你们在田野必找不着了。  

16:26 六天可以收取、第七天乃是安息日、那一天必没有了。  
16:27 第七天百姓中有人出去收、甚么也找不着。  
16:28 耶和华对摩西说、你们不肯守我的诫命和律法、要到几时呢。  
16:29 你们看、耶和华既将安息日赐给你们、所以第六天他赐给你们两天的食物、第七天各人要住在自己的地方、不许甚么人出去。  
16:30 于是百姓第七天安息了。  

16:31 这食物、以色列家叫吗哪。  样子像芫荽子、颜色是白的、滋味如同搀蜜的薄饼。  
16:32 摩西说、耶和华所吩咐的是这样。  要将一满俄梅珥吗哪留到世世代代、使后人可以看见我当日将你们领出埃及地、在旷野所给你们吃的食物。  
16:33 摩西对亚伦说、你拿一个罐子、盛一满俄梅珥吗哪、存在耶和华面前、要留到世世代代。  
16:34 耶和华怎么吩咐摩西、亚伦就怎么行、把吗哪放在法柜前存留。  
16:35 以色列人吃吗哪共四十年、直到进了有人居住之地、就是迦南的境界。  

16:36 〔俄梅珥乃伊法十分之一〕。
