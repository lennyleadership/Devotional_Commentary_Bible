24:1 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.  
24:2 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.  
24:3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.  
24:4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.  
24:5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.  

24:6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.  
24:7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.  
24:8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.  
24:9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:  
24:10 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.  

24:11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.  
24:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.  
24:13 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.  
24:14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.  
24:15 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.  

24:16 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.  
24:17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.  
24:18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

24:1 耶和华对摩西说、你和亚伦、拿答、亚比户、并以色列长老中的七十人、都要上到我这里来、远远的下拜。  
24:2 惟独你可以亲近耶和华。  他们却不可亲近。  百姓也不可和你一同上来。  
24:3 摩西下山、将耶和华的命令、典章、都述说与百姓听。  众百姓齐声说、耶和华所吩咐的、我们都必遵行。  
24:4 摩西将耶和华的命令都写上、清早起来、在山下筑一座坛、按以色列十二支派、立十二根柱子。  
24:5 又打发以色列人中的少年人去献燔祭、又向耶和华献牛为平安祭。  

24:6 摩西将血一半盛在盆中、一半洒在坛上。  
24:7 又将约书念给百姓听、他们说、耶和华所吩咐的、我们都必遵行。  
24:8 摩西将血洒在百姓身上、说、你看、这是立约的血、是耶和华按这一切话与你们立约的凭据。  
24:9 摩西、亚伦、拿答、亚比户、并以色列长老中的七十人、都上了山。  
24:10 他们看见以色列的　神、他脚下彷彿有平铺的蓝宝石、如同天色明净。  

24:11 他的手不加害在以色列的尊者身上。  他们观看　神、他们又吃又喝。  
24:12 耶和华对摩西说、你上山到我这里来住在这里、我要将石版、并我所写的律法、和诫命、赐给你、使你可以教训百姓。  
24:13 摩西和他的帮手约书亚起来、上了　神的山、
24:14 摩西对长老说、你们在这里等着、等到我们再回来、有亚伦、户珥与你们同在、凡有争讼的、都可以就近他们去。  
24:15 摩西上山、有云彩把山遮盖。  

24:16 耶和华的荣耀停于西乃山、云彩遮盖山六天。  第七天他从云中召摩西。  
24:17 耶和华的荣耀在山顶上、在以色列人眼前、形状如烈火。  
24:18 摩西进入云中上山、在山上四十昼夜。
