12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,  
12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.  
12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:  
12:4 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.  
12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:  

12:6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.  
12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.  
12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.  
12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.  
12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.  

12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.  
12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.  
12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.  
12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.  
12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.  

12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.  
12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.  
12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.  
12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.  
12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.  

12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.  
12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.  
12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.  
12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.  
12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.  

12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?  
12:27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.  
12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.  
12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.  
12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.  

12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.  
12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.  
12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.  
12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.  
12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:  

12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.  
12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.  
12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.  
12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.  
12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.  

12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.  
12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.  
12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:  
12:44 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.  
12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.  

12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.  
12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.  
12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.  
12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.  
12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.  

12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

12:1 耶和华在埃及地晓谕摩西亚伦说、
12:2 你们要以本月为正月、为一年之首。  
12:3 你们吩咐以色列全会众说、本月初十日、各人要按着父家取羊羔、一家一只。  
12:4 若是一家的人太少、吃不了一只羊羔、本人就要和他隔壁的邻舍共取一只、你们预备羊羔、要按着人数和饭量计算。  
12:5 要无残疾一岁的公羊羔、你们或从绵羊里取、或从山羊里取、都可以。  

12:6 要留到本月十四日、在黄昏的时候、以色列全会众把羊羔宰了。  
12:7 各家要取点血、涂在吃羊羔的房屋左右的门框上、和门楣上。  
12:8 当夜要吃羊羔的肉、用火烤了、与无酵饼和苦菜同吃。  
12:9 不可吃生的、断不可吃水煮的、要带着头、腿、五脏、用火烤了吃。  
12:10 不可剩下一点留到早晨、若留到早晨、要用火烧了。  

12:11 你们吃羊羔当腰间束带、脚上穿鞋、手中拿杖、赶紧地吃、这是耶和华的逾越节。  
12:12 因为那夜我要巡行埃及地、把埃及地一切头生的、无论是人是牲畜、都击杀了。  又要败坏埃及一切的神、我是耶和华。  
12:13 这血要在你们所住的房屋上作记号、我一见这血、就越过你们去、我击杀埃及地头生的时候、灾殃必不临到你们身上灭你们。  
12:14 你们要记念这日、守为耶和华的节、作为你们世世代代永远的定例。  
12:15 你们要吃无酵饼七日。  头一日要把酵从你们各家中除去、因为从头一日起、到第七日为止、凡吃有酵之饼的、必从以色列中剪除。  

12:16 头一日你们当有圣会、第七日也当有圣会、这两日之内、除了预备各人所要吃的以外、无论何工、都不可作。  
12:17 你们要守无酵节、因为我正当这日把你们的军队从埃及地领出来、所以你们要守这日、作为世世代代永远的定例。  
12:18 从正月十四日晚上、直到二十一日晚上、你们要吃无酵饼。  
12:19 在你们各家中、七日之内不可有酵、因为凡吃有酵之物的、无论是寄居的、是本地的、必从以色列的会中剪除。  
12:20 有酵的物、你们都不可吃、在你们一切住处要吃无酵饼。  

12:21 于是摩西召了以色列的众长老来、对他们说、你们要按着家口取出羊羔、把这逾越节的羊羔宰了。  
12:22 拿一把牛膝草、蘸盆里的血、打在门楣上、和左右的门框上。  你们谁也不可出自己的房门直到早晨。  
12:23 因为耶和华要巡行击杀埃及人、他看见血在门楣上、和左右的门框上、就必越过那门、不容灭命的进你们的房屋、击杀你们。  
12:24 这例你们要守着、作为你们和你们子孙永远的定例。  
12:25 日后你们到了耶和华按着所应许赐给你们的那地、就要守这礼。  

12:26 你们的儿女问你们说、行这礼是甚么意思。  
12:27 你们就说、这是献给耶和华逾越节的祭。  当以色列人在埃及的时候、他击杀埃及人、越过以色列人的房屋、救了我们各家。  于是百姓低头下拜。  
12:28 耶和华怎样吩咐摩西亚伦、以色列人就怎样行。  
12:29 到了半夜、耶和华把埃及地所有的长子、就是从坐宝座的法老、直到被掳囚在监里之人的长子、以及一切头生的牲畜、尽都杀了。  
12:30 法老和一切臣仆、并埃及众人、夜间都起来了。  在埃及有大哀号、无一家不死一个人的。  

12:31 夜间法老召了摩西亚伦来、说、起来。  连你们带以色列人、从我民中出去、依你们所说的、去事奉耶和华吧。  
12:32 也依你们所说的、连羊群牛群带着走吧、并要为我祝福。  
12:33 埃及人催促百姓、打发他们快快出离那地、因为埃及人说、我们都要死了。  
12:34 百姓就拿着没有酵的生面、把抟面盆包在衣服中、扛在肩头上。  
12:35 以色列人照着摩西的话行、向埃及人要金器银器、和衣裳。  

12:36 耶和华叫百姓在埃及人眼前蒙恩、以致埃及人给他们所要的、他们就把埃及人的财物夺去了。  
12:37 以色列人从兰塞起行、往疏割去。  除了妇人孩子、步行的男人约有六十万。  
12:38 又有许多闲杂人、并有羊群牛群和他们一同上去。  
12:39 他们用埃及带出来的生面、烤成无酵饼、这生面原没有发起、因为他们被催逼离开埃及、不能耽延、也没有为自己预备甚么食物。  
12:40 以色列人住在埃及共有四百三十年。  

12:41 正满了四百三十年的那一天、耶和华的军队都从埃及地出来了。  
12:42 这夜是耶和华的夜、因耶和华领他们出了埃及地、所以当向耶和华谨守、是以色列众人世世代代该谨守的。  
12:43 耶和华对摩西亚伦说、逾越节的例是这样、外邦人都不可吃这羊羔。  
12:44 但各人用银子买的奴仆、既受了割礼、就可以吃。  
12:45 寄居的、和雇工人、都不可吃。  

12:46 应当在一个房子里吃、不可把一点肉从房子里带到外头去。  羊羔的骨头、一根也不可折断。  
12:47 以色列全会众都要守这礼。  
12:48 若有外人寄居在你们中间、愿向耶和华守逾越节、他所有的男子务要受割礼、然后才容他前来遵守、他也就像本地人一样。  但未受割礼的、都不可吃这羊羔。  
12:49 本地人和寄居在你们中间的外人、同归一例。  
12:50 耶和华怎样吩咐摩西亚伦、以色列众人就怎样行了。  

12:51 正当那日、耶和华将以色列人按着他们的军队、从埃及地领出来。
