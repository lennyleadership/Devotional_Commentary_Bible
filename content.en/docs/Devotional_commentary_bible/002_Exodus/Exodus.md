Exodus Chapter 1  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
1:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.  
1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,  
1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,  
1:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.  
1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.  

1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.  
1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.  
1:8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.  
1:9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:  
1:10 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.  

1:11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.  
1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.  
1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:  
1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.  
1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:  

1:16 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.  
1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.  
1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?  
1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.  
1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.  

1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.  
1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

Exodus Chapter 2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.  
2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.  
2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.  
2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.  
2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.  

2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.  
2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?  
2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.  
2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.  
2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.  

2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.  
2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.  
2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  
2:14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.  
2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.  

2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.  
2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.  
2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?  
2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.  
2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.  

2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.  
2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.  
2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.  
2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.  
2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.

Exodus Chapter 3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.  
3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.  
3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.  
3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.  
3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.  

3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.  
3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;  
3:8 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  
3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.  
3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.  

3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?  
3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.  
3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?  
3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.  
3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.  

3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:  
3:17 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.  
3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.  
3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.  
3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.  

3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:  
3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

Exodus Chapter 4  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.  
4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.  
4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.  
4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:  
4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.  

4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.  
4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.  
4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.  
4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.  
4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.  

4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?  
4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.  
4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.  
4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.  
4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.  

4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.  
4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.  
4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.  
4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.  
4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.  

4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.  
4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:  
4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.  
4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.  
4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.  

4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.  
4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.  
4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.  
4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:  
4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.  

4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.  
5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.  
5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.  
5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.  
5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.  

5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,  
5:7 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.  
5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.  
5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.  
5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.  

5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.  
5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.  
5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.  
5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?  
5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?  

5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.  
5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.  
5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.  
5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.  
5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:  

5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.  
5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?  
5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

Exodus Chapter 6  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.  
6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:  
6:3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.  
6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.  
6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.  

6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:  
6:7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.  
6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.  
6:9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.  
6:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  

6:11 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.  
6:12 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?  
6:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.  
6:14 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.  
6:15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.  

6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.  
6:17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.  
6:18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.  
6:19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.  
6:20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.  

6:21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.  
6:22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.  
6:23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  
6:24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.  
6:25 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.  

6:26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.  
6:27 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.  
6:28 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,  
6:29 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.  
6:30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

Exodus Chapter 7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
7:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.  
7:2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.  
7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.  
7:4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.  
7:5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.  

7:6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.  
7:7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.  
7:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,  
7:9 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.  
7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.  

7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.  
7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.  
7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.  
7:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.  
7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.  

7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.  
7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.  
7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.  
7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.  
7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.  

7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.  
7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.  
7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.  
7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.  
7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.

Exodus Chapter 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  
8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:  
8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:  
8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.  
8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.  

8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.  
8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.  
8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.  
8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?  
8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.  

8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.  
8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.  
8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.  
8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.  
8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.  

8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.  
8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.  
8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.  
8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.  
8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  

8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.  
8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.  
8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.  
8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.  
8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.  

8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?  
8:27 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.  
8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.  
8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.  
8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.  

8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.  
8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.

Exodus Chapter 9  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35
9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  
9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,  
9:3 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.  
9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.  
9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.  

9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.  
9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.  
9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.  
9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.  
9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.  

9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.  
9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.  
9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  
9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.  
9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.  

9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.  
9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?  
9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.  
9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.  
9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:  

9:21 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.  
9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.  
9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.  
9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.  
9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.  

9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.  
9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.  
9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.  
9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.  
9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.  

9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.  
9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.  
9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.  
9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.  
9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:  
10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.  
10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.  
10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:  
10:5 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:  

10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.  
10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  
10:8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  
10:9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.  
10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.  

10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.  
10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.  
10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.  
10:14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.  
10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.  

10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.  
10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.  
10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.  
10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.  
10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.  

10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.  
10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:  
10:23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.  
10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.  
10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.  

10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.  
10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.  
10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.  
10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.

Exodus Chapter 11  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.  
11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.  
11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.  
11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:  
11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.  

11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.  
11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.  
11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.  
11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.  
11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.

Exodus Chapter 12  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51
12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,  
12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.  
12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:  
12:4 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.  
12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:  

12:6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.  
12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.  
12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.  
12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.  
12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.  

12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.  
12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.  
12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.  
12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.  
12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.  

12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.  
12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.  
12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.  
12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.  
12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.  

12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.  
12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.  
12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.  
12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.  
12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.  

12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?  
12:27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.  
12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.  
12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.  
12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.  

12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.  
12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.  
12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.  
12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.  
12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:  

12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.  
12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.  
12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.  
12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.  
12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.  

12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.  
12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.  
12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:  
12:44 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.  
12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.  

12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.  
12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.  
12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.  
12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.  
12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.  

12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
13:2 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.  
13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.  
13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.  
13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.  

13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.  
13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.  
13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.  
13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.  
13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.  

13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,  
13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.  
13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.  
13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:  
13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.  

13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.  
13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:  
13:18 But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.  
13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.  
13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.  

13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:  
13:22 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
14:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.  
14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.  
14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.  
14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?  

14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:  
14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.  
14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.  
14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.  
14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.  

14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  
14:12 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.  
14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.  
14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.  
14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:  

14:16 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.  
14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.  
14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.  
14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:  
14:20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.  

14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.  
14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.  
14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.  
14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,  
14:25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.  

14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.  
14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.  
14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.  
14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.  
14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.  

14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.

15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.  
15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.  
15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.  
15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.  
15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.  

15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.  
15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.  
15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.  
15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.  
15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.  

15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  
15:12 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.  
15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.  
15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.  
15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.  

15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.  
15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established.  
15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.  
15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.  
15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.  

15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.  
15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.  
15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.  
15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?  
15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,  

15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.  
15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

Exodus Chapter 16  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36
16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.  
16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:  
16:3 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.  
16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.  
16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.  

16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:  
16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?  
16:8 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.  
16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.  
16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.  

16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
16:12 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.  
16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.  
16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.  
16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.  

16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.  
16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.  
16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.  
16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.  
16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.  

16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.  
16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.  
16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.  
16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.  
16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.  

16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.  
16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.  
16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?  
16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.  
16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.  

16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.  
16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.  
16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.  
16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.  
16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.  

16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

Exodus Chapter 17  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.  
17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  
17:3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?  
17:4 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.  
17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.  

17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.  
17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  
17:8 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.  
17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.  
17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.  

17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.  
17:12 But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.  
17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.  
17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.  
17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:  

17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;  
18:2 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,  
18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:  
18:4 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:  
18:5 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:  

18:6 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.  
18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.  
18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.  
18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.  
18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.  

18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.  
18:12 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.  
18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.  
18:14 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?  
18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:  

18:16 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.  
18:17 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.  
18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.  
18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:  
18:20 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.  

18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:  
18:22 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.  
18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.  
18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.  
18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  

18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.  
18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.  
19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.  
19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;  
19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.  
19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:  

19:6 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.  
19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.  
19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.  
19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.  
19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,  

19:11 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.  
19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:  
19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.  
19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.  
19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.  

19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.  
19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.  
19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.  
19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.  
19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.  

19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.  
19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.  
19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.  
19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.  
19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

20:1 And God spake all these words, saying,  
20:2 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  
20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.  
20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:  
20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;  

20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.  
20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  
20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  
20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:  
20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:  

20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.  
20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.  
20:13 Thou shalt not kill.  
20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.  
20:15 Thou shalt not steal.  

20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.  
20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.  
20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.  
20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.  
20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.  

20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.  
20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.  
20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.  
20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.  
20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.  

20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.

Exodus Chapter 21  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36
21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.  
21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.  
21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.  
21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.  
21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:  

21:6 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.  
21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.  
21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.  
21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.  
21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.  

21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.  
21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.  
21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.  
21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.  
21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.  

21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.  
21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.  
21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:  
21:19 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.  
21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.  

21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.  
21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  
21:23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,  
21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,  
21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.  

21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.  
21:27 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.  
21:28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.  
21:29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.  
21:30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.  

21:31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.  
21:32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.  
21:33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;  
21:34 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.  
21:35 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.  

21:36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.

Exodus Chapter 22  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
22:1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.  
22:2 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.  
22:3 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.  
22:4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.  
22:5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.  

22:6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.  
22:7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.  
22:8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.  
22:9 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.  
22:10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:  

22:11 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.  
22:12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.  
22:13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.  
22:14 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.  
22:15 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.  

22:16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.  
22:17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.  
22:18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.  
22:19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.  
22:20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.  

22:21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.  
22:22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.  
22:23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;  
22:24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.  
22:25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.  

22:26 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:  
22:27 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.  
22:28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.  
22:29 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.  
22:30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.  

22:31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.

Exodus Chapter 23  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33
23:1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.  
23:2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:  
23:3 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.  
23:4 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.  
23:5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.  

23:6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.  
23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.  
23:8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.  
23:9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.  
23:10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:  

23:11 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.  
23:12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.  
23:13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.  
23:14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.  
23:15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

23:16 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.  
23:17 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the LORD God.  
23:18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.  
23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.  
23:20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.  

23:21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.  
23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.  
23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.  
23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.  
23:25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.  

23:26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.  
23:27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.  
23:28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.  
23:29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.  
23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.  

23:31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.  
23:32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.  
23:33 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

Exodus Chapter 24  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
24:1 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.  
24:2 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.  
24:3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.  
24:4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.  
24:5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.  

24:6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.  
24:7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.  
24:8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.  
24:9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:  
24:10 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.  

24:11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.  
24:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.  
24:13 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.  
24:14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.  
24:15 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.  

24:16 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.  
24:17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.  
24:18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
25:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.  
25:3 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,  
25:4 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,  
25:5 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,  

25:6 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,  
25:7 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.  
25:8 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.  
25:9 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.  
25:10 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.  

25:11 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.  
25:12 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.  
25:13 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.  
25:14 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.  
25:15 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.  

25:16 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.  
25:17 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.  
25:18 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.  
25:19 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.  
25:20 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.  

25:21 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.  
25:22 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.  
25:23 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.  
25:24 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.  
25:25 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.  

25:26 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.  
25:27 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.  
25:28 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.  
25:29 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them.  
25:30 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.  

25:31 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.  
25:32 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:  
25:33 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.  
25:34 And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers.  
25:35 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.  

25:36 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.  
25:37 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.  
25:38 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.  
25:39 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.  
25:40 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.

26:1 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.  
26:2 The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall have one measure.  
26:3 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.  
26:4 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.  
26:5 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one of another.  

26:6 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle.  
26:7 And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.

26:11 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.  
26:12 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.  
26:13 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it.

26:19 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

26:27 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward.  
26:28 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end.  
26:29 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.  
26:30 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.  

26:31 And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:  
26:32 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of silver.  
26:33 And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy.  
26:34 And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy place.  
26:35 And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side.  

26:36 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework.  
26:37 And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.

28:10 Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.  

28:11 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold.  
28:12 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial.  
28:13 And thou shalt make ouches of gold;  
28:14 And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches.  
28:15 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined linen, shalt thou make it.  

28:16 Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.

28:33 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:  
28:34 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.  
28:35 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when he cometh out, that he die not.

29:1 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,  
29:2 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them.  
29:3 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.  
29:4 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.  
29:5 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:  

29:6 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.  
29:7 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him.  
29:8 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.  
29:9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.  
29:10 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.  

29:11 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  
29:12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.  
29:13 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.  
29:14 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.  
29:15 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.  

29:16 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.  
29:17 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.  
29:18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.  
29:19 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.  
29:20 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.  

29:21 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.  
29:22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:  
29:23 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:  
29:24 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.  
29:25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.  

29:26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part.  
29:27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:  
29:28 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.  
29:29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.  
29:30 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.  

29:31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.  
29:32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  
29:33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.  
29:34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.  
29:35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.  

29:36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.  
29:37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.  
29:38 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.  
29:39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:  
29:40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.  

29:41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.  
29:42 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.  
29:43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.  
29:44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.  
29:45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.  

29:46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.

30:1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it.  
30:2 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.  
30:3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.  
30:4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.  
30:5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.  

30:6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.  
30:7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.  
30:8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.  
30:9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.  
30:10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.  

30:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
30:12 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.  
30:13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.  
30:14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.  
30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.  

30:16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.  
30:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
30:18 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.  
30:19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:  
30:20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:  

30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.  
30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
30:23 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,  
30:24 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:  
30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.  

30:26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,  
30:27 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,  
30:28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.  
30:29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.  
30:30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.  

30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.  
30:32 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.  
30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.  
30:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:  
30:35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:  

30:36 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.  
30:37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.  
30:38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.

31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
31:2 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:  
31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,  
31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,  
31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.  

31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;  
31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,  
31:8 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,  
31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,  
31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,  

31:11 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.  
31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
31:13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.  
31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.  
31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.  

31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.  
31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.  
31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.

32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  
32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.  
32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.  
32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.  
32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.  

32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.  
32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:  
32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.  
32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:  
32:10 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.  

32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?  
32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.  
32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.  
32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.  
32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.  

32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.  
32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.  
32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.  
32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.  
32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.  

32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  
32:22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.  
32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  
32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.  
32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

32:26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.  
32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.  
32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.  
32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.  
32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.  

32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.  
32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.  
32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.  
32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.  
32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.

Exodus Chapter 33  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:  
33:2 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:  
33:3 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.  
33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.  
33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.  

33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.  
33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.  
33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.  
33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.  
33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.  

33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.  
33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.  
33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.  
33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.  
33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.  

33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.  
33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.  
33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.  
33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.  
33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.  

33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:  
33:22 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:  
33:23 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.

Exodus Chapter 34  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35
34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.  
34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.  
34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.  
34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.  
34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.  

34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,  
34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.  
34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.  
34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.  
34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.  

34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.  
34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:  
34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:  
34:14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:  
34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;  

34:16 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.  
34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.  
34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.  
34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.  
34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.  

34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.  
34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.  
34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.  
34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.  
34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.  

34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.  
34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.  
34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.  
34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.  
34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.  

34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.  
34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.  
34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.  
34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.  
34:35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

35:1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.  
35:2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.  
35:3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.  
35:4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,  
35:5 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,  

35:6 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,  
35:7 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,  
35:8 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,  
35:9 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.  
35:10 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;  

35:11 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,  
35:12 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering,  
35:13 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,  
35:14 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,  
35:15 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,  

35:16 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,  
35:17 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,  
35:18 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,  
35:19 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.  
35:20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.  

35:21 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.  
35:22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.  
35:23 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.  
35:24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.  
35:25 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.  

35:26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair.  
35:27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;  
35:28 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.  
35:29 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.  
35:30 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;  

35:31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;  
35:32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,  
35:33 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.  
35:34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.  
35:35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.

Exodus Chapter 36  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38
36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.  
36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:  
36:3 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.  
36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;  
36:5 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.  

36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.  
36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.  
36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.  
36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.  
36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.  

36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.  
36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.  
36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.  
36:14 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.  
36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.  

36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.  
36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.  
36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.  
36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.  
36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.  

36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.  
36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.  
36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:  
36:24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.  
36:25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,  

36:26 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.  
36:27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.  
36:28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.  
36:29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.  
36:30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.  

36:31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,  
36:32 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.  
36:33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.  
36:34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.  
36:35 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.  

36:36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.  
36:37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;  
36:38 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.

37:1 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:  
37:2 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.  
37:3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.  
37:4 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.  
37:5 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.  

37:6 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.  
37:7 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;  
37:8 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.  
37:9 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.  
37:10 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:  

37:11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.  
37:12 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.  
37:13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.  
37:14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.  
37:15 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.  

37:16 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold.  
37:17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:  
37:18 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:  
37:19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.  
37:20 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:  

37:21 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.  
37:22 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.  
37:23 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold.  
37:24 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.  
37:25 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.  

37:26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.  
37:27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal.  
37:28 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.  
37:29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

38:1 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.  
38:2 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.  
38:3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.  
38:4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.  
38:5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves.  

38:6 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass.  
38:7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.  
38:8 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  
38:9 And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:  
38:10 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.  

38:11 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.  
38:12 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.  
38:13 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.  
38:14 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.  
38:15 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.  

38:16 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.  
38:17 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.  
38:18 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.  
38:19 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver.  
38:20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.  

38:21 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.  
38:22 And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.  
38:23 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.  
38:24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.  
38:25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:  

38:26 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.  
38:27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.  
38:28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them.  
38:29 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.  
38:30 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,  

38:31 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.

39:1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
39:2 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.  
39:3 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.  
39:4 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.  
39:5 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.  

39:6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.  
39:7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
39:8 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.  
39:9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.  
39:10 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.  

39:11 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.  
39:12 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.  
39:13 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.  
39:14 And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.  
39:15 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold.  

39:16 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.  
39:17 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.  
39:18 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.  
39:19 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.  
39:20 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.  

39:21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
39:22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.  
39:23 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.  
39:24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.  
39:25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;  

39:26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
39:27 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,  
39:28 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,  
39:29 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
39:30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.  

39:31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
39:32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.  
39:33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,  
39:34 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,  
39:35 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,  

39:36 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,  
39:37 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,  
39:38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,  
39:39 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,  
39:40 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,  

39:41 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.  
39:42 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.  
39:43 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.

Exodus Chapter 40  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38
40:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  
40:2 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.  
40:3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.  
40:4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.  
40:5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.  

40:6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.  
40:7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.  
40:8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.  
40:9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.  
40:10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.  

40:11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.  
40:12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.  
40:13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.  
40:14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:  
40:15 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.  

40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.  
40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.  
40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.  
40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:  

40:21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.  
40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.  
40:24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.  
40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.  

40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:  
40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.  
40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.  

40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:  
40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.  
40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.  
40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.  
40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.  

40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:  
40:37 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.  
40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

## 出埃及记 1章  

1:1 以色列的众子、各带家眷和雅各一同来到埃及、他们的名字记在下面。  
1:2 有流便、西缅、利未、犹大、
1:3 以萨迦、西布伦、便雅悯、
1:4 但、拿弗他利、迦得、亚设。  
1:5 凡从雅各而生的、共有七十人。  约瑟已经在埃及。  

1:6 约瑟和他的弟兄、并那一代的人都死了。  
1:7 以色列人生养众多并且繁茂、极其强盛、满了那地。  
1:8 有不认识约瑟的新王起来、治理埃及。  
1:9 对他的百姓说、看哪、这以色列民比我们还多、又比我们强盛。  
1:10 来吧我们不如用巧计待他们、恐怕他们多起来、日后若遇甚么争战的事、就连合我们的仇敌攻击我们、离开这地去了。  

1:11 于是埃及人派督工的辖制他们、加重担苦害他们。  他们为法老建造两座积货城、就是比东、和兰塞。  
1:12 只是越发苦害他们、他们越发多起来、越发蔓延。  埃及人就因以色列人愁烦。  
1:13 埃及人严严的使以色列人作工。  
1:14 使他们因作苦工觉得命苦、无论是和泥、是做砖、是作田间各样的工、在一切的工上都严严的待他们。  
1:15 有希伯来的两个收生婆、一名施弗拉、一名普阿。  埃及王对他们说、

1:16 你们为希伯来妇人收生、看他们临盆的时候、若是男孩、就把他杀了、若是女孩、就留他存活。  
1:17 但是收生婆敬畏　神、不照埃及王的吩咐行、竟存留男孩的性命。  
1:18 埃及王召了收生婆来、说、你们为甚么作这事、存留男孩的性命呢。  
1:19 收生婆对法老说、因为希伯来妇人与埃及妇人不同、希伯来妇人本是健壮的、〔原文作活泼的〕收生婆还没有到、他们已经生产了。  
1:20 　神厚待收生婆。  以色列人多起来、极其强盛。  

1:21 收生婆因为敬畏　神、　神便叫他们成立家室。  
1:22 法老吩咐他的众民说、以色列人所生的男孩、你们都要丢在河里、一切的女孩、你们要存留他的性命。

## 出埃及记 2章   

2:1 有一个利未家的人、娶了一个利未女子为妻。  
2:2 那女人怀孕、生一个儿子、见他俊美就藏了他三个月。  
2:3 后来不能再藏、就取了一个蒲草箱、抹上石漆和石油、将孩子放在里头、把箱子搁在河边的芦荻中。  
2:4 孩子的姐姐远远站着、要知道他究竟怎么样。  
2:5 法老的女儿来到河边洗澡、他的使女们在河边行走。  他看见箱子在芦荻中、就打发一个婢女拿来。  

2:6 他打开箱子看见那孩子、孩子哭了、他就可怜他、说、这是希伯来人的一个孩子。  
2:7 孩子的姐姐对法老的女儿说、我去在希伯来妇人中叫一个奶妈来、为你奶这孩子、可以不可以。  
2:8 法老的女儿说、可以。  童女就去叫了孩子的母亲来。  
2:9 法老的女儿对他说、你把这孩子抱去、为我奶他、我必给你工价。  妇人就抱了孩子去奶他。  
2:10 孩子渐长、妇人把他带到法老的女儿那里、就作了他的儿子。  他给孩子起名叫摩西、意思说、因我把他从水里拉出来。  

2:11 后来摩西长大、他出去到他弟兄那里、看他们的重担、见一个埃及人打希伯来人的一个弟兄。  
2:12 他左右观看、见没有人、就把埃及人打死了、藏在沙土里。  
2:13 第二天他出去见有两个希伯来人争斗、就对那欺负人的说、你为甚么打你同族的人呢。  
2:14 那人说、谁立你作我们的首领和审判官呢、难道你要杀我、像杀那埃及人么。摩西便惧怕、说、这事必是被人知道了。  
2:15 法老听见这事、就想杀摩西、但摩西躲避法老逃往米甸地居住。  

2:16 一日他在井旁坐下、米甸的祭司有七个女儿、他们来打水、打满了槽、要饮父亲的群羊。  
2:17 有牧羊的人来把他们赶走了、摩西却起来帮助他们、又饮了他们的群羊。  
2:18 他们来到父亲流珥那里、他说、今日你们为何来得这么快呢。  
2:19 他们说、有一个埃及人救我们脱离牧羊人的手、并且为我们打水饮了群羊。  
2:20 他对女儿们说、那个人在那里、你们为甚么撇下他呢、你们去请他来吃饭。  

2:21 摩西甘心和那人同住。  那人把他的女儿西坡拉给摩西为妻。  
2:22 西坡拉生了一个儿子、摩西给他起名叫革舜、意思说、因我在外邦作了寄居的。  
2:23 过了多年、埃及王死了。  以色列人因作苦工、就叹息哀求、他们的哀声达于　神。  
2:24 　神听见他们的哀声、就记念他与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所立的约。  
2:25 　神看顾以色列人、也知道他们的苦情。

## 出埃及记 3章  

3:1 摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群、一日领羊群往野外去、到了　神的山、就是何烈山。  
3:2 耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。  摩西观看、不料、荆棘被火烧着、却没有烧毁。  
3:3 摩西说、我要过去看这大异象、这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢。  
3:4 耶和华　神见他过去要看、就从荆棘里呼叫说、摩西、摩西。  他说、我在这里。  
3:5 　神说、不要近前来、当把你脚上的鞋脱下来、因为你所站之地是圣地。  

3:6 又说、我是你父亲的　神、是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神。  摩西蒙上脸、因为怕看　神。  
3:7 耶和华说、我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦、我实在看见了。  他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声、我也听见了。  我原知道他们的痛苦。  
3:8 我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手、领他们出了那地、到美好宽阔流奶与蜜之地、就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。  
3:9 现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中、我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。  
3:10 故此我要打发你去见法老、使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。  

3:11 摩西对　神说、我是甚么人、竟能去见法老、将以色列人从埃及领出来呢。  
3:12 　神说、我必与你同在、你将百姓从埃及领出来之后、你们必在这山上事奉我、这就是我打发你去的证据。  
3:13 摩西对　神说、我到以色列人那里、对他们说、你们祖宗的　神打发我到你们这里来。  他们若问我说、他叫甚么名字、我要对他们说甚么呢。  
3:14 　神对摩西说、我是自有永有的。  又说、你要对以色列人这样说、那自有的打发我到你们这里来。  
3:15 　神又对摩西说、你要对以色列人这样说、耶和华你们祖宗的　神、就是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神、打发我到你们这里来。  耶和华是我的名、直到永远、这也是我的记念、直到万代。  

3:16 你去招聚以色列的长老、对他们说、耶和华你们祖宗的　神、就是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神、向我显现、说、我实在眷顾了你们、我也看见埃及人怎样待你们。  
3:17 我也说、要将你们从埃及的困苦中领出来、往迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的地去、就是到流奶与蜜之地。  
3:18 他们必听你的话。  你和以色列的长老要去见埃及王、对他说、耶和华希伯来人的　神、遇见了我们。  现在求你容我们往旷野去、走三天的路程、为要祭祀耶和华我们的　神。  
3:19 我知道虽用大能的手、埃及王也不容你们去。  
3:20 我必伸手、在埃及中间施行我一切的奇事、攻击那地。  然后他才容你们去。  

3:21 我必叫你们在埃及人眼前蒙恩、你们去的时候、就不至于空手而去。  
3:22 但各妇女必向他的邻舍、并居住在他家里的女人、要金器、银器、和衣裳、好给你们的儿女穿戴。  这样你们就把埃及人的财物夺去了。

## 出埃及记 4章   

4:1 摩西回答说、他们必不信我、也不听我的话、必说、耶和华并没有向你显现。  
4:2 耶和华对摩西说、你手里是甚么。  他说、是杖。  
4:3 耶和华说、丢在地上、他一丢下去、就变作蛇、摩西便跑开。  
4:4 耶和华对摩西说、伸出手来、拿住他的尾巴、他必在你手中仍变为杖。  
4:5 如此好叫他们信耶和华他们祖宗的　神、就是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神、是向你显现了。  

4:6 耶和华又对他说、把手放在怀里、他就把手放在怀里、及至抽出来、不料、手长了大痲疯、有雪那样白。  
4:7 耶和华说、再把手放在怀里、他就再把手放在怀里、及至从怀里抽出来、不料、手已经复原、与周身的肉一样。  
4:8 又说、倘或他们不听你的话、也不信头一个神迹、他们必信第二个神迹。  
4:9 这两个神迹若都不信、也不听你的话、你就从河里取些水、倒在旱地上、你从河里取的水必在旱地上变作血。  
4:10 摩西对耶和华说、主阿、我素日不是能言的人、就是从你对仆人说话以后、也是这样、我本是拙口笨舌的。  

4:11 耶和华对他说、谁造人的口呢、谁使人口哑、耳聋、目明、眼瞎呢、岂不是我耶和华么。  
4:12 现在去吧、我必赐你口才、指教你所当说的话。  
4:13 摩西说、主阿、你愿意打发谁、就打发谁去吧。  
4:14 耶和华向摩西发怒说、不是有你的哥哥利未人亚伦么、我知道他是能言的、现在他出来迎接你、他一见你心里就欢喜。  
4:15 你要将当说的话传给他、我也要赐你和他口才、又要指教你们所当行的事。  

4:16 他要替你对百姓说话、你要以他当作口、他要以你当作　神。  
4:17 你手里要拿这杖、好行神迹。  
4:18 于是摩西回到他岳父叶忒罗那里、对他说、求你容我回去见我在埃及的弟兄、看他们还在不在。  叶忒罗对摩西说、你可以平平安安的去吧。  
4:19 耶和华在米甸对摩西说、你要回埃及去、因为寻索你命的人都死了。  
4:20 摩西就带着妻子和两个儿子、叫他们骑上驴回埃及地去。  摩西手里拿着　神的杖。  

4:21 耶和华对摩西说、你回到埃及的时候要留意、将我指示你的一切奇事、行在法老面前、但我要使〔或作任凭下同〕他的心刚硬、他必不容百姓去。  
4:22 你要对法老说、耶和华这样说、以色列是我的儿子、我的长子。  
4:23 我对你说过、容我的儿子去好事奉我、你还是不肯容他去、看哪、我要杀你的长子。  
4:24 摩西在路上住宿的地方、耶和华遇见他、想要杀他。  
4:25 西坡拉就拿一块火石割下他儿子的阳皮、丢在摩西脚前、说、你真是我的血郎了。  

4:26 这样耶和华才放了他。  西坡拉说、你因割礼就是血郎了。  
4:27 耶和华对亚伦说、你往旷野去迎接摩西、他就去、在　神的山遇见摩西和他亲嘴。  
4:28 摩西将耶和华打发他所说的言语、和嘱咐他所行的神迹、都告诉了亚伦。  
4:29 摩西亚伦就去招聚以色列的众长老。  
4:30 亚伦将耶和华对摩西所说的一切话、述说了一遍、又在百姓眼前行了那些神迹。  

4:31 百姓就信了。  以色列人听见耶和华眷顾他们、鉴察他们的困苦、就低头下拜。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 5章   

5:1 后来摩西亚伦去对法老说、耶和华以色列的　神这样说、容我的百姓去、在旷野向我守节。  
5:2 法老说、耶和华是谁、使我听他的话、容以色列人去呢、我不认识耶和华、也不容以色列人去。  
5:3 他们说、希伯来人的　神遇见了我们、求你容我们往旷野去、走三天的路程、祭祀耶和华我们的　神、免得他用瘟疫、刀兵、攻击我们。  
5:4 埃及王对他们说、摩西亚伦你们为甚么叫百姓旷工呢。  你们去担你们的担子吧。  
5:5 又说、看哪、这地的以色列人、如今众多、你们竟叫他们歇下担子。  

5:6 当天法老吩咐督工的和官长说、
5:7 你们不可照常把草给百姓作砖、叫他们自己去捡草。  
5:8 他们素常作砖的数目、你们仍旧向他们要、一点不可减少、因为他们是懒惰的、所以呼求说、容我们去祭祀我们的　神。  
5:9 你们要把更重的工夫加在这些人身上、叫他们劳碌、不听虚谎的言语。  
5:10 督工的和官长出来对百姓说、法老这样说、我不给你们草。  

5:11 你们自己在那里能找草、就往那里去找吧、但你们的工一点不可减少。  
5:12 于是百姓散在埃及遍地、捡碎稓当作草。  
5:13 督工的催着说、你们一天当完一天的工、与先前有草一样。  
5:14 法老督工的责打他所派以色列人的官长说、你们昨天今天为甚么没有照向来的数目作砖、完你们的工作呢。  
5:15 以色列人的官长就来哀求法老说、为甚么这样待你的仆人。  

5:16 督工的不把草给仆人、并且对我们说、作砖吧。  看哪、你仆人挨了打、其实是你百姓的错。  
5:17 但法老说、你们是懒惰的、你们是懒惰的、所以说、容我们去祭祀耶和华。  
5:18 现在你们去作工吧、草是不给你们的、砖却要如数交纳。  
5:19 以色列人的官长听说、你们每天作砖的工作一点不可减少、就知道是遭遇祸患了。  
5:20 他们离了法老出来、正遇见摩西亚伦站在对面、

5:21 就向他们说、愿耶和华鉴察你们、施行判断、因你们使我们在法老和他臣仆面前有了臭名、把刀递在他们手中杀我们。  
5:22 摩西回到耶和华那里说、主阿、你为甚么苦待这百姓呢、为甚么打发我去呢、
5:23 自从我去见法老奉你的名说话、他就苦待这百姓、你一点也没有拯救他们。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 6章   

6:1 耶和华对摩西说、现在你必看见我向法老所行的事、使他因我大能的手容以色列人去、且把他们赶出他的地。  
6:2 　神晓谕摩西说、我是耶和华。  
6:3 我从前向亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各、显现为全能的　神、至于我名耶和华、他们未曾知道。  
6:4 我与他们坚定所立的约、要把他们寄居的迦南地赐给他们。  
6:5 我也听见以色列人被埃及人苦待的哀声、我也记念我的约。  

6:6 所以你要对以色列人说、我是耶和华、我要用伸出来的膀臂重重地刑罚埃及人、救赎你们脱离他们的重担、不作他们的苦工。  
6:7 我要以你们为我的百姓。  我也要作你们的　神、你们要知道我是耶和华你们的　神、是救你们脱离埃及人之重担的。  
6:8 我起誓应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的那地、我要把你们领进去将那地赐给你们为业、我是耶和华。  
6:9 摩西将这话告诉以色列人、只是他们因苦工愁烦、不肯听他的话。  
6:10 耶和华晓谕摩西说、

6:11 你进去对埃及王法老说、要容以色列人出他的地。  
6:12 摩西在耶和华面前说、以色列人尚且不听我的话、法老怎肯听我这拙口笨舌的人呢。  
6:13 耶和华吩咐摩西亚伦往以色列人和埃及王法老那里去、把以色列人从埃及地领出来。  
6:14 以色列人家长的名字记在下面。  以色列长子流便的儿子是哈诺、法路、希斯仑、迦米。  这是流便的各家。  
6:15 西缅的儿子是耶母利、雅悯、阿辖、雅斤、琐辖、和迦南女子的儿子扫罗。  这是西缅的各家。  

6:16 利未众子的名字、按着他们的后代记在下面。  就是革顺、哥辖、米拉利。  利未一生的岁数是一百三十七岁。  
6:17 革顺的儿子按着家室、是立尼、示每。  
6:18 哥辖的儿子是暗兰、以斯哈、希伯伦、乌薛。  哥辖一生的岁数是一百三十三岁。  
6:19 米拉利的儿子是抹利、和母示。  这是利未的家、都按着他们的后代。  
6:20 暗兰娶了他父亲的妹妹约基别为妻、他给他生了亚伦和摩西。  暗兰一生的岁数是一百三十七岁。  

6:21 以斯哈的儿子是可拉、尼斐、细基利。  
6:22 乌薛的儿子是米沙利、以利撒反、西提利。  
6:23 亚伦娶了亚米拿达的女儿拿顺的妹妹以利沙巴为妻、他给他生了拿答、亚比户、以利亚撒、以他玛。  
6:24 可拉的儿子是亚惜、以利加拿、亚比亚撒。  这是可拉的各家。  
6:25 亚伦的儿子以利亚撒、娶了普铁的一个女儿为妻、他给他生了非尼哈。  这是利未人的家长、都按着他们的家。  

6:26 耶和华说、将以色列人按着他们的军队从埃及地领出来、这是对那亚伦摩西说的。  
6:27 对埃及王法老说、要将以色列人从埃及领出来的、就是这摩西亚伦。  
6:28 当耶和华在埃及地对摩西说话的日子、
6:29 他向摩西说、我是耶和华、我对你说的一切话、你都要告诉埃及王法老。  
6:30 摩西在耶和华面前说、看哪、我是拙口笨舌的人、法老怎肯听我呢。  


------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 7章   

7:1 耶和华对摩西说、我使你在法老面前代替　神、你的哥哥亚伦是替你说话的。  
7:2 凡我所吩咐你的、你都要说、你的哥哥亚伦要对法老说、容以色列人出他的地。  
7:3 我要使法老的心刚硬、也要在埃及地多行神迹奇事。  
7:4 但法老必不听你们、我要伸手重重地刑罚埃及、将我的军队以色列民从埃及地领出来。  
7:5 我伸手攻击埃及、将以色列人从他们中间领出来的时候、埃及人就要知道我是耶和华。  

7:6 摩西亚伦这样行、耶和华怎样吩咐他们、他们就照样行了。  
7:7 摩西亚伦与法老说话的时候、摩西八十岁、亚伦八十三岁。  
7:8 耶和华晓谕摩西亚伦说、
7:9 法老若对你们说、你们行件奇事吧、你就吩咐亚伦说、把杖丢在法老面前、使杖变作蛇。  
7:10 摩西亚伦进去见法老、就照耶和华所吩咐的行、亚伦把杖丢在法老和臣仆面前、杖就变作蛇。  

7:11 于是法老召了博士和术士来、他们是埃及行法术的、也用邪术照样而行。  
7:12 他们各人丢下自己的杖、杖就变作蛇、但亚伦的杖吞了他们的杖。  
7:13 法老心里刚硬、不肯听从摩西亚伦、正如耶和华所说的。  
7:14 耶和华对摩西说、法老心里固执、不肯容百姓去。  
7:15 明日早晨他出来往水边去、你要往河边迎接他、手里要拿着那变过蛇的杖、

7:16 对他说、耶和华希伯来人的　神打发我来见你、说、容我的百姓去、好在旷野事奉我、到如今你还是不听。  
7:17 耶和华这样说、我要用我手里的杖击打河中的水、水就变作血、因此、你必知道我是耶和华。  
7:18 河里的鱼必死、河也要腥臭、埃及人就要厌恶吃这河里的水。  
7:19 耶和华晓谕摩西说、你对亚伦说、把你的杖伸在埃及所有的水以上、就是在他们的江、河、池、塘以上、叫水都变作血、在埃及遍地、无论在木器中、石器中、都必有血。  
7:20 摩西亚伦就照耶和华所吩咐的行、亚伦在法老和臣仆眼前举杖击打河里的水、河里的水、都变作血了。  

7:21 河里的鱼死了、河也腥臭了、埃及人就不能吃这河里的水。  埃及遍地都有了血。  
7:22 埃及行法术的、也用邪术照样而行。  法老心里刚硬、不肯听摩西亚伦、正如耶和华所说的。  
7:23 法老转身进宫、也不把这事放在心上。  
7:24 埃及人都在河的两边挖地、要得水喝、因为他们不能喝这河里的水。  
7:25 耶和华击打河以后满了七天。  


------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 8章   

8:1 耶和华吩咐摩西说、你进去见法老、对他说、耶和华这样说、容我的百姓去、好事奉我。  
8:2 你若不肯容他们去、我必使青蛙糟蹋你的四境。  
8:3 河里要滋生青蛙、这青蛙要上来进你的宫殿、和你的卧房、上你的床榻、进你臣仆的房屋、上你百姓的身上、进你的炉灶、和你的抟面盆。  
8:4 又要上你和你百姓并你众臣仆的身上。  
8:5 耶和华晓谕摩西说、你对亚伦说、把你的杖伸在江、河、池以上、使青蛙到埃及地上来。  

8:6 亚伦便伸杖在埃及的诸水以上、青蛙就上来遮满了埃及地。  
8:7 行法术的也用他们的邪术照样而行、叫青蛙上了埃及地。  
8:8 法老召了摩西亚伦来说、请你们求耶和华使这青蛙离开我和我的民、我就容百姓去祭祀耶和华。  
8:9 摩西对法老说、任凭你吧、我要何时为你和你的臣仆、并你的百姓、祈求除灭青蛙离开你和你的宫殿、只留在河里呢。  
8:10 他说、明天、摩西说、可以照你的话吧、好叫你知道没有像耶和华我们　神的。  

8:11 青蛙要离开你和你的宫殿、并你的臣仆与你的百姓、只留在河里。  
8:12 于是摩西亚伦离开法老出去。  摩西为扰害法老的青蛙呼求耶和华。  
8:13 耶和华就照摩西的话行、凡在房里、院中、田间的青蛙都死了。  
8:14 众人把青蛙聚拢成堆、遍地就都腥臭。  
8:15 但法老见灾祸松缓、就硬着心不肯听他们、正如耶和华所说的。  

8:16 耶和华吩咐摩西说、你对亚伦说、伸出你的杖击打地上的尘土、使尘土在埃及遍地变作虱子。  〔或作虼蚤下同〕。  
8:17 他们就这样行。  亚伦伸杖击打地上的尘土、就在人身上和牲畜身上有了虱子、埃及遍地的尘土、都变成虱子了。  
8:18 行法术的也用邪术要生出虱子来、却是不能。  于是在人身上、和牲畜身上、都有了虱子。  
8:19 行法术的就对法老说、这是　神的手段。  法老心里刚硬、不肯听摩西亚伦、正如耶和华所说的。  
8:20 耶和华对摩西说、你清早起来、法老来到水边、你站在他面前、对他说、耶和华这样说、容我的百姓去、好事奉我。  

8:21 你若不容我的百姓去、我要叫成群的苍蝇到你和你臣仆、并你百姓的身上、进你的房屋。  并且埃及人的房屋、和他们所住的地、都要满了成群的苍蝇。  
8:22 当那日我必分别我百姓所住的歌珊地、使那里没有成群的苍蝇、好叫你知道我是天下的耶和华。  
8:23 我要将我的百姓和你的百姓分别出来。  明天必有这神迹。  
8:24 耶和华就这样行、苍蝇成了大群、进入法老的宫殿、和他臣仆的房屋。  埃及遍地、就因这成群的苍蝇败坏了。  
8:25 法老召了摩西亚伦来、说、你们去、在这地祭祀你们的　神吧。  

8:26 摩西说、这样行本不相宜、因为我们要把埃及人所厌恶的祭祀耶和华我们的　神。  若把埃及人所厌恶的在他们眼前献为祭、他们岂不拿石头打死我们么。  
8:27 我们要往旷野去、走三天的路程、照着耶和华我们　神所要吩咐我们的、祭祀他。  
8:28 法老说、我容你们去在旷野祭祀耶和华你们的　神、只是不要走得很远。  求你们为我祈祷。  
8:29 摩西说、我要出去求耶和华、使成群的苍蝇明天离开法老、和法老的臣仆、并法老的百姓、法老却不可再行诡诈、不容百姓去祭祀耶和华。  
8:30 于是摩西离开法老去求耶和华。  

8:31 耶和华就照摩西的话行、叫成群的苍蝇离开法老、和他的臣仆、并他的百姓、一个也没有留下。  
8:32 这一次法老又硬着心、不容百姓去。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 9章    

9:1 耶和华吩咐摩西说、你进去见法老、对他说、耶和华希伯来人的　神这样说、容我的百姓去、好事奉我。  
9:2 你若不肯容他们去、仍旧强留他们、
9:3 耶和华的手加在你田间的牲畜上、就是在马、驴、骆驼、牛群、羊群上、必有重重的瘟疫。  
9:4 耶和华要分别以色列的牲畜和埃及的牲畜、凡属以色列人的、一样都不死。  
9:5 耶和华就定了时候、说、明天耶和华必在此地行这事。  

9:6 第二天耶和华就行这事、埃及的牲畜几乎都死了、只是以色列人的牲畜一个都没有死。  
9:7 法老打发人去看、谁知、以色列人的牲畜连一个都没有死。  法老的心却是固执、不容百姓去。  
9:8 耶和华吩咐摩西亚伦说、你们取几捧炉灰、摩西要在法老面前向天扬起来。  
9:9 这灰要在埃及全地变作尘土、在人身上和牲畜身上、成了起泡的疮。  
9:10 摩西亚伦取了炉灰、站在法老面前。  摩西向天扬起来、就在人身上和牲畜身上、成了起泡的疮。  

9:11 行法术的在摩西面前站立不住、因为在他们身上、和一切埃及人身上、都有这疮。  
9:12 耶和华使法老的心刚硬、不听他们、正如耶和华对摩西所说的。  
9:13 耶和华对摩西说、你清早起来、站在法老面前、对他说、耶和华希伯来人的　神、这样说、容我的百姓去、好事奉我。  
9:14 因为这一次我要叫一切的灾殃临到你、和你臣仆、并你百姓的身上、叫你知道在普天下没有像我的。  
9:15 我若伸手用瘟疫攻击你和你的百姓、你早就从地上除灭了。  

9:16 其实我叫你存立、是特要向你显我的大能、并要使我的名传遍天下。  
9:17 你还向我的百姓自高、不容他们去么。  
9:18 到明天约在这时候、我必叫重大的冰雹降下、自从埃及开国以来、没有这样的冰雹。  
9:19 现在你要打发人把你的牲畜、和你田间一切所有的催进来、凡在田间不收回家的、无论是人是牲畜、冰雹必降在他们身上、他们就必死。  
9:20 法老的臣仆中惧怕耶和华这话的、便叫他的奴仆和牲畜、跑进家来。  

9:21 但那不把耶和华这话放在心上的、就将他的奴仆和牲畜、留在田里。  
9:22 耶和华对摩西说、你向天伸杖、使埃及遍地的人身上、和牲畜身上、并田间各样菜蔬上、都有冰雹。  
9:23 摩西向天伸杖、耶和华就打雷下雹、有火闪到地上、耶和华下雹在埃及地上。  
9:24 那时、雹与火搀杂、甚是利害、自从埃及成国以来、遍地没有这样的。  
9:25 在埃及遍地、雹击打了田间所有的人和牲畜、并一切的菜蔬、又打坏田间一切的树木。  

9:26 惟独以色列人所住的歌珊地、没有冰雹。  
9:27 法老打发人召摩西亚伦来、对他们说、这一次我犯了罪了、耶和华是公义的、我和我的百姓是邪恶的。  
9:28 这雷轰和冰雹已经够了、请你们求耶和华、我就容你们去、不再留住你们。  
9:29 摩西对他说、我一出城、就要向耶和华举手祷告、雷必止住、也不再有冰雹、叫你知道全地都是属耶和华的。  
9:30 至于你和你的臣仆、我知道你们还是不惧怕耶和华　神。  

9:31 那时、麻和大麦被雹击打、因为大麦已经吐穗、麻也开了花。  
9:32 只是小麦和粗麦没有被击打、因为还没有长成。  
9:33 摩西离了法老出城、向耶和华举手祷告、雷和雹就止住、雨也不再浇在地上了。  
9:34 法老见雨和雹与雷止住、就越发犯罪、他和他的臣仆都硬着心。  
9:35 法老的心刚硬、不容以色列人去、正如耶和华借着摩西所说的。  


------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 10章   

10:1 耶和华对摩西说、你进去见法老、我使他和他臣仆的心刚硬、为要在他们中间显我这些神迹。  
10:2 并要叫你将我向埃及人所作的事、和在他们中间所行的神迹、传于你儿子和你孙子的耳中、好叫你们知道我是耶和华。  
10:3 摩西亚伦就进去见法老、对他说、耶和华希伯来人的　神、这样说、你在我面前不肯自卑、要到几时呢、容我的百姓去、好事奉我。  
10:4 你若不肯容我的百姓去、明天我要使蝗虫进入你的境内、
10:5 遮满地面、甚至看不见地、并且吃那冰雹所剩的、和田间所长的一切树木。  

10:6 你的宫殿和你众臣仆的房屋、并一切埃及人的房屋、都要被蝗虫占满了、自从你祖宗和你祖宗的祖宗在世以来、直到今日、没有见过这样的灾。  摩西就转身离开法老出去。  
10:7 法老的臣仆对法老说、这人为我们的网罗、要到几时呢、容这些人去、事奉耶和华他们的　神吧。  埃及已经败坏了、你还不知道么。  
10:8 于是摩西亚伦被召回来见法老、法老对他们说、你们去事奉耶和华你们的　神、但那要去的是谁呢。  
10:9 摩西说、我们要和我们老的少的、儿子女儿同去、且把羊群牛群一同带去、因为我们务要向耶和华守节。  
10:10 法老对他们说、我容你们和你们妇人孩子去的时候、耶和华与你们同在吧。  你们要谨慎、因为有祸在你们眼前、〔或作你们存着恶意〕

10:11 不可都去、你们这壮年人去事奉耶和华吧、因为这是你们所求的。  于是把他们从法老面前撵出去。  
10:12 耶和华对摩西说、你向埃及地伸杖、使蝗虫到埃及地上来、吃地上一切的菜蔬、就是冰雹所剩的。  
10:13 摩西就向埃及地伸杖、那一昼一夜、耶和华使东风刮在埃及地上、到了早晨、东风把蝗虫刮了来。  
10:14 蝗虫上来、落在埃及的四境、甚是利害、以前没有这样的、以后也必没有。  
10:15 因为这蝗虫遮满地面、甚至地都黑暗了、又吃地上一切的菜蔬、和冰雹所剩树上的果子。  埃及遍地、无论是树木、是田间的菜蔬、连一点青的也没有留下。  

10:16 于是法老急忙召了摩西亚伦来、说、我得罪耶和华你们的　神、又得罪了你们。  
10:17 现在求你、只这一次、饶恕我的罪、求耶和华你们的　神、使我脱离这一次的死亡。  
10:18 摩西就离开法老去求耶和华。  
10:19 耶和华转了极大的西风、把蝗虫刮起、吹入红海、在埃及的四境连一个也没有留下。  
10:20 但耶和华使法老的心刚硬、不容以色列人去。  

10:21 耶和华对摩西说、你向天伸杖、使埃及地黑暗、这黑暗似乎摸得着。  
10:22 摩西向天伸杖、埃及遍地就乌黑了三天。  
10:23 三天之久、人不能相见、谁也不敢起来离开本处、惟有以色列人家中都有亮光。  
10:24 法老就召摩西来、说、你们去事奉耶和华、只是你们的羊群牛群要留下、你们的妇人孩子可以和你们同去。  
10:25 摩西说、你总要把祭物和燔祭牲交给我们、使我们可以祭祀耶和华我们的　神。  

10:26 我们的牲畜也要带去、连一蹄也不留下、因为我们要从其中取出来、事奉耶和华我们的　神。  我们未到那里、还不知道用甚么事奉耶和华。  
10:27 但耶和华使法老的心刚硬、不肯容他们去。  
10:28 法老对摩西说、你离开我去吧、你要小心、不要再见我的面、因为你见我面的那日、你就必死。  
10:29 摩西说、你说得好、我必不再见你的面了。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 11章  

11:1 耶和华对摩西说、我再使一样的灾殃临到法老和埃及、然后他必容你们离开这地。  他容你们去的时候、总要催逼你们都从这地出去。  
11:2 你要传于百姓的耳中、叫他们男女各人向邻舍要金器银器。  
11:3 耶和华叫百姓在埃及人眼前蒙恩、并且摩西在埃及地法老臣仆、和百姓的眼中、看为极大。  
11:4 摩西说、耶和华这样说、约到半夜我必出去巡行埃及遍地、
11:5 凡在埃及地、从坐宝座的法老、直到磨子后的婢女所有的长子、以及一切头生的牲畜、都必死。  

11:6 埃及遍地必有大哀号、从前没有这样的、后来也必没有。  
11:7 至于以色列中、无论是人是牲畜、连狗也不敢向他们摇舌、好叫你们知道耶和华是将埃及人和以色列人分别出来。  
11:8 你这一切臣仆都要俯伏来见我、说、求你和跟从你的百姓都出去、然后我要出去。  于是摩西气忿忿地离开法老出去了。  
11:9 耶和华对摩西说、法老必不听你们、使我的奇事在埃及地多起来。  
11:10 摩西亚伦在法老面前行了这一切奇事、耶和华使法老的心刚硬、不容以色列人出离他的地。  


------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 12章     

12:1 耶和华在埃及地晓谕摩西亚伦说、
12:2 你们要以本月为正月、为一年之首。  
12:3 你们吩咐以色列全会众说、本月初十日、各人要按着父家取羊羔、一家一只。  
12:4 若是一家的人太少、吃不了一只羊羔、本人就要和他隔壁的邻舍共取一只、你们预备羊羔、要按着人数和饭量计算。  
12:5 要无残疾一岁的公羊羔、你们或从绵羊里取、或从山羊里取、都可以。  

12:6 要留到本月十四日、在黄昏的时候、以色列全会众把羊羔宰了。  
12:7 各家要取点血、涂在吃羊羔的房屋左右的门框上、和门楣上。  
12:8 当夜要吃羊羔的肉、用火烤了、与无酵饼和苦菜同吃。  
12:9 不可吃生的、断不可吃水煮的、要带着头、腿、五脏、用火烤了吃。  
12:10 不可剩下一点留到早晨、若留到早晨、要用火烧了。  

12:11 你们吃羊羔当腰间束带、脚上穿鞋、手中拿杖、赶紧地吃、这是耶和华的逾越节。  
12:12 因为那夜我要巡行埃及地、把埃及地一切头生的、无论是人是牲畜、都击杀了。  又要败坏埃及一切的神、我是耶和华。  
12:13 这血要在你们所住的房屋上作记号、我一见这血、就越过你们去、我击杀埃及地头生的时候、灾殃必不临到你们身上灭你们。  
12:14 你们要记念这日、守为耶和华的节、作为你们世世代代永远的定例。  
12:15 你们要吃无酵饼七日。  头一日要把酵从你们各家中除去、因为从头一日起、到第七日为止、凡吃有酵之饼的、必从以色列中剪除。  

12:16 头一日你们当有圣会、第七日也当有圣会、这两日之内、除了预备各人所要吃的以外、无论何工、都不可作。  
12:17 你们要守无酵节、因为我正当这日把你们的军队从埃及地领出来、所以你们要守这日、作为世世代代永远的定例。  
12:18 从正月十四日晚上、直到二十一日晚上、你们要吃无酵饼。  
12:19 在你们各家中、七日之内不可有酵、因为凡吃有酵之物的、无论是寄居的、是本地的、必从以色列的会中剪除。  
12:20 有酵的物、你们都不可吃、在你们一切住处要吃无酵饼。  

12:21 于是摩西召了以色列的众长老来、对他们说、你们要按着家口取出羊羔、把这逾越节的羊羔宰了。  
12:22 拿一把牛膝草、蘸盆里的血、打在门楣上、和左右的门框上。  你们谁也不可出自己的房门直到早晨。  
12:23 因为耶和华要巡行击杀埃及人、他看见血在门楣上、和左右的门框上、就必越过那门、不容灭命的进你们的房屋、击杀你们。  
12:24 这例你们要守着、作为你们和你们子孙永远的定例。  
12:25 日后你们到了耶和华按着所应许赐给你们的那地、就要守这礼。  

12:26 你们的儿女问你们说、行这礼是甚么意思。  
12:27 你们就说、这是献给耶和华逾越节的祭。  当以色列人在埃及的时候、他击杀埃及人、越过以色列人的房屋、救了我们各家。  于是百姓低头下拜。  
12:28 耶和华怎样吩咐摩西亚伦、以色列人就怎样行。  
12:29 到了半夜、耶和华把埃及地所有的长子、就是从坐宝座的法老、直到被掳囚在监里之人的长子、以及一切头生的牲畜、尽都杀了。  
12:30 法老和一切臣仆、并埃及众人、夜间都起来了。  在埃及有大哀号、无一家不死一个人的。  

12:31 夜间法老召了摩西亚伦来、说、起来。  连你们带以色列人、从我民中出去、依你们所说的、去事奉耶和华吧。  
12:32 也依你们所说的、连羊群牛群带着走吧、并要为我祝福。  
12:33 埃及人催促百姓、打发他们快快出离那地、因为埃及人说、我们都要死了。  
12:34 百姓就拿着没有酵的生面、把抟面盆包在衣服中、扛在肩头上。  
12:35 以色列人照着摩西的话行、向埃及人要金器银器、和衣裳。  

12:36 耶和华叫百姓在埃及人眼前蒙恩、以致埃及人给他们所要的、他们就把埃及人的财物夺去了。  
12:37 以色列人从兰塞起行、往疏割去。  除了妇人孩子、步行的男人约有六十万。  
12:38 又有许多闲杂人、并有羊群牛群和他们一同上去。  
12:39 他们用埃及带出来的生面、烤成无酵饼、这生面原没有发起、因为他们被催逼离开埃及、不能耽延、也没有为自己预备甚么食物。  
12:40 以色列人住在埃及共有四百三十年。  

12:41 正满了四百三十年的那一天、耶和华的军队都从埃及地出来了。  
12:42 这夜是耶和华的夜、因耶和华领他们出了埃及地、所以当向耶和华谨守、是以色列众人世世代代该谨守的。  
12:43 耶和华对摩西亚伦说、逾越节的例是这样、外邦人都不可吃这羊羔。  
12:44 但各人用银子买的奴仆、既受了割礼、就可以吃。  
12:45 寄居的、和雇工人、都不可吃。  

12:46 应当在一个房子里吃、不可把一点肉从房子里带到外头去。  羊羔的骨头、一根也不可折断。  
12:47 以色列全会众都要守这礼。  
12:48 若有外人寄居在你们中间、愿向耶和华守逾越节、他所有的男子务要受割礼、然后才容他前来遵守、他也就像本地人一样。  但未受割礼的、都不可吃这羊羔。  
12:49 本地人和寄居在你们中间的外人、同归一例。  
12:50 耶和华怎样吩咐摩西亚伦、以色列众人就怎样行了。  

12:51 正当那日、耶和华将以色列人按着他们的军队、从埃及地领出来。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 13章  

13:1 耶和华晓谕摩西说、
13:2 以色列中凡头生的、无论是人是牲畜、都是我的、要分别为圣归我。  
13:3 摩西对百姓说、你们要记念从埃及为奴之家出来的这日、因为耶和华用大能的手将你们从这地方领出来。  有酵的饼都不可吃。  
13:4 亚笔月间的这日、是你们出来的日子。  
13:5 将来耶和华领你进迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、希未人、耶布斯人之地、就是他向你的祖宗起誓应许给你那流奶与蜜之地、那时你要在这月间守这礼。  

13:6 你要吃无酵饼七日、到第七日要向耶和华守节。  
13:7 这七日之久、要吃无酵饼、在你四境之内不可见有酵的饼、也不可见发酵的物。  
13:8 当那日、你要告诉你的儿子说、这是因耶和华在我出埃及的时候为我所行的事。  
13:9 这要在你手上作记号、在你额上作记念、使耶和华的律法常在你口中、因为耶和华曾用大能的手将你从埃及领出来。  
13:10 所以你每年要按着日期守这例。  

13:11 将来耶和华照他向你和你祖宗所起的誓、将你领进迦南人之地、把这地赐给你、
13:12 那时你要将一切头生的、并牲畜中头生的、归给耶和华。  公的都要属耶和华。  
13:13 凡头生的驴、你要用羊羔代赎、若不代赎、就要打折他的颈项。  凡你儿子中头生的都要赎出来。  
13:14 日后、你的儿子问你说、这是甚么意思、你就说、耶和华用大能的手将我们从埃及为奴之家领出来。  
13:15 那时法老几乎不容我们去、耶和华就把埃及地所有头生的、无论是人是牲畜、都杀了、因此我把一切头生的公牲畜献给耶和华为祭、但将头生的儿子都赎出来。  

13:16 这要在你手上作记号、在你额上作经文、因为耶和华用大能的手将我们从埃及领出来。  
13:17 法老容百姓去的时候、非利士地的道路虽近、　神却不领他们从那里走、因为　神说、恐怕百姓遇见打仗后悔、就回埃及去。  
13:18 所以　神领百姓绕道而行、走红海旷野的路。  以色列人出埃及地、都带着兵器上去。  
13:19 摩西把约瑟的骸骨一同带去、因为约瑟曾叫以色列人严严的起誓、对他们说、　神必眷顾你们、你们要把我的骸骨从这里一同带上去。  
13:20 他们从疏割起行、在旷野边的以倘安营。  

13:21 日间耶和华在云柱中领他们的路、夜间在火柱中光照他们、使他们日夜都可以行走。  
13:22 日间云柱、夜间火柱、总不离开百姓的面前。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 14章    

14:1 耶和华晓谕摩西说、
14:2 你吩咐以色列人转回、安营在比哈希录前、密夺和海的中间、对着巴力洗分靠近海边安营。  
14:3 法老必说、以色列人在地中绕迷了、旷野把他们困住了。  
14:4 我要使法老的心刚硬、他要追赶他们、我便在法老和他全军身上得荣耀、埃及人就知道我是耶和华。  于是以色列人这样行了。  
14:5 有人告诉埃及王说、百姓逃跑、法老和他的臣仆就向百姓变心、说、我们容以色列人去不再服事我们、这作的是甚么事呢。  

14:6 法老就预备他的车辆、带领军兵同去。  
14:7 并带着六百辆特选的车、和埃及所有的车、每辆都有车兵长。  
14:8 耶和华使埃及王法老的心刚硬、他就追赶以色列人、因为以色列人是昂然无惧的出埃及。  
14:9 埃及人追赶他们。  法老一切的马匹、车辆、马兵、与军兵、就在海边上靠近比哈希录对着巴力洗分、在他们安营的地方追上了。  
14:10 法老临近的时候、以色列人举目看见埃及人赶来、就甚惧怕、向耶和华哀求。  

14:11 他们对摩西说、难道在埃及没有坟地、你把我们带来死在旷野么、你为甚么这样待我们、将我们从埃及领出来呢。  
14:12 我们在埃及岂没有对你说过、不要搅扰我们、容我们服事埃及人么、因为服事埃及人比死在旷野还好。  
14:13 摩西对百姓说、不要惧怕、只管站住、看耶和华今天向你们所要施行的救恩、因为你们今天所看见的埃及人、必永远不再看见了。  
14:14 耶和华必为你们争战、你们只管静默、不要作声。  
14:15 耶和华对摩西说、你为甚么向我哀求呢、你吩咐以色列人往前走。  

14:16 你举手向海伸杖、把水分开。  以色列人要下海中走干地。  
14:17 我要使埃及人的心刚硬、他们就跟着下去、我要在法老和他的全军、车辆、马兵上得荣耀。  
14:18 我在法老、和他的车辆、马兵上、得荣耀的时候、埃及人就知道我是耶和华了。  
14:19 在以色列营前行走　神的使者、转到他们后边去、云柱也从他们前边转到他们后边立住。  
14:20 在埃及营和以色列营中间有云柱、一边黑暗、一边发光、终夜两下不得相近。  

14:21 摩西向海伸杖、耶和华便用大东风、使海水一夜退去、水便分开、海就成了干地。  
14:22 以色列人下海中走干地、水在他们的左右作了墙垣。  
14:23 埃及人追赶他们、法老一切的马匹、车辆、和马兵、都跟着下到海中。  
14:24 到了晨更的时候、耶和华从云火柱中向埃及的军兵观看、使埃及的军兵混乱了。  
14:25 又使他们的车轮脱落、难以行走、以致埃及人说、我们从以色列人面前逃跑吧、因耶和华为他们攻击我们了。  

14:26 耶和华对摩西说、你向海伸杖、叫水仍合在埃及人并他们的车辆、马兵身上。  
14:27 摩西就向海伸杖、到了天一亮、海水仍旧复原、埃及人避水逃跑的时候、耶和华把他们推翻在海中。  
14:28 水就回流、淹没了车辆、和马兵。  那些跟着以色列人下海法老的全军、连一个也没有剩下。  
14:29 以色列人却在海中走干地、水在他们的左右作了墙垣。  
14:30 当日耶和华这样拯救以色列人脱离埃及人的手、以色列人看见埃及人的死尸都在海边了。  

14:31 以色列人看见耶和华向埃及人所行的大事、就敬畏耶和华、又信服他和他的仆人摩西。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 15章   

15:1 那时摩西和以色列人、向耶和华唱歌说、我要向耶和华歌唱、因他大大战胜、将马和骑马的投在海中。  
15:2 耶和华是我的力量、我的诗歌、也成了我的拯救。  这是我的　神、我要赞美他、是我父亲的　神、我要尊崇他。  
15:3 耶和华是战士、他的名是耶和华。  
15:4 法老的车辆、军兵、耶和华已抛在海中、他特选的军长、都沉于红海。  
15:5 深水淹没他们、他们如同石头坠到深处。  

15:6 耶和华阿、你的右手施展能力、显出荣耀。  耶和华阿、你的右手摔碎仇敌。  
15:7 你大发威严、推翻那些起来攻击你的、你发出烈怒如火、烧灭他们像烧碎稓一样。  
15:8 你发鼻中的气、水便聚起成堆、大水直立如垒、海中的深水凝结。  
15:9 仇敌说、我要追赶、我要追上、我要分掳物、我要在他们身上称我的心愿、我要拔出刀来、亲手杀灭他们。  
15:10 你叫风一吹、海就把他们淹没、他们如铅沉在大水之中。  

15:11 耶和华阿、众神之中谁能像你、谁能像你至圣至荣、可颂可畏、施行奇事。  
15:12 你伸出右手、地便吞灭他们。  
15:13 你凭慈爱、领了你所赎的百姓。  你凭能力、引他们到了你的圣所。  
15:14 外邦人听见就发颤、疼痛抓住非利士的居民。  
15:15 那时以东的族长惊惶、摩押的英雄被战兢抓住、迦南的居民、心都消化了。  

15:16 惊骇恐惧临到他们。  耶和华阿、因你膀臂的大能、他们如石头寂然不动、等候你的百姓过去、等候你所赎的百姓过去。  
15:17 你要将他们领进去、栽于你产业的山上。  耶和华阿、就是你为自己所造的住处。  主阿、就是你手所建立的圣所。  
15:18 耶和华必作王、直到永永远远。  
15:19 法老的马匹、车辆、和马兵、下到海中、耶和华使海水回流淹没他们、惟有以色列人在海中走干地。  
15:20 亚伦的姐姐女先知米利暗、手里拿着鼓、众妇女也跟他出去拿鼓跳舞。  

15:21 米利暗应声说、你们要歌颂耶和华、因他大大战胜、将马和骑马的投在海中。  
15:22 摩西领以色列人从红海往前行、到了书珥的旷野、在旷野走了三天找不着水。  
15:23 到了玛拉不能喝那里的水、因为水苦、所以那地名叫玛拉。  
15:24 百姓就向摩西发怨言、说、我们喝甚么呢。  
15:25 摩西呼求耶和华、耶和华指示他一棵树、他把树丢在水里、水就变甜了。  耶和华在那里为他们定了律例、典章、在那里试验他们。  

15:26 又说、你若留意听耶和华你　神的话、又行我眼中看为正的事、留心听我的诫命、守我一切的律例、我就不将所加与埃及人的疾病加在你身上、因为我耶和华是医治你的。  
15:27 他们到了以琳、在那里有十二股水泉、七十棵棕树、他们就在那里的水边安营。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 16章     

16:1 以色列全会众从以琳起行、在出埃及后第二个月十五日、到了以琳和西乃中间、汛的旷野。  
16:2 以色列全会众在旷野向摩西、亚伦发怨言、
16:3 说、巴不得我们早死在埃及地耶和华的手下、那时我们坐在肉锅旁边、吃得饱足。  你们将我们领出来、到这旷野、是要叫这全会众都饿死阿。  
16:4 耶和华对摩西说、我要将粮食从天降给你们、百姓可以出去、每天收每天的分、我好试验他们遵不遵我的法度。  
16:5 到第六天他们要把所收进来的预备好了、比每天所收的多一倍。  

16:6 摩西亚伦对以色列众人说、到了晚上、你们要知道是耶和华将你们从埃及地领出来的。  
16:7 早晨、你们要看见耶和华的荣耀、因为耶和华听见你们向他所发的怨言了。  我们算甚么、你们竟向我们发怨言呢。  
16:8 摩西又说、耶和华晚上必给你们肉吃、早晨必给你们食物得饱、因为你们向耶和华发的怨言、他都听见了。  我们算甚么、你们的怨言不是向我们发的、乃是向耶和华发的。  
16:9 摩西对亚伦说、你告诉以色列全会众说、你们就近耶和华面前、因为他已经听见你们的怨言了。  
16:10 亚伦正对以色列全会众说话的时候、他们向旷野观看、不料、耶和华的荣光在云中显现。  

16:11 耶和华晓谕摩西说、
16:12 我已经听见以色列人的怨言。  你告诉他们说、到黄昏的时候、你们要吃肉、早晨必有食物得饱、你们就知道我是耶和华你们的　神。  
16:13 到了晚上、有鹌鹑飞来、遮满了营。  早晨在营四围的地上有露水、
16:14 露水上升之后、不料、野地面上有如白霜的小圆物。  
16:15 以色列人看见、不知道是甚么、就彼此对问说、这是甚么呢。  摩西对他们说、这就是耶和华给你们吃的食物。  

16:16 耶和华所吩咐的是这样。  你们要按着各人的饭量、为帐棚里的人按着人数收起来、各拿一俄梅珥。  
16:17 以色列人就这样行、有多收的、有少收的。  
16:18 及至用俄梅珥量一量、多收的也没有余、少收的也没有缺、各人按着自己的饭量收取。  
16:19 摩西对他们说、所收的、不许甚么人留到早晨。  
16:20 然而他们不听摩西的话、内中有留到早晨的、就生虫变臭了。  摩西便向他们发怒。  

16:21 他们每日早晨、按着各人的饭量收取、日头一发热、就消化了。  
16:22 到第六天、他们收了双倍的食物、每人两俄梅珥。  会众的官长来告诉摩西。  
16:23 摩西对他们说、耶和华这样说、明天是圣安息日、是向耶和华守的圣安息日、你们要烤的就烤了、要煮的就煮了、所剩下的都留到早晨。  
16:24 他们就照摩西的吩咐留到早晨、也不臭、里头也没有虫子。  
16:25 摩西说、你们今天吃这个吧、因为今天是向耶和华守的安息日。  你们在田野必找不着了。  

16:26 六天可以收取、第七天乃是安息日、那一天必没有了。  
16:27 第七天百姓中有人出去收、甚么也找不着。  
16:28 耶和华对摩西说、你们不肯守我的诫命和律法、要到几时呢。  
16:29 你们看、耶和华既将安息日赐给你们、所以第六天他赐给你们两天的食物、第七天各人要住在自己的地方、不许甚么人出去。  
16:30 于是百姓第七天安息了。  

16:31 这食物、以色列家叫吗哪。  样子像芫荽子、颜色是白的、滋味如同搀蜜的薄饼。  
16:32 摩西说、耶和华所吩咐的是这样。  要将一满俄梅珥吗哪留到世世代代、使后人可以看见我当日将你们领出埃及地、在旷野所给你们吃的食物。  
16:33 摩西对亚伦说、你拿一个罐子、盛一满俄梅珥吗哪、存在耶和华面前、要留到世世代代。  
16:34 耶和华怎么吩咐摩西、亚伦就怎么行、把吗哪放在法柜前存留。  
16:35 以色列人吃吗哪共四十年、直到进了有人居住之地、就是迦南的境界。  

16:36 〔俄梅珥乃伊法十分之一〕。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 17章  

17:1 以色列全会众都遵耶和华的吩咐、按着站口从汛的旷野往前行、在利非订安营。  百姓没有水喝、
17:2 所以与摩西争闹、说、给我们水喝吧。  摩西对他们说、你们为甚么与我争闹、为甚么试探耶和华呢。  
17:3 百姓在那里甚渴、要喝水、就向摩西发怨言、说、你为甚么将我们从埃及领出来、使我们和我们的儿女并牲畜、都渴死呢。  
17:4 摩西就呼求耶和华说、我向这百姓怎样行呢、他们几乎要拿石头打死我。  
17:5 耶和华对摩西说、你手里拿着你先前击打河水的杖、带领以色列的几个长老、从百姓面前走过去。  

17:6 我必在何烈的磐石那里站在你面前。  你要击打磐石、从磐石里必有水流出来、使百姓可以喝。  摩西就在以色列的长老眼前这样行了。  
17:7 他给那地方起名叫玛撒、〔就是试探的意思〕又叫米利巴、〔就是争闹的意思〕因以色列人争闹、又因他们试探耶和华说、耶和华是在我们中间不是。  
17:8 那时亚玛力人来在利非订、和以色列人争战。  
17:9 摩西对约书亚说、你为我们选出人来、出去和亚玛力人争战。  明天我手里要拿着　神的杖、站在山顶上。  
17:10 于是约书亚照着摩西对他所说的话行、和亚玛力人争战。  摩西、亚伦、与户珥、都上了山顶。  

17:11 摩西何时举手、以色列人就得胜、何时垂手、亚玛力人就得胜。  
17:12 但摩西的手发沉、他们就搬石头来、放在他以下、他就坐在上面。  亚伦与户珥扶着他的手、一个在这边、一个在那边、他的手就稳住、直到日落的时候。  
17:13 约书亚用刀杀了亚玛力王和他的百姓。  
17:14 耶和华对摩西说、我要将亚玛力的名号、从天下全然涂抹了、你要将这话写在书上作记念、又念给约书亚听。  
17:15 摩西筑了一座坛、起名叫耶和华尼西。  〔就是耶和华是我旌旗的意思〕

17:16 又说、耶和华已经起了誓、必世世代代和亚玛力人争战。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 18章   

18:1 摩西的岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗、听见　神为摩西和　神的百姓以色列所行的一切事、就是耶和华将以色列从埃及领出来的事。  
18:2 便带着摩西的妻子西坡拉、就是摩西从前打发回去的。  
18:3 又带着西坡拉的两个儿子、一个名叫革舜、因为摩西说、我在外邦作了寄居的。  
18:4 一个名叫以利以谢、因为他说、我父亲的　神帮助了我、救我脱离法老的刀。  
18:5 摩西的岳父叶忒罗带着摩西的妻子和两个儿子、来到　神的山、就是摩西在旷野安营的地方。  

18:6 他对摩西说、我是你岳父叶忒罗、带着你的妻子和两个儿子、来到你这里。  
18:7 摩西迎接他的岳父、向他下拜、与他亲嘴、彼此问安、都进了帐棚。  
18:8 摩西将耶和华为以色列的缘故向法老和埃及人所行的一切事、以及路上所遭遇的一切艰难、并耶和华怎样搭救他们、都述说与他岳父听。  
18:9 叶忒罗因耶和华待以色列的一切好处、就是拯救他们脱离埃及人的手、便甚欢喜。  
18:10 叶忒罗说、耶和华是应当称颂的、他救了你们脱离埃及人和法老的手、将这百姓从埃及人的手下救出来。  

18:11 我现今在埃及人向这百姓发狂傲的事上、得知耶和华比万神都大。  
18:12 摩西的岳父叶忒罗、把燔祭和平安祭献给　神。  亚伦和以色列的众长老都来了、与摩西的岳父在　神面前吃饭。  
18:13 第二天摩西坐着审判百姓、百姓从早到晚都站在摩西的左右。  
18:14 摩西的岳父看见他向百姓所作的一切事、就说、你向百姓作的是甚么事呢、你为甚么独自坐着、众百姓从早到晚都站在你的左右呢。  
18:15 摩西对岳父说、这是因百姓到我这里来求问　神。  

18:16 他们有事的时候、就到我这里来、我便在两造之间施行审判。  我又叫他们知道　神的律例、和法度。  
18:17 摩西的岳父说、你这作的不好。  
18:18 你和这些百姓必都疲惫、因为这事太重、你独自一人办理不了。  
18:19 现在你要听我的话、我为你出个主意、愿　神与你同在。  你要替百姓到　神面前、将案件奏告　神。  
18:20 又要将律例和法度教训他们、指示他们当行的道、当作的事。  

18:21 并要从百姓中拣选有才能的人、就是敬畏　神、诚实无妄、恨不义之财的人、派他们作千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长、管理百姓。  
18:22 叫他们随时审判百姓、大事都要呈到你这里、小事他们自己可以审判。  这样、你就轻省些、他们也可以同当此任。  
18:23 你若这样行、　神也这样吩咐你、你就能受得住、这百姓也都平平安安归回他们的住处。  
18:24 于是摩西听从他岳父的话、按着他所说的去行。  
18:25 摩西从以色列人中拣选了有才能的人、立他们为百姓的首领、作千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长。  

18:26 他们随时审判百姓、有难断的案件、就呈到摩西那里、但各样小事他们自己审判。  
18:27 此后、摩西让他的岳父去、他就往本地去了。

## 出埃及记 19章   

19:1 以色列人出埃及地以后、满了三个月的那一天、就来到西乃的旷野。  
19:2 他们离了利非订来到西乃的旷野、就在那里的山下安营。  
19:3 摩西到　神那里、耶和华从山上呼唤他说、你要这样告诉雅各家、晓谕以色列人、说、
19:4 我向埃及人所行的事、你们都看见了、且看见我如鹰将你们背在翅膀上、带来归我。  
19:5 如今你们若实在听从我的话、遵守我的约、就要在万民中作属我的子民、因为全地都是我的。  

19:6 你们要归我作祭司的国度、为圣洁的国民。  这些话你要告诉以色列人。  
19:7 摩西去召了民间的长老来、将耶和华所吩咐他的话、都在他们面前陈明。  
19:8 百姓都同声回答说、凡耶和华所说的、我们都要遵行。  摩西就将百姓的话回复耶和华。  
19:9 耶和华对摩西说、我要在密云中临到你那里、叫百姓在我与你说话的时候可以听见、也可以永远信你了。  于是摩西将百姓的话奏告耶和华。  
19:10 耶和华又对摩西说、你往百姓那里去、叫他们今天明天自洁、又叫他们洗衣服。  

19:11 到第三天要预备好了、因为第三天耶和华要在众百姓眼前降临在西乃山上。  
19:12 你要在山的四围给百姓定界限、说、你们当谨慎、不可上山去、也不可摸山的边界、凡摸这山的、必要治死他。  
19:13 不可用手摸他、必用石头打死、或用箭射透、无论是人、是牲畜、都不得活。  到角声拖长的时候、他们才可到山根来。  
19:14 摩西下山往百姓那里去、叫他们自洁、他们就洗衣服。  
19:15 他对百姓说、到第三天要预备好了、不可亲近女人。  

19:16 到了第三天早晨、在山上有雷轰、闪电、和密云。  并且角声甚大。  营中的百姓尽都发颤。  
19:17 摩西率领百姓出营迎接　神、都站在山下。  
19:18 西乃全山冒烟、因为耶和华在火中降于山上、山的烟气上腾、如烧窑一般。  遍山大大的震动。  
19:19 角声渐渐的高而又高、摩西就说话、　神有声音答应他。  
19:20 耶和华降临在西乃山顶上、耶和华召摩西上山顶、摩西就上去。  

19:21 耶和华对摩西说、你下去嘱咐百姓、不可闯过来到我面前观看、恐怕他们有多人死亡。  
19:22 又叫亲近我的祭司自洁、恐怕我忽然出来击杀他们。  
19:23 摩西对耶和华说、百姓不能上西乃山、因为你已经嘱咐我们说、要在山的四围定界限、叫山成圣。  
19:24 耶和华对他说、下去吧、你要和亚伦一同上来、只是祭司和百姓不可闯过来上到我面前、恐怕我忽然出来击杀他们。  
19:25 于是摩西下到百姓那里告诉他们。

## 出埃及记 20章   

20:1 　神吩咐这一切的话、说、
20:2 我是耶和华你的　神、曾将你从埃及地为奴之家领出来。  
20:3 除了我以外、你不可有别的神。  
20:4 不可为自己雕刻偶像、也不可作甚么形像、彷彿上天、下地、和地底下、水中的百物。  
20:5 不可跪拜那些像、也不可事奉他、因为我耶和华你的　神是忌邪的　神、恨我的、我必追讨他的罪、自父及子、直到三四代。  

20:6 爱我守我诫命的、我必向他们发慈爱、直到千代。  
20:7 不可妄称耶和华你　神的名、因为妄称耶和华名的、耶和华必不以他为无罪。  
20:8 当记念安息日、守为圣日。  
20:9 六日要劳碌作你一切的工。  
20:10 但第七日是向耶和华你　神当守的安息日。  这一日你和你的儿女、仆婢、牲畜、并你城里寄居的客旅、无论何工都不可作。  

20:11 因为六日之内、耶和华造天、地、海、和其中的万物、第七日便安息。  所以耶和华赐福与安息日、定为圣日。  
20:12 当孝敬父母、使你的日子在耶和华你　神所赐你的地上、得以长久。  
20:13 不可杀人。  
20:14 不可奸淫。  
20:15 不可偷盗。  

20:16 不可作假见证陷害人。  
20:17 不可贪恋人的房屋、也不可贪恋人的妻子、仆婢、牛驴、并他一切所有的。  
20:18 众百姓见雷轰、闪电、角声、山上冒烟、就都发颤、远远的站立。  
20:19 对摩西说、求你和我们说话、我们必听、不要　神和我们说话、恐怕我们死亡。  
20:20 摩西对百姓说、不要惧怕、因为　神降临是要试验你们、叫你们时常敬畏他、不至犯罪。  

20:21 于是百姓远远的站立。  摩西就挨近　神所在的幽暗之中。  
20:22 耶和华对摩西说、你要向以色列人这样说、你们自己看见我从天上和你们说话了。  
20:23 你们不可作甚么神像与我相配、不可为自己作金银的神像。  
20:24 你要为我筑土坛、在上面以牛羊献为燔祭、和平安祭。  凡记下我名的地方、我必到那里赐福给你。  
20:25 你若为我筑一座石坛、不可用凿成的石头、因你在上头一动家具、就把坛污秽了。  

20:26 你上我的坛、不可用台阶、免得露出你的下体来。

## 出埃及记 21章     

21:1 你在百姓面前所要立的典章是这样。  
21:2 你若买希伯来人作奴仆、他必服事你六年、第七年他可以自由、白白地出去。  
21:3 他若孤身来、就可以孤身去。  他若有妻、他的妻就可以同他出去。  
21:4 他主人若给他妻子、妻子给他生了儿子、或女儿、妻子和儿女要归主人、他要独自出去。  
21:5 倘或奴仆明说、我爱我的主人、和我的妻子儿女、不愿意自由出去。  

21:6 他的主人就要带他到审判官那里、〔审判官或作　神下同〕又要带他到门前、靠近门框、用锥子穿他的耳朵、他就永远服事主人。  
21:7 人若卖女儿作婢女、婢女不可像男仆那样出去。  
21:8 主人选定他归自己、若不喜欢他、就要许他赎身。  主人既然用诡诈待他、就没有权柄卖给外邦人。  
21:9 主人若选定他给自己的儿子、就当待他如同女儿。  
21:10 若另娶一个、那女子的吃食、衣服、并好合的事、仍不可减少。  

21:11 若不向他行这三样、他就可以不用钱赎、白白的出去。  
21:12 打人以致打死的、必要把他治死。  
21:13 人若不是埋伏着杀人、乃是　神交在他手中、我就设下一个地方、他可以往那里逃跑。  
21:14 人若任意用诡计杀了他的邻舍、就是逃到我的坛那里、也当捉去把他治死。  
21:15 打父母的、必要把他治死。  

21:16 拐带人口、或是把人卖了、或是留在他手下、必要把他治死。  
21:17 咒骂父母的、必要把他治死。  
21:18 人若彼此相争、这个用石头或是拳头打那个、尚且不至于死、不过躺卧在床、
21:19 若再能起来扶杖而出、那打他的可算无罪、但要将他耽误的工夫用钱赔补、并要将他全然医好。  
21:20 人若用棍子打奴仆或婢女、立时死在他的手下、他必要受刑。  

21:21 若过一两天才死、就可以不受刑、因为是用钱买的。  
21:22 人若彼此争斗、伤害有孕的妇人、甚至坠胎、随后却无别害、那伤害他的总要按妇人的丈夫所要的、照审判官所断的受罚。  
21:23 若有别害、就要以命偿命、
21:24 以眼还眼、以牙还牙、以手还手、以脚还脚、
21:25 以烙还烙、以伤还伤、以打还打。  

21:26 人若打坏了他奴仆或是婢女的一只眼、就要因他的眼放他去得以自由。  
21:27 若打掉了他奴仆或是婢女的一个牙、就要因他的牙放他去得以自由。  
21:28 牛若触死男人、或是女人、总要用石头打死那牛、却不可吃他的肉。  牛的主人可算无罪。  
21:29 倘若那牛素来是触人的、有人报告了牛主、他竟不把牛拴着、以致把男人或是女人触死、就要用石头打死那牛、牛主也必治死。  
21:30 若罚他赎命的价银、他必照所罚的、赎他的命。  

21:31 牛无论触了人的儿子、或是女儿、必照这例办理。  
21:32 牛若触了奴仆、或是婢女、必将银子三十舍客勒给他们的主人、也要用石头把牛打死。  
21:33 人若敞着井口、或挖井不遮盖、有牛、或驴掉在里头。  
21:34 井主要拿钱赔还本主人。  死牲畜要归自己。  
21:35 这人的牛若伤了那人的牛、以致于死、他们要卖了活牛、平分价值、也要平分死牛。  

21:36 人若知道这牛素来是触人的、主人竟不把牛拴着、他必要以牛还牛、死牛要归自己。  

------------------------------------------

## 出埃及记 22章    

22:1 人若偷牛、或羊、无论是宰了、是卖了、他就要以五牛赔一牛、四羊赔一羊。  
22:2 人若遇见贼挖窟窿、把贼打了、以致于死、就不能为他有流血的罪。  
22:3 若太阳已经出来、就为他有流血的罪。  贼若被拿、总要赔还、若他一无所有、就要被卖、顶他所偷的物。  
22:4 若他所偷的、或牛、或驴、或羊、仍在他手下存活、他就要加倍赔还。  
22:5 人若在田间、或在葡萄园里放牲畜、任凭牲畜上别人的田里去吃、就必拿自己田间上好的、和葡萄园上好的赔还。  

22:6 若点火焚烧荆棘、以致将别人堆积的禾捆、站着的禾稼、或是田园、都烧尽了、那点火的必要赔还。

22:8 若找不到贼、那家主必就近审判官、要看看他拿了原主的物件没有。  
22:9 两个人的案件、无论是为甚么过犯、或是为牛、为驴、为羊、为衣裳、或是为甚么失掉之物、有一人说、这是我的、两造就要将案件禀告审判官、审判官定谁有罪、谁就要加倍赔还。  
22:10 人若将驴、或牛、或羊、或别的牲畜、交付邻舍看守、牲畜或死、或受伤、或被赶去、无人看见、

22:11 那看守的人、要凭着耶和华起誓、手里未曾拿邻舍的物、本主就要罢休、看守的人不必赔还。  
22:12 牲畜若从看守的那里被偷去、他就要赔还本主。  
22:13 若被野兽撕碎、看守的要带来当作证据、所撕的不必赔还。  
22:14 人若向邻舍借甚么、所借的或受伤、或死、本主没有同在一处、借的人总要赔还。  
22:15 若本主同在一处、他就不必赔还。  若是雇的、也不必赔还、本是为雇价来的。  

22:16 人若引诱没有受聘的处女、与他行淫、他总要交出聘礼娶他为妻。  
22:17 若女子的父亲决不肯将女子给他、他就要按处女的聘礼、交出钱来。  
22:18 行邪术的女人、不可容他存活。  
22:19 凡与兽淫合的、总要把他治死。  
22:20 祭祀别神、不单单祭祀耶和华的、那人必要灭绝。  

22:21 不可亏负寄居的、也不可欺压他、因为你们在埃及地也作过寄居的。  
22:22 不可苦待寡妇和孤儿。  
22:23 若是苦待他们一点、他们向我一哀求、我总要听他们的哀声。  
22:24 并要发烈怒、用刀杀你们、使你们的妻子为寡妇、儿女为孤儿。  
22:25 我民中有贫穷人与你同住、你若借钱给他、不可如放债的向他取利。  

22:26 你即或拿邻舍的衣服作当头、必在日落以先归还他。  
22:27 因他只有这一件当盖头、是他盖身的衣服、若是没有、他拿甚么睡觉呢。  他哀求我、我就应允、因为我是有恩惠的。  
22:28 不可毁谤　神、也不可毁谤你百姓的官长。  
22:29 你要从你庄稼中的谷、和酒醡中滴出来的酒、拿来献上、不可迟延。  你要将头生的儿子归给我。  
22:30 你牛羊头生的、也要这样。  七天当跟着母、第八天要归给我。

## 出埃及记 23章    

23:1 不可随伙布散谣言、不可与恶人连手妄作见证。  
23:2 不可随众行恶。  不可在争讼的事上、随众偏行、作见证屈枉正直。  
23:3 也不可在争讼的事上、偏护穷人。  
23:4 若遇见你仇敌的牛、或驴、失迷了路、总要牵回来交给他。  
23:5 若看见恨你人的驴压卧在重驮之下、不可走开、务要和驴主一同抬开重驮。  

23:6 不可在穷人争讼的事上屈枉正直。  
23:7 当远离虚假的事。  不可杀无辜和有义的人、因我必不以恶人为义。  
23:8 不可受贿赂、因为贿赂能叫明眼人变瞎了、又能颠倒义人的话。  
23:9 不可欺压寄居的。  因为你们在埃及地作过寄居的、知道寄居的心。  
23:10 六年你要耕种田地、收藏土产、

23:11 只是第七年、要叫地歇息、不耕不种、使你民中的穷人有吃的、他们所剩下的、野兽可以吃。  你的葡萄园和橄榄园、也要照样办理。  
23:12 六日你要作工、第七日要安息、使牛、驴可以歇息、并使你婢女的儿子和寄居的、都可以舒畅。  
23:13 凡我对你们说的话、你们要谨守。  别神的名、你不可提、也不可从你口中传说。  
23:14 一年三次、你要向我守节。  
23:15 你要守除酵节、照我所吩咐你的、在亚笔月内所定的日期、吃无酵饼七天。  谁也不可空手朝见我、因为你是这月出了埃及。  

23:16 又要守收割节、所收的是你田间所种劳碌得来初熟之物。  并在年底收藏、要守收藏节。  
23:17 一切的男丁、要一年三次朝见主耶和华。  
23:18 不可将我祭牲的血、和有酵的饼、一同献上、也不可将我节上祭牲的脂油留到早晨。  
23:19 地里首先初熟之物、要送到耶和华你　神的殿。  不可用山羊羔母的奶煮山羊羔。  
23:20 看哪、我差遣使者在你前面、在路上保护你、领你到我所预备的地方去。  

23:21 他是奉我名来的、你们要在他面前谨慎、听从他的话、不可惹他、〔惹或作违背〕因为他必不赦免你们的过犯。  
23:22 你若实在听从他的话、照着我一切所说的去行、我就向你的仇敌作仇敌、向你的敌人作敌人。  
23:23 我的使者要在你前面行、领你到亚摩利人、赫人、比利洗人、迦南人、希未人、耶布斯人那里去。  我必将他们剪除。  
23:24 你不可跪拜他们的神、不可事奉他、也不可效法他们的行为、却要把神像尽行拆毁、打碎他们的柱像。  
23:25 你们要事奉耶和华你们的　神、他必赐福与你的粮、与你的水、也必从你们中间除去疾病。  

23:26 你境内必没有坠胎的、不生产的、我要使你满了你年日的数目。  
23:27 凡你所到的地方、我要使那里的众民、在你面前惊骇、扰乱、又要使你一切仇敌、转背逃跑。  
23:28 我要打发黄蜂飞在你前面、把希未人、迦南人、赫人、撵出去。  
23:29 我不在一年之内、将他们从你面前撵出去、恐怕地成为荒凉、野地的兽多起来害你。  
23:30 我要渐渐的将他们从你面前撵出去、等到你的人数加多、承受那地为业。  

23:31 我要定你的境界、从红海直到非利士海、又从旷野直到大河。  我要将那地的居民交在你手中、你要将他们从你面前撵出去。  
23:32 不可和他们并他们的神立约。  
23:33 他们不可住在你的地上、恐怕他们使你得罪我。  你若事奉他们的神、这必成为你的网罗。

24:9 摩西、亚伦、拿答、亚比户、并以色列长老中的七十人、都上了山。  
24:10 他们看见以色列的　神、他脚下彷彿有平铺的蓝宝石、如同天色明净。  

24:11 他的手不加害在以色列的尊者身上。  他们观看　神、他们又吃又喝。  
24:12 耶和华对摩西说、你上山到我这里来住在这里、我要将石版、并我所写的律法、和诫命、赐给你、使你可以教训百姓。  
24:13 摩西和他的帮手约书亚起来、上了　神的山、
24:14 摩西对长老说、你们在这里等着、等到我们再回来、有亚伦、户珥与你们同在、凡有争讼的、都可以就近他们去。  
24:15 摩西上山、有云彩把山遮盖。  

24:16 耶和华的荣耀停于西乃山、云彩遮盖山六天。  第七天他从云中召摩西。  
24:17 耶和华的荣耀在山顶上、在以色列人眼前、形状如烈火。  
24:18 摩西进入云中上山、在山上四十昼夜。

32:5 亚伦看见、就在牛犊面前筑坛、且宣告说、明日要向耶和华守节。  

32:6 次日清早、百姓起来献燔祭、和平安祭、就坐下吃喝、起来玩耍。  
32:7 耶和华吩咐摩西说、下去吧、因为你的百姓、就是你从埃及地领出来的、已经败坏了。  
32:8 他们快快偏离了我所吩咐的道、为自己铸了一只牛犊、向他下拜献祭、说、以色列阿、这就是领你出埃及地的神。  
32:9 耶和华对摩西说、我看这百姓真是硬着颈项的百姓。  
32:10 你且由着我、我要向他们发烈怒、将他们灭绝、使你的后裔成为大国。  

32:11 摩西便恳求耶和华他的　神说、耶和华阿、你为甚么向你的百姓发烈怒呢、这百姓是你用大力和大能的手、从埃及地领出来的。  
32:12 为甚么使埃及人议论说、他领他们出去、是要降祸与他们、把他们杀在山中、将他们从地上除灭。  求你转意、不发你的烈怒、后悔、不降祸与你的百姓。  
32:13 求你记念你的仆人亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列。  你曾指着自己起誓说、我必使你们的后裔像天上的星那样多、并且我所应许的这全地、必给你们的后裔、他们要永远承受为业。  
32:14 于是耶和华后悔、不把所说的祸降与他的百姓。  
32:15 摩西转身下山、手里拿着两块法版、这版是两面写的、这面那面都有字。  

32:16 是　神的工作、字是　神写的、刻在版上。  
32:17 约书亚一听见百姓呼喊的声音、就对摩西说、在营里有争战的声音。  
32:18 摩西说、这不是人打胜仗的声音、也不是人打败仗的声音、我所听见的、乃是人歌唱的声音。  
32:19 摩西挨近营前、就看见牛犊、又看见人跳舞、便发烈怒、把两块版扔在山下摔碎了。  
32:20 又将他们所铸的牛犊、用火焚烧、磨得粉碎、撒在水面上、叫以色列人喝。  

32:21 摩西对亚伦说、这百姓向你作了甚么、你竟使他们陷在大罪里。  
32:22 亚伦说、求我主不要发烈怒、这百姓专于作恶、是你知道的。  
32:23 他们对我说、你为我们作神像、可以在我们前面引路、因为领我们出埃及地的那个摩西、我们不知道他遭了甚么事。  
32:24 我对他们说、凡有金环的、可以摘下来、他们就给了我、我把金环扔在火中、这牛犊便出来了。  
32:25 摩西见百姓放肆、（亚伦纵容他们、使他们在仇敌中间被讥刺、)

32:26 就站在营门中、说、凡属耶和华的、都要到我这里来。  于是利未的子孙、都到他那里聚集。  
32:27 他对他们说、耶和华以色列的　神这样说、你们各人把刀跨在腰间、在营中往来、从这门到那门、各人杀他的弟兄、与同伴、并邻舍。  
32:28 利未的子孙照摩西的话行了。  那一天百姓中被杀的约有三千。  
32:29 摩西说、今天你们要自洁、归耶和华为圣、各人攻击他的儿子、和弟兄、使耶和华赐福与你们。  
32:30 到了第二天、摩西对百姓说、你们犯了大罪、我如今要上耶和华那里去、或者可以为你们赎罪。  

32:31 摩西回到耶和华那里、说、唉、这百姓犯了大罪、为自己作了金像。  
32:32 倘或你肯赦免他们的罪、。  。  。  不然、求你从你所写的册上涂抹我的名。  
32:33 耶和华对摩西说、谁得罪我、我就从我的册上涂抹谁的名。  
32:34 现在你去领这百姓、往我所告诉你的地方去、我的使者必在你前面引路。  只是到我追讨的日子、我必追讨他们的罪。  
32:35 耶和华杀百姓的缘故、是因他们同亚伦作了牛犊。

## 出埃及记 33章   

33:1 耶和华吩咐摩西说、我曾起誓应许亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各说、要将迦南地赐给你的后裔。  现在你和你从埃及地所领出来的百姓、要从这里往那地去。  
33:2 我要差遣使者在你前面、撵出迦南人、亚摩利人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人、
33:3 领你到那流奶与蜜之地。  我自己不同你们上去、因为你们是硬着颈项的百姓、恐怕我在路上把你们灭绝。  
33:4 百姓听见这凶信就悲哀、也没有人佩戴妆饰。  
33:5 耶和华对摩西说、你告诉以色列人说、耶和华说、你们是硬着颈项的百姓、我若一霎时临到你们中间、必灭绝你们现在你们要把身上的妆饰摘下来、使我可以知道怎样待你们。  

33:6 以色列人从住何烈山以后、就把身上的妆饰摘得干净。  
33:7 摩西素常将帐棚支搭在营外、离营却远、他称这帐棚为会幕。  凡求问耶和华的、就到营外的会幕那里去。  
33:8 当摩西出营到会幕去的时候、百姓就都起来、各人站在自己帐棚的门口、望着摩西、直等到他进了会幕。  
33:9 摩西进会幕的时候、云柱降下来、立在会幕的门前、耶和华便与摩西说话。  
33:10 众百姓看见云柱立在会幕门前、就都起来各人在自己帐棚的门口下拜。  

33:11 耶和华与摩西面对面说话、好像人与朋友说话一般。摩西转到营里去、惟有他的帮手一个少年人嫩的儿子约书亚、不离开会幕。  
33:12 摩西对耶和华说、你吩咐我说、将这百姓领上去、却没有叫我知道你要打发谁与我同去、只说、我按你的名认识你、你在我眼前也蒙了恩。  
33:13 我如今若在你眼前蒙恩、求你将你的道指示我、使我可以认识你、好在你眼前蒙恩。  求你想到这民是你的民。  
33:14 耶和华说、我必亲自和你同去、使你得安息。  
33:15 摩西说、你若不亲自和我同去、就不要把我们从这里领上去。  

33:16 人在何事上得以知道我和你的百姓、在你眼前蒙恩呢、岂不是因你与我们同去、使我和你的百姓、与地上的万民有分别么。  
33:17 耶和华对摩西说、你这所求的我也要行、因为你在我眼前蒙了恩、并且我按你的名认识你。  
33:18 摩西说、求你显出你的荣耀给我看。  
33:19 耶和华说、我要显我一切的恩慈、在你面前经过、宣告我的名。我要恩待谁、就恩待谁。要怜悯谁、就怜悯谁。  
33:20 又说、你不能看见我的面、因为人见我的面不能存活。  

33:21 耶和华说、看哪、在我这里有地方、你要站在磐石上。  
33:22 我的荣耀经过的时候、我必将你放在磐石穴中、用我的手遮掩你、等我过去。  
33:23 然后我要将我的手收回、你就得见我的背、却不得见我的面。

## 出埃及记 34章    

34:1 耶和华吩咐摩西说、你要凿出两块石版、和先前你摔碎的那版一样。  其上的字我要写在这版上。  
34:2 明日早晨、你要预备好了、上西乃山、在山顶上站在我面前。  
34:3 谁也不可和你一同上去、遍山都不可有人、在山根也不可叫羊群牛群吃草。  
34:4 摩西就凿出两块石版、和先前的一样。  清晨起来、照耶和华所吩咐的上西乃山去、手里拿着两块石版。  
34:5 耶和华在云中降临、和摩西一同站在那里、宣告耶和华的名。  

34:6 耶和华在他面前宣告说、耶和华、耶和华、是有怜悯、有恩典的　神、不轻易发怒、并有丰盛的慈爱和诚实。  
34:7 为千万人存留慈爱、赦免罪孽、过犯、和罪恶。  万不以有罪的为无罪、必追讨他的罪、自父及子、直到三四代。  
34:8 摩西急忙伏地下拜、
34:9 说、主阿、我若在你眼前蒙恩、求你在我们中间同行、因为这是硬着颈项的百姓。  又求你赦免我们的罪孽、和罪恶、以我们为你的产业。  
34:10 耶和华说、我要立约、要在百姓面前行奇妙的事、是在遍地万国中所未曾行的。  在你四围的外邦人、就要看见耶和华的作为、因我向你所行的是可畏惧的事。  

34:11 我今天所吩咐你的、你要谨守。  我要从你面前撵出亚摩利人、迦南人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人。  
34:12 你要谨慎、不可与你所去那地的居民立约、恐怕成为你们中间的网罗。  
34:13 却要拆毁他们的祭坛、打碎他们的柱像、砍下他们的木偶。  
34:14 不可敬拜别神、因为耶和华是忌邪的　神、名为忌邪者。  
34:15 只怕你与那地的居民立约、百姓随从他们的神、就行邪淫、祭祀他们的神、有人叫你、你便吃他的祭物、

34:16 又为你的儿子娶他们的女儿为妻、他们的女儿随从他们的神就行邪淫、使你的儿子也随从他们的神行邪淫。  
34:17 不可为自己铸造神像。  
34:18 你要守除酵节、照我所吩咐你的、在亚笔月内所定的日期、吃无酵饼七天、因为你是这亚笔月内出了埃及。  
34:19 凡头生的都是我的、一切牲畜头生的、无论是牛是羊、公的都是我的。  
34:20 头生的驴、要用羊羔代赎、若不代赎、就要打折他的颈项。  凡头生的儿子都要赎出来。  谁也不可空手朝见我。  

34:21 你六日要作工、第七日要安息、虽在耕种收割的时候、也要安息。  
34:22 在收割初熟麦子的时候、要守七七节。  又在年底要守收藏节。  
34:23 你们一切男丁、要一年三次朝见主耶和华以色列的　神。  
34:24 我要从你面前赶出外邦人、扩张你的境界。  你一年三次上去朝见耶和华你　神的时候、必没有人贪慕你的地土。  
34:25 你不可将我祭物的血、和有酵的饼、一同献上。  逾越节的祭物、也不可留到早晨。  

34:26 地里首先初熟之物、要送到耶和华你　神的殿。  不可用山羊羔母的奶、煮山羊羔。  
34:27 耶和华吩咐摩西说、你要将这些话写上、因为我是按这话与你和以色列人立约。  
34:28 摩西在耶和华那里四十昼夜、也不吃饭、也不喝水。  耶和华将这约的话、就是十条诫、写在两块版上。  
34:29 摩西手里拿着两块法版下、西乃山的时候、不知道自己的面皮、因耶和华和他说话就发了光。  
34:30 亚伦和以色列众人看见摩西的面皮发光、就怕挨近他。  

34:31 摩西叫他们来、于是亚伦和会众的官长都到他那里去、摩西就与他们说话。  
34:32 随后以色列众人都近前来、他就把耶和华在西乃山与他所说的一切话、都吩咐他们。  
34:33 摩西与他们说完了话、就用帕子蒙上脸。  
34:34 但摩西进到耶和华面前与他说话、就揭去帕子、及至出来的时候、便将耶和华所吩咐的告诉以色列人。  
34:35 以色列人看见摩西的面皮发光、摩西又用帕子蒙上脸、等到他进去与耶和华说话就揭去帕子。

40:2 正月初一日、你要立起帐幕。  
40:3 把法柜安放在里面、用幔子将柜遮掩。  
40:4 把桌子搬进去、摆设上面的物。  把灯台搬进去、点其上的灯。  
40:5 把烧香的金坛、安在法柜前、挂上帐幕的门帘。  

40:6 把燔祭坛、安在帐幕门前。  
40:7 把洗濯盆、安在会幕和坛的中间、在盆里盛水。  
40:8 又在四围立院帷、把院子的门帘挂上。  
40:9 用膏油把帐幕和其中所有的都抹上、使帐幕和一切器具成圣、就都成圣。  
40:10 又要抹燔祭坛、和一切器具使坛成圣、就都成为至圣。  

40:11 要抹洗濯盆、和盆座、使盆成圣。

40:13 要给亚伦穿上圣衣、又膏他使他成圣、可以给我供祭司的职分。  
40:14 又要使他儿子来、给他们穿上内袍。  
40:15 怎样膏他们的父亲、也要照样膏他们、使他们给我供祭司的职分。  他们世世代代凡受膏的、就永远当祭司的职任。  

40:16 摩西这样行、都是照耶和华所吩咐他的。  
40:17 第二年正月初一日、帐幕就立起来。  
40:18 摩西立起帐幕、安上带卯的座、立上板、穿上闩、立起柱子。  
40:19 在帐幕以上搭罩棚、把罩棚的顶盖、盖在其上。  是照耶和华所吩咐他的。  
40:20 又把法版放在柜里、把杠穿在柜的两旁、把施恩座安在柜上。  

40:21 把柜抬进帐幕、挂上遮掩柜的幔子、把法柜遮掩了。  是照耶和华所吩咐他的。  
40:22 又把桌子安在会幕内、在帐幕北边、在幔子外、
40:23 在桌子上将饼陈设在耶和华面前。  是照耶和华所吩咐他的。  
40:24 又把灯台安在会幕内、在帐幕南边、与桌子相对、
40:25 在耶和华面前点灯。  是照耶和华所吩咐他的。

40:33 在帐幕和坛的四围、立了院帷、把院子的门帘挂上。  这样摩西就完了工。  
40:34 当时云彩遮盖会幕、耶和华的荣光就充满了帐幕。  
40:35 摩西不能进会幕、因为云彩停在其上、并且耶和华的荣光、充满了帐幕。  

40:36 每逢云彩从帐幕收上去、以色列人就起程前往。  
40:37 云彩若不收上去、他们就不起程、直等到云彩收上去。  
40:38 日间耶和华的云彩、是在帐幕以上。  夜间云中有火、在以色列全家的眼前、在他们所行的路上、都是这样。
