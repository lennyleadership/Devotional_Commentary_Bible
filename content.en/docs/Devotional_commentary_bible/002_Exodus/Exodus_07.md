7:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.  
7:2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.  
7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.  
7:4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.  
7:5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.  

7:6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.  
7:7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.  
7:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,  
7:9 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.  
7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.  

7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.  
7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.  
7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.  
7:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.  
7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.  

7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.  
7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.  
7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.  
7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.  
7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.  

7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.  
7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.  
7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.  
7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.  
7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.

7:1 耶和华对摩西说、我使你在法老面前代替　神、你的哥哥亚伦是替你说话的。  
7:2 凡我所吩咐你的、你都要说、你的哥哥亚伦要对法老说、容以色列人出他的地。  
7:3 我要使法老的心刚硬、也要在埃及地多行神迹奇事。  
7:4 但法老必不听你们、我要伸手重重地刑罚埃及、将我的军队以色列民从埃及地领出来。  
7:5 我伸手攻击埃及、将以色列人从他们中间领出来的时候、埃及人就要知道我是耶和华。  

7:6 摩西亚伦这样行、耶和华怎样吩咐他们、他们就照样行了。  
7:7 摩西亚伦与法老说话的时候、摩西八十岁、亚伦八十三岁。  
7:8 耶和华晓谕摩西亚伦说、
7:9 法老若对你们说、你们行件奇事吧、你就吩咐亚伦说、把杖丢在法老面前、使杖变作蛇。  
7:10 摩西亚伦进去见法老、就照耶和华所吩咐的行、亚伦把杖丢在法老和臣仆面前、杖就变作蛇。  

7:11 于是法老召了博士和术士来、他们是埃及行法术的、也用邪术照样而行。  
7:12 他们各人丢下自己的杖、杖就变作蛇、但亚伦的杖吞了他们的杖。  
7:13 法老心里刚硬、不肯听从摩西亚伦、正如耶和华所说的。  
7:14 耶和华对摩西说、法老心里固执、不肯容百姓去。  
7:15 明日早晨他出来往水边去、你要往河边迎接他、手里要拿着那变过蛇的杖、

7:16 对他说、耶和华希伯来人的　神打发我来见你、说、容我的百姓去、好在旷野事奉我、到如今你还是不听。  
7:17 耶和华这样说、我要用我手里的杖击打河中的水、水就变作血、因此、你必知道我是耶和华。  
7:18 河里的鱼必死、河也要腥臭、埃及人就要厌恶吃这河里的水。  
7:19 耶和华晓谕摩西说、你对亚伦说、把你的杖伸在埃及所有的水以上、就是在他们的江、河、池、塘以上、叫水都变作血、在埃及遍地、无论在木器中、石器中、都必有血。  
7:20 摩西亚伦就照耶和华所吩咐的行、亚伦在法老和臣仆眼前举杖击打河里的水、河里的水、都变作血了。  

7:21 河里的鱼死了、河也腥臭了、埃及人就不能吃这河里的水。  埃及遍地都有了血。  
7:22 埃及行法术的、也用邪术照样而行。  法老心里刚硬、不肯听摩西亚伦、正如耶和华所说的。  
7:23 法老转身进宫、也不把这事放在心上。  
7:24 埃及人都在河的两边挖地、要得水喝、因为他们不能喝这河里的水。  
7:25 耶和华击打河以后满了七天。
