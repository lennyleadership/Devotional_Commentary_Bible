4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.  
4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.  
4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.  
4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:  
4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.  

4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.  
4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.  
4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.  
4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.  
4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.  

4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?  
4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.  
4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.  
4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.  
4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.  

4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.  
4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.  
4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.  
4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.  
4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.  

4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.  
4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:  
4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.  
4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.  
4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.  

4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.  
4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.  
4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.  
4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:  
4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.  

4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

4:1 摩西回答说、他们必不信我、也不听我的话、必说、耶和华并没有向你显现。  
4:2 耶和华对摩西说、你手里是甚么。  他说、是杖。  
4:3 耶和华说、丢在地上、他一丢下去、就变作蛇、摩西便跑开。  
4:4 耶和华对摩西说、伸出手来、拿住他的尾巴、他必在你手中仍变为杖。  
4:5 如此好叫他们信耶和华他们祖宗的　神、就是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神、是向你显现了。  

4:6 耶和华又对他说、把手放在怀里、他就把手放在怀里、及至抽出来、不料、手长了大痲疯、有雪那样白。  
4:7 耶和华说、再把手放在怀里、他就再把手放在怀里、及至从怀里抽出来、不料、手已经复原、与周身的肉一样。  
4:8 又说、倘或他们不听你的话、也不信头一个神迹、他们必信第二个神迹。  
4:9 这两个神迹若都不信、也不听你的话、你就从河里取些水、倒在旱地上、你从河里取的水必在旱地上变作血。  
4:10 摩西对耶和华说、主阿、我素日不是能言的人、就是从你对仆人说话以后、也是这样、我本是拙口笨舌的。  

4:11 耶和华对他说、谁造人的口呢、谁使人口哑、耳聋、目明、眼瞎呢、岂不是我耶和华么。  
4:12 现在去吧、我必赐你口才、指教你所当说的话。  
4:13 摩西说、主阿、你愿意打发谁、就打发谁去吧。  
4:14 耶和华向摩西发怒说、不是有你的哥哥利未人亚伦么、我知道他是能言的、现在他出来迎接你、他一见你心里就欢喜。  
4:15 你要将当说的话传给他、我也要赐你和他口才、又要指教你们所当行的事。  

4:16 他要替你对百姓说话、你要以他当作口、他要以你当作　神。  
4:17 你手里要拿这杖、好行神迹。  
4:18 于是摩西回到他岳父叶忒罗那里、对他说、求你容我回去见我在埃及的弟兄、看他们还在不在。  叶忒罗对摩西说、你可以平平安安的去吧。  
4:19 耶和华在米甸对摩西说、你要回埃及去、因为寻索你命的人都死了。  
4:20 摩西就带着妻子和两个儿子、叫他们骑上驴回埃及地去。  摩西手里拿着　神的杖。  

4:21 耶和华对摩西说、你回到埃及的时候要留意、将我指示你的一切奇事、行在法老面前、但我要使〔或作任凭下同〕他的心刚硬、他必不容百姓去。  
4:22 你要对法老说、耶和华这样说、以色列是我的儿子、我的长子。  
4:23 我对你说过、容我的儿子去好事奉我、你还是不肯容他去、看哪、我要杀你的长子。  
4:24 摩西在路上住宿的地方、耶和华遇见他、想要杀他。  
4:25 西坡拉就拿一块火石割下他儿子的阳皮、丢在摩西脚前、说、你真是我的血郎了。  

4:26 这样耶和华才放了他。  西坡拉说、你因割礼就是血郎了。  
4:27 耶和华对亚伦说、你往旷野去迎接摩西、他就去、在　神的山遇见摩西和他亲嘴。  
4:28 摩西将耶和华打发他所说的言语、和嘱咐他所行的神迹、都告诉了亚伦。  
4:29 摩西亚伦就去招聚以色列的众长老。  
4:30 亚伦将耶和华对摩西所说的一切话、述说了一遍、又在百姓眼前行了那些神迹。  

4:31 百姓就信了。  以色列人听见耶和华眷顾他们、鉴察他们的困苦、就低头下拜。
