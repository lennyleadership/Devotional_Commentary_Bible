11:1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.  
11:2 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,  
11:3 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;  
11:4 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;  
11:5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;  

11:6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:  
11:7 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.  
11:8 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;  
11:9 And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.  
11:10 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:  

11:11 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:   
11:12 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. <a class = "marginnote">verse 11-12: It is an illustration of a believer's life which is blessed</a>  
11:13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,  
11:14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.  
11:15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.  

11:16 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;  
11:17 And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.  
11:18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.  
11:19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.  
11:20 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:  

11:21 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.  
11:22 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;  
11:23 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.  
11:24 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.  
11:25 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.  

11:26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;  
11:27 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:  
11:28 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.  
11:29 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.  
11:30 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?  

11:31 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.  
11:32 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.

11:1 你要爱耶和华你的　神、常守他的吩咐、律例、典章、诫命。  
11:2 你们今日当知道、我本不是和你们的儿女说话、因为他们不知道、也没有看见耶和华你们　神的管教、威严、大能的手、和伸出来的膀臂、
11:3 并他在埃及中向埃及王法老、和其全地所行的神迹奇事、
11:4 也没有看见他怎样待埃及的军兵、车马、他们追赶你们的时候、耶和华怎样使红海的水淹没他们、将他们灭绝直到今日。  
11:5 并他在旷野怎样待你们、以致你们来到这地方。  

11:6 也没有看见他怎样待流便子孙以利押的儿子、大坍、亚比兰、地怎样在以色列人中间开口吞了他们、和他们的家眷、并帐棚、与跟他们的一切活物。  
11:7 惟有你们亲眼看见耶和华所作的一切大事。  
11:8 所以你们要守我今日所吩咐的一切诫命、使你们胆壮、能以进去、得你们所要得的那地。  
11:9 并使你们的日子、在耶和华向你们列祖起誓应许给他们、和他们后裔的地上、得以长久。  那是流奶与蜜之地。  
11:10 你要进去得为业的那地、本不像你出来的埃及地、你在那里撒种、用脚浇灌、像浇灌菜园一样。  

11:11 你们要过去得为业的那地、乃是有山、有谷、雨水滋润之地。  
11:12 是耶和华你　神所眷顾的、从岁首到年终、耶和华你　神的眼目时常看顾那地。  
11:13 你们若留意听从我今日所吩咐的诫命、爱耶和华你们的　神、尽心、尽性、事奉他、
11:14 他〔原文作我〕必按时降秋雨春雨、在你们的地上、使你们可以收藏五谷、新酒、和油。  
11:15 也必使你吃得饱足、并使田野为你的牲畜长草。  

11:16 你们要谨慎、免得心中受迷惑、就偏离正路、去事奉敬拜别神。  
11:17 耶和华的怒气向你们发作、就使天闭塞不下雨、地也不出产、使你们在耶和华所赐给你们的美地上、速速灭亡。  
11:18 你们要将我这话存在心内、留在意中、系在手上为记号、戴在额上为经文、
11:19 也要教训你们的儿女、无论坐在家里、行在路上、躺下、起来、都要谈论。  
11:20 又要写在房屋的门框上、并城门上、

11:21 使你们和你们子孙的日子、在耶和华向你们列祖起誓应许给他们的地上、得以增多、如天覆地的日子那样多。  
11:22 你们若留意谨守遵行我所吩咐这一切的诫命、爱耶和华你们的　神、行他的道、专靠他、
11:23 他必从你们面前赶出这一切国民、就是比你们更大更强的国民、你们也要得他们的地。  
11:24 凡你们脚掌所踏之地、都必归你们、从旷野和利巴嫩、并伯拉大河、直到西海、都要作你们的境界。  
11:25 必无一人能在你们面前站立得住。  耶和华你们的　神、必照他所说的、使惧怕惊恐临到你们所踏之地的居民。  

11:26 看哪、我今日将祝福与咒诅的话、都陈明在你们面前。  
11:27 你们若听从耶和华你们　神的诫命、就是我今日所吩咐你们的、就必蒙福。  
11:28 你们若不听从耶和华你们　神的诫命、偏离我今日所吩咐你们的道、去事奉你们素来所不认识的别神、就必受祸。  
11:29 及至耶和华你的　神领你进入要去得为业的那地、你就要将祝福的话陈明在基利心山上、将咒诅的话陈明在以巴路山上。  
11:30 这二山岂不是在约但河那边、日落之处、在住亚拉巴的迦南人之地、与吉甲相对、靠近摩利橡树么。  

11:31 你们要过约但河、进去得耶和华你们　神所赐你们为业之地、在那地居住。  
11:32 你们要谨守遵行我今日在你们面前所陈明的一切律例、典章。
