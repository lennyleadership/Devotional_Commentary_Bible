3:1 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:  
3:2 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.  
3:3 But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.  
3:4 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.  
3:5 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.  
 
3:6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.  
3:7 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;  
3:8 Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:  
3:9 Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.  
3:10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.  
 
3:11 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.  
3:12 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.  
3:13 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.  
3:14 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.  
3:15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.  
 
3:16 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.  
3:17 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.  
3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

3:1 弟兄们、我还有话说 。请你们为我们祷告、好叫主的道理快快行开、得着荣耀、正如在你们中间一样 。  
3:2 也叫我们脱离无理之恶人的手 。因为人不都是有信心。  
3:3 但主是信实的、要坚固你们、保护你们脱离那恶者〔或作脱离凶恶〕。  
3:4 我们靠主深信你们现在是遵行我们所吩咐的、后来也必要遵行。  
3:5 愿主引导你们的心、叫你们爱　神并学基督的忍耐。  
 
3:6 弟兄们、我们奉主耶稣基督的名吩咐你们、凡有弟兄不按规矩而行、不遵守从我们所受的教训、就当远离他。  
3:7 你们自己原知道应当怎样效法我们 。因为我们在你们中间、未尝不按规矩而行 。  
3:8 也未尝白吃人的饭 。倒是辛苦劳碌、昼夜作工、免得叫你们一人受累。  
3:9 这并不是因我们没有权柄、乃是要给你们作榜样、叫你们效法我们。  
3:10 我们在你们那里的时候、曾吩咐你们说、若有人不肯作工、就不可吃饭。  
 
3:11 因我们听说、在你们中间有人不按规矩而行、甚么工都不作、反倒专管闲事。  
3:12 我们靠主耶稣基督、吩咐劝戒这样的人、要安静作工、吃自己的饭。  
3:13 弟兄们、你们行善不可丧志。  
3:14 若有人不听从我们这信上的话、要记下他、不和他交往、叫他自觉羞愧。  
3:15 但不要以他为仇人、要劝他如弟兄。  
 
3:16 愿赐平安的主、随时随事亲自给你们平安 。愿主常与你们众人同在。  
3:17 我保罗亲笔问你们安 。凡我的信都以此为记 。我的笔迹就是这样。  
3:18 愿我们主耶稣基督的恩、常与你们众人同在。
