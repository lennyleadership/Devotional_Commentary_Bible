2:1 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,  
2:2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.  
2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;  
2:4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.  
2:5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?  
 
2:6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.  
2:7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.  
2:8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:  
2:9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,  
2:10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.  
 
2:11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:  
2:12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.  
2:13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:  
2:14 Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
2:15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.  
 
2:16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,  
2:17 Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.

2:1 弟兄们、论到我们主耶稣基督降临、和我们到他那里聚集、  
2:2 我劝你们、无论有灵、有言语、有冒我名的书信、说主的日子现在到了、〔现在或作就〕不要轻易动心、也不要惊慌。  
2:3 人不拘用甚么法子、你们总不要被他诱惑 。因为那日子以前、必有离道反教的事 。并有那大罪人、就是沉沦之子、显露出来 。  
2:4 他是抵挡主、高抬自己、超过一切称为　神的、和一切受人敬拜的 。甚至坐在　神的殿里、自称是　神。  
2:5 我还在你们那里的时候、曾把这些事告诉你们、你们不记得么。  
 
2:6 现在你们也知道那拦阻他的是甚么、是叫他到了的时候、才可以显露 。  
2:7 因为那不法的隐意已经发动 。只是现在有一个拦阻的、等到那拦阻的被除去 。  
2:8 那时这不法的人、必显露出来 。主耶稣要用口中的气灭绝他、用降临的荣光废掉他。  
2:9 这不法的人来、是照撒但的运动、行各样的异能神迹、和一切虚假的奇事、  
2:10 并且在那沉沦的人身上、行各样出于不义的诡诈 。因他们不领受爱真理的心、使他们得救。  
 
2:11 故此、　神就给他们一个生发错误的心、叫他们信从虚谎 。  
2:12 使一切不信真理、倒喜爱不义的人、都被定罪。  
2:13 主所爱的弟兄们哪、我们本该常为你们感谢　神 。因为他从起初拣选了你们、叫你们因信真道、又被圣灵感动成为圣洁、能以得救。  
2:14 　神借我们所传的福音、召你们到这地步、好得着我们主耶稣基督的荣光。  
2:15 所以弟兄们、你们要站立得稳、凡所领受的教训、不拘是我们口传的、是信上写的、都要坚守。  
 
2:16 但愿我们主耶稣基督、和那爱我们、开恩将永远的安慰、并美好的盼望、赐给我们的父　神、  
2:17 安慰你们的心、并且在一切善行善言上、坚固你们。
