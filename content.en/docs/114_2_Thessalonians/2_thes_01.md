1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:  
1:2 Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
1:3 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;  
1:4 So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:  
1:5 Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:  
 
1:6 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;  
1:7 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,  
1:8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:  
1:9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;  
1:10 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.  
 
1:11 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:  
1:12 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

1:1 保罗、西拉、提摩太、写信给帖撒罗尼迦在　神我们的父与主耶稣基督里的教会 。  
1:2 愿恩惠平安、从父　神和主耶稣基督、归与你们。  
1:3 弟兄们、我们该为你们常常感谢　神、这本是合宜的 。因你们的信心格外增长、并且你们众人彼此相爱的心也都充足 。  
1:4 甚至我们在　神的各教会里为你们夸口、都因你们在所受的一切逼迫患难中、仍旧存忍耐和信心 。  
1:5 这正是　神公义判断的明证 。叫你们可算配得　神的国、你们就是为这国受苦。  
 
1:6 　神既是公义的、就必将患难报应那加患难给你们的人 。  
1:7 也必使你们这受患难的人、与我们同得平安 。那时、主耶稣同他有能力的天使、从天上在火焰中显现、  
1:8 要报应那不认识　神、和那不听从我主耶稣福音的人。  
1:9 他们要受刑罚、就是永远沉沦、离开主的面和他权能的荣光 。  
1:10 这正是主降临要在他圣徒的身上得荣耀、又在一切信的人身上显为希奇的那日子 。（我们对你们作的见证、你们也信了。)
 
1:11 因此、我们常为你们祷告、愿我们的　神看你们配得过所蒙的召 。又用大能成就你们一切所羡慕的良善、和一切因信心所作的工夫 。  
1:12 叫我们主耶稣的名、在你们身上得荣耀、你们也在他身上得荣耀、都照着我们的　神并主耶稣基督的恩。
