6:1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,  
6:2 Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.  
6:3 And this will we do, if God permit.  
6:4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,  
6:5 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,  

6:6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.  
6:7 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:  
6:8 But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.  
6:9 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.  
6:10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.  

6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:  
6:12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  
6:13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,  
6:14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.  
6:15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.  

6:16 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.  
6:17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:  
6:18 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:  
6:19 Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;  
6:20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

6:1 所以我们应当离开基督道理的开端、竭力进到完全的地步。不必再立根基、就如那懊悔死行、信靠　神、  
6:2 各样洗礼、按手之礼、死人复活、以及永远审判、各等教训。  
6:3 神若许我们、我们必如此行。  
6:4 论到那些已经蒙了光照、尝过天恩的滋味、又于圣灵有分、  
6:5 并尝过　神善道的滋味、觉悟来世权能的人、  
 
6:6 若是离弃道理、就不能叫他们从新懊悔了。因为他们把　神的儿子重钉十字架、明明的羞辱他。  
6:7 就如一块田地、吃过屡次下的雨水、生长菜蔬合乎耕种的人用、就从　神得福。  
6:8 若长荆棘和蒺藜、必被废弃、近于咒诅、结局就是焚烧。  
6:9 亲爱的弟兄们、我们虽是这样说、却深信你们的行为强过这些、而且近乎得救。  
6:10 因为　神并非不公义、竟忘记你们所作的工、和你们为他名所显的爱心、就是先前伺候圣徒、如今还是伺候。  
 
6:11 我们愿你们各人都显出这样的殷勤、使你们有满足的指望、一直到底。  
6:12 并且不懈怠。总要效法那些凭信心和忍耐承受应许的人。  
6:13 当初　神应许亚伯拉罕的时候、因为没有比自己更大可以指着起誓的、就指着自己起誓、说、  
6:14 『论福、我必赐大福给你。论子孙、我必叫你的子孙多起来。』  
6:15 这样、亚伯拉罕既恒久忍耐、就得了所应许的。  
 
6:16 人都是指着比自己大的起誓。并且以起誓为实据、了结各样的争论。  
6:17 照样、　神愿意为那承受应许的人、格外显明他的旨意是不更改的、就起誓为证。  
6:18 借这两件不更改的事、　神决不能说谎、好叫我们这逃往避难所、持定摆在我们前头指望的人、可以大得勉励。  
6:19 我们有这指望如同灵魂的锚、又坚固又牢靠、且通入幔内。  
6:20 作先锋的耶稣、既照着麦基洗德的等次、成了永远的大祭司、就为我们进入幔内。
