7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;  
7:2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;  
7:3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.  
7:4 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.  
7:5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:  

7:6 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.  
7:7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.  
7:8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.  
7:9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.  
7:10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.  

7:11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?  
7:12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.  
7:13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.  
7:14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.  
7:15 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,  

7:16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.  
7:17 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  
7:18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.  
7:19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.  
7:20 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:  

7:21 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)  
7:22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.  
7:23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:  
7:24 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.  
7:25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.  

7:26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;  
7:27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.  
7:28 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.

7:1 这麦基洗德、就是撒冷王、又是至高　神的祭司、本是长远为祭司的。他当亚伯拉罕杀败诸王回来的时候、就迎接他、给他祝福。  
7:2 亚伯拉罕也将自己所得来的、取十分之一给他。他头一个名翻出来、就是仁义王、他又名撒冷王、就是平安王的意思。  
7:3 他无父、无母、无族谱、无生之始、无命之终、乃是与　神的儿子相似。  
7:4 你们想一想、先祖亚伯拉罕、将自己所掳来上等之物取十分之一给他、这人是何等尊贵呢。  
7:5 那得祭司职任的利未子孙、领命照例向百姓取十分之一、这百姓是自己的弟兄、虽是从亚伯拉罕身中生的、〔身原文作腰〕还是照例取十分之一。  
 
7:6 独有麦基洗德、不与他们同谱、倒收纳亚伯拉罕的十分之一、为那蒙应许的亚伯拉罕祝福。  
7:7 从来位分大的给位分小的祝福、这是驳不倒的理。  
7:8 在这里收十分之一的都是必死的人。但在那里收十分之一的、有为他作见证的说、他是活的。  
7:9 并且可说、那受十分之一的利未、也是借着亚伯拉罕纳了十分之一。  
7:10 因为麦基洗德迎接亚伯拉罕的时候、利未已经在他先祖的身中。〔身原文作腰〕
 
7:11 从前百姓在利未人祭司职任以下受律法、倘若借这职任能得完全、又何用另外兴起一位祭司、照麦基洗德的等次、不照亚伦的等次呢。  
7:12 祭司的职任既已更改、律法也必须更改。  
7:13 因为这话所指的人、本属别的支派、那支派里从来没有一人伺候祭坛。  
7:14 我们的主分明是从犹大出来的。但这支派、摩西并没有提到祭司。  
7:15 倘若照麦基洗德的样式、另外兴起一位祭司来、我的话更是显而易见的了。  
 
7:16 他成为祭司、并不是照属肉体的条例、乃是照无穷之生命的大能。〔无穷原文作不能毁坏〕
7:17 因为有给他作见证的说、『你是照着麦基洗德的等次永远为祭司。』  
7:18 先前的条例、因软弱无益、所以废掉了。  
7:19 （律法原来一无所成)就引进了更美的指望、靠这指望我们便可以进到　神面前。  
7:20 再者、耶稣为祭司、并不是不起誓立的。  
 
7:21 至于那些祭司、原不是起誓立的、只有耶稣是起誓立的。因为那立他的对他说、『主起了誓决不后悔、你是永远为祭司。』  
7:22 既是起誓立的、耶稣就作了更美之约的中保。  
7:23 那些成为祭司的、数目本来多、是因为有死阻隔不能长久。  
7:24 这位既是永远常存的、他祭司的职任、就长久不更换。  
7:25 凡靠着他进到　神面前的人、他都能拯救到底。因为他是长远活着、替他们祈求。  
 
7:26 像这样圣洁、无邪恶、无玷污、远离罪人、高过诸天的大祭司、原是与我们合宜的。  
7:27 他不像那些大祭司、每日必须先为自己的罪、后为百姓的罪献祭、因为他只一次将自己献上、就把这事成全了。  
7:28 律法本是立软弱的人为大祭司。但在律法以后起誓的话、是立儿子为大祭司、乃是成全到永远的。
