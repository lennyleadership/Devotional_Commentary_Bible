12:1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,  
12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.  
12:3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.  
12:4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.  
12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:  

12:6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.  
12:7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?  
12:8 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.  
12:9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?  
12:10 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.  

12:11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.  
12:12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;  
12:13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.  
12:14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:  
12:15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;  

12:16 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.  
12:17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.  
12:18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,  
12:19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:  
12:20 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:  

12:21 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)  
12:22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,  
12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,  
12:24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.  
12:25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:  

12:26 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.  
12:27 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.  
12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:  
12:29 For our God is a consuming fire.

12:1 我们既有这许多的见证人、如同云彩围着我们、就当放下各样的重担、脱去容易缠累我们的罪、存心忍耐、奔那摆在我们前头的路程、  
12:2 仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣。〔或作仰望那将真道创始成终的耶稣〕他因那摆在前面的喜乐、就轻看羞辱、忍受了十字架的苦难、便坐在　神宝座的右边。<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">喜乐：以 賽 亞 書 53:11 CUVS  
他 必 看 见 自 己 劳 苦 的 功 效 ， 便 心 满 意 足 。 有 许 多 人 因 认 识 我 的 义 仆 得 称 为 义 ； 并 且 他 要 担 当 他 们 的 罪 孽 。  
Isaiah 53:11 NKJV  
He shall see the labor of His soul, and be satisfied. By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many, For He shall bear their iniquities.

12:3 那忍受罪人这样顶撞的、你们要思想、免得疲倦灰心。  
12:4 你们与罪恶相争、还没有抵挡到流血的地步。  
12:5 你们又忘了那劝你们如同劝儿子的话、说、『我儿、你不可轻看主的管教、被他责备的时候、也不可灰心。  
 
12:6 因为主所爱的他必管教、又鞭打凡所收纳的儿子。』  
12:7 你们所忍受的、是　神管教你们、待你们如同待儿子。焉有儿子不被父亲管教的呢。  
12:8 管教原是众子所共受的、你们若不受管教、就是私子、不是儿子了。  
12:9 再者、我们曾有生身的父管教我们、我们尚且敬重他、何况万灵的父、我们岂不更当顺服他得生么。  
12:10 生身的父都是暂随己意管教我们。惟有万灵的父管教我们、是要我们得益处、使我们在他的圣洁上有分。  
 
12:11 凡管教的事、当时不觉得快乐、反觉得愁苦。后来却为那经练过的人、结出平安的果子、就是义。  
12:12 所以你们要把下垂的手、发酸的腿、挺起来。  
12:13 也要为自己的脚把道路修直了、使瘸子不至歪脚、反得痊癒。〔歪脚或作差路〕  
12:14 你们要追求与众人和睦、并要追求圣洁。非圣洁没有人能见主。  
12:15 又要谨慎、恐怕有人失了　神的恩。恐怕有毒根生出来扰乱你们、因此叫众人沾染污秽。  
 
12:16 恐怕有淫乱的、有贪恋世俗如以扫的。他因一点食物把自己长子的名分卖了。  
12:17 后来想要承受父所祝的福、竟被弃绝、虽然号哭切求、却得不着门路、使他父亲的心意回转、这是你们知道的。  
12:18 你们原不是来到那能摸的山、此山有火焰、密云、黑暗、暴风、  
12:19 角声与说话的声音。那些听见这声音的、都求不要再向他们说话。  
12:20 因为他们当不起所命他们的话、说、『靠近这山的、即便是走兽、也要用石头打死。』  
 
12:21 所见的极其可怕、甚至摩西说、『我甚是恐惧战兢。』  
12:22 你们乃是来到锡安山、永生　神的城邑、就是天上的耶路撒冷。那里有千万的天使、  
12:23 有名录在天上诸长子之会所共聚的总会、有审判众人的　神、和被成全之义人的灵魂、  
12:24 并新约的中保耶稣、以及所洒的血。这血所说的比亚伯的血所说的更美。  
12:25 你们总要谨慎、不可弃绝那向你们说话的。因为那些弃绝在地上警戒他们的、尚且不能逃罪、何况我们违背那从天上警戒我们的呢。  
 
12:26 当时他的声音震动了地。但如今他应许说、『再一次我不单要震动地、还要震动天。』  
12:27 这再一次的话、是指明被震动的、就是受造之物、都要挪去、使那不被震动的常存。  
12:28 所以我们既得了不能震动的国、就当感恩、照　神所喜悦的、用虔诚敬畏的心事奉　神。  
12:29 因为我们的　神乃是烈火。
