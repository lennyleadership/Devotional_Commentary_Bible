12:1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.  
12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.  
12:3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.  
12:4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:  
12:5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.  

12:6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;  
12:7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;  
12:8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.  
12:9 Let <a class ="blue">love</a> be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.  
12:10 Be kindly <a class ="blue">affectioned</a> one to another with <a class ="blue">brotherly love</a>; in honour preferring one another;  

12:11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;  
12:12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;  
12:13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.  
12:14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.  
12:15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.  

12:16 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.  
12:17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.  
12:18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.  
12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.  
12:20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.  

12:21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

12:1 所以弟兄们、我以　神的慈悲劝你们、将身体献上、当作活祭、是圣洁的、是　神所喜悦的。你们如此事奉、乃是理所当然的。  
12:2 不要效法这个世界。只要心意更新而变化、叫你们察验何为　神的善良、纯全可喜悦的旨意。  
12:3 我凭着所赐我的恩、对你们各人说、不要看自己过于所当看的。要照着　神所分给各人信心的大小、看得合乎中道。  
12:4 正如我们一个身子上有好些肢体、肢体也不都是一样的用处。  
12:5 我们这许多人、在基督里成为一身、互相联络作肢体、也是如此。  

12:6 按我们所得的恩赐、各有不同。或说预言、就当照着信心的程度说预言。  
12:7 或作执事、就当专一执事。或作教导的、就当专一教导。  
12:8 或作劝化的、就当专一劝化。施舍的、就当诚实。治理的、就当殷勤。怜悯人的、就当甘心。  
12:9 爱人不可虚假、恶要厌恶、善要亲近。  
12:10 爱弟兄、要彼此亲热。恭敬人、要彼此推让。  

12:11 殷勤不可懒惰。要心里火热。常常服事主。  
12:12 在指望中要喜乐。在患难中要忍耐。祷告要恒切。  
12:13 圣徒缺乏要帮补。客要一味的款待。  
12:14 逼迫你们的、要给他们祝福。只要祝福、不可咒诅。  
12:15 与喜乐的人要同乐。与哀哭的人要同哭。  

12:16 要彼此同心。不要志气高大、倒要俯就卑微的人。〔人或作事〕不要自以为聪明。  
12:17 不要以恶报恶、众人以为美的事、要留心去作。  
12:18 若是能行、总要尽力与众人和睦。  
12:19 亲爱的弟兄、不要自己伸冤、宁可让步、听凭主怒。〔或作让人发怒〕因为经上记着、『主说、伸冤在我。我必报应。』  
12:20 所以『你的仇敌若饿了、就给他吃。若渴了、就给他喝。因为你这样行、就是把炭火堆在他的头上。』  

12:21 你不可为恶所胜、反要以善胜恶。
