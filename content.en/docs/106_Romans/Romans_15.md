15:1 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.  
15:2 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.  
15:3 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.  
15:4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.  
15:5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:  

15:6 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
15:7 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.  
15:8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:  
15:9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.  
15:10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.  

15:11 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.  
15:12 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.  
15:13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.  
15:14 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.  
15:15 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,  

15:16 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.  
15:17 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.  
15:18 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,  
15:19 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.  
15:20 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:  

15:21 But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.  
15:22 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.  
15:23 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;  
15:24 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.  
15:25 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.  

15:26 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.  
15:27 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.  
15:28 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.  
15:29 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.  
15:30 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;  

15:31 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;  
15:32 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.  
15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

15:1 我们坚固的人、应该担代不坚固人的软弱、不求自己的喜悦。  
15:2 我们各人务要叫邻舍喜悦、使他得益处、建立德行。  
15:3 因为基督也不求自己的喜悦、如经上所记、『辱骂你人的辱骂、都落在我身上。』  
15:4 从前所写的圣经、都是为教训我们写的、叫我们因圣经所生的忍耐和安慰、可以得着盼望。  
15:5 但愿赐忍耐安慰的　神、叫你们彼此同心、效法基督耶稣。  

15:6 一心一口、荣耀　神、我们主耶稣基督的父。  
15:7 所以你们要彼此接纳、如同基督接纳你们一样、使荣耀归与　神。  
15:8 我说、基督是为　神真理作了受割礼人的执事、要证实所应许列祖的话。  
15:9 并叫外邦人、因他的怜悯、荣耀　神。如经上所记、『因此我要在外邦中称赞你、歌颂你的名。』  
15:10 又说、『你们外邦人、当与主的百姓一同欢乐。』  

15:11 又说、『外邦阿、你们当赞美主。万民哪、你们都当颂赞他。』  
15:12 又有以赛亚说、『将来有耶西的根、就是那兴起来要治理外邦的。外邦人要仰望他。』  
15:13 但愿使人有盼望的　神、因信、将诸般的喜乐平安、充满你们的心、使你们借着圣灵的能力、大有盼望。  
15:14 弟兄们、我自己也深信你们是满有良善、充足了诸般的知识、也能彼此劝戒。  
15:15 但我稍微放胆写信给你们、是要提醒你们的记性、特因　神所给我的恩典、  

15:16 使我为外邦人作基督耶稣的仆役、作　神福音的祭司、叫所献上的外邦人、因着圣灵、成为圣洁、可蒙悦纳。  
15:17 所以论到　神的事我在基督耶稣里有可夸的。  
15:18 除了基督借我作的那些事、我甚么都不敢提。只提他借我言语作为、用神迹奇事的能力、并圣灵的能力、使外邦人顺服。  
15:19 甚至我从耶路撒冷、直转到以利哩古、到处传了基督的福音。  
15:20 我立了志向、不在基督的名被称过的地方传福音、免得建造在别人的根基上。  

15:21 就如经上所记、『未曾闻知他信息的、将要看见。未曾听过的、将要明白。』  
15:22 我因多次被拦阻、总不得到你们那里去。  
15:23 但如今在这里再没有可传的地方、而且这好几年、我切心想望到士班雅去的时候、可以到你们那里。  
15:24 盼望从你们那里经过、得见你们、先与你们彼此交往、心里稍微满足、然后蒙你们送行。  
15:25 但现在我往耶路撒冷去、供给圣徒。  

15:26 因为马其顿、和亚该亚人乐意凑出捐项、给耶路撒冷圣徒中的穷人。  
15:27 这固然是他们乐意的。其实也算是所欠的债。因外邦人、既然在他们属灵的好处上有分、就当把养身之物供给他们。  
15:28 等我办完了这事、把这善果向他们交付明白、我就要路过你们那里、往士班雅去。  
15:29 我也晓得去的时候、必带着基督丰盛的恩典而去。  
15:30 弟兄们、我借着我们主耶稣基督、又借着圣灵的爱、劝你们与我一同竭力、为我祈求　神<label for="求" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">
祷告不是一件小事。它的本质是祷一场伟大的战事一场要取得胜利的战斗，一场要参与的伟大战役。祷告的基督徒，就像战士一样，在进行一场生死攸关的争战。
<br>得胜的祷告，是藉着得胜的驱逐撒但。- P. E. Billheimer
<br>2023年11月15日活泉小简</span>。  

15:31 叫我脱离在犹太不顺从的人、也叫我为耶路撒冷所办的捐项、可蒙圣徒悦纳。  
15:32 并叫我顺着　神的旨意、欢欢喜喜的到你们那里、与你们同得安息。  
15:33 愿赐平安的　神、常和你们众人同在。阿们。
