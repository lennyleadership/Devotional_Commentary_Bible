16:1 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:  
16:2 That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.  
16:3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:  
16:4 Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.  
16:5 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.  

16:6 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.  
16:7 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.  
16:8 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.  
16:9 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.  
16:10 Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household.  

16:11 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.  
16:12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.  
16:13 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.  
16:14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.  
16:15 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.  

16:16 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.  
16:17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.  
16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.  
16:19 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.  
16:20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.  

16:21 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.  
16:22 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.  
16:23 Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.  
16:24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.  
16:25 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,  

16:26 But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:  
16:27 To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.

16:1 我对你们举荐我们的姊妹非比、他是坚革哩教会中的女执事。  
16:2 请你们为主接待他、合乎圣徒的体统。他在何事上、要你们帮助、你们就帮助他。因他素来帮助许多人、也帮助了我。  
16:3 问百基拉和亚居拉安。他们在基督耶稣里与我同工、  
16:4 也为我的命、将自己的颈项、置之度外。不但我感谢他们、就是外邦的众教会、也感谢他们。  
16:5 又问在他们家中的教会安。问我所亲爱的以拜尼土安。他在亚西亚是归基督初结的果子。  

16:6 又问马利亚安。他为你们多受劳苦。  
16:7 又问我亲属与我一同坐监的安多尼古和犹尼亚安。他们在使徒中是有名望的、也是比我先在基督里。  
16:8 又问我在主里面所亲爱的暗伯利安。  
16:9 又问在基督里与我们同工的耳巴奴、并我所亲爱的士大古安。  
16:10 又问在基督里经过试验的亚比利安。问亚利多布家里的人安。  

16:11 又问我亲属希罗天安。问拿其数家在主里的人安。  
16:12 又问为主劳苦的土非拿氏和土富撒氏安。问可亲爱为主多受劳苦的彼息氏安。  
16:13 又问在主蒙拣选的鲁孚和他母亲安。他的母亲就是我的母亲。  
16:14 又问亚逊其土、弗勒干、黑米、八罗巴、黑马、并与他们在一处的弟兄们安。  
16:15 又问非罗罗古、和犹利亚、尼利亚、和他姊妹、同阿林巴、并与他们在一处的众圣徒安。  

16:16 你们亲嘴问安、彼此务要圣洁。基督的众教会都问你们安。  
16:17 弟兄们、那些离间你们、叫你们跌倒、背乎所学之道的人、我劝你们要留意躲避他们。  
16:18 因为这样的人不服事我们的主基督、只服事自己的肚腹。用花言巧语、诱惑那些老实人的心。  
16:19 你们的顺服、已经传于众人、所以我为你们欢喜。但我愿意你们在善上聪明、在恶上愚拙。  
16:20 赐平安的　神、快要将撒但践踏在你们脚下。愿我主耶稣基督的恩、常和你们同在。  

16:21 与我同工的提摩太、和我的亲属路求、耶孙、所西巴德、问你们安。  
16:22 我这代笔写信的德丢、在主里面问你们安。  
16:23 那接待我、也接待全教会的该犹、问你们安。  
16:24 城内管银库的以拉都、和兄弟括土、问你们安。  
16:25 惟有　神能照我所传的福音、和所讲的耶稣基督、并照永古隐藏不言的奥秘、坚固你们的心。  

16:26 这奥秘如今显明出来、而且按着永生　神的命、借众先知的书指示万国的民、使他们信服真道。  
16:27 愿荣耀因耶稣基督归与独一全智的　神、直到永远。阿们。

A few days before the trip’s end, the Lord directed me to Romans 16:12 

>“Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord.  
> Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.”

It struck me – it does not say that they “laboured much <u class = "red">for</u> the the Lord” but that they “laboured <u class ="red">in</u> the Lord”. And is it not a blessing, as my devotional reading went on to say, that the Master knew that they did so in Him – and yes for Him. Isn’t it enough that He knows!
