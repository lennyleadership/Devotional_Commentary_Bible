10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.  
10:2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.  
10:3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.  
10:4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.  
10:5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.  

10:6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)  
10:7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)  
10:8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;  
10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  
10:10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  

10:11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  
10:12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.  
10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  
10:14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?  
10:15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

10:16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?  
10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  
10:18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.  
10:19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.  
10:20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.  

10:21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

10:1 弟兄们、我心里所愿的、向　神所求的、是要以色列人得救。  
10:2 我可以证明他们向　神有热心、但不是按着真知识。  
10:3 因为不知道　神的义、想要立自己的义、就不服　神的义了。  
10:4 律法的总结就是基督、使凡信他的都得着义。  
10:5 摩西写着说、『人若行那出于律法的义、就必因此活着。』  

10:6 惟有出于信心的义如此说、『你不要心里说、谁要升到天上去呢。就是要领下基督来。  
10:7 谁要下到阴间去呢。就是要领基督从死里上来。』  
10:8 他到底怎么说呢。他说、『这道离你不远、正在你口里、在你心里。』就是我们所传信主的道。  
10:9 你若口里认耶稣为主、心里信　神叫他从死里复活、就必得救。  
10:10 因为人心里相信、就可以称义。口里承认、就可以得救。  

10:11 经上说、『凡信他的人、必不至于羞愧。』  
10:12 犹太人和希利尼人、并没有分别。因为众人同有一位主、他也厚待一切求告他的人。  
10:13 因为『凡求告主名的、就必得救。』  
10:14 然而人未曾信他、怎能求他呢。未曾听见他、怎能信他呢。没有传道的、怎能听见呢。  
10:15 若没有奉差遣、怎能传道呢。如经上所记、『报福音传喜信的人、他们的脚踪何等佳美。』  

10:16 只是人没有都听从福音。因为以赛亚说、『主阿、我们所传的有谁信呢。』  
10:17 可见信道是从听道来的、听道是从基督的话来的。  
10:18 但我说、人没有听见么。诚然听见了。『他们的声音传遍天下、他们的言语传到地极。』  
10:19 我再说、以色列人不知道么。先有摩西说、『我要用那不成子民的、惹动你们的愤恨。我要用那无知的民、触动你们的怒气。』  
10:20 又有以赛亚放胆说、『没有寻找我的、我叫他们遇见。没有访问我的、我向他们显现。』  

10:21 至于以色列人、他说、『我整天伸手招呼那悖逆顶嘴的百姓。』
