11:1 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.  
11:2 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,  
11:3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.  
11:4 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.  
11:5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  

11:6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.  
11:7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.  
11:8 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.  
11:9 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:  
11:10 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.  

11:11 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.  
11:12 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?  
11:13 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:  
11:14 If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.  
11:15 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  

11:16 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.  
11:17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;  
11:18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.  
11:19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.  
11:20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:  

11:21 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.  
11:22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.    
11:23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">"Once saved, always saved."<br>The genuine salvation at the first place will be saved at the end.  Some believers went astray and yet returned can be saved.  However those who do not continue in his goodness were not saved truly at the first place.</span>.  
11:24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?  
11:25 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.  

11:26 And so all Israel shall be saved<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">repeat verse 1, God did not reject the nation of Israel.</span>: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:  
11:27 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.  
11:28 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.  
11:29 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">NLT: For God's gifts and his call can never be withdrawn.</span>.  
11:30 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:  

11:31 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.  
11:32 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.  
11:33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
11:34 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?  
11:35 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?  

11:36 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

11:1 我且说、　神弃绝了他的百姓么。断乎没有。因为我也是以色列人、亚伯拉罕的后裔、属便雅悯支派的。  
11:2 　神并没有弃绝他预先所知道的百姓。你们岂不晓得经上论到以利亚是怎么说的呢。他在　神面前怎样控告以色列人、说、  
11:3 『主阿、他们杀了你的先知、拆了你的祭坛、只剩下我一个人、他们还要寻索我的命。』  
11:4 　神的回话是怎么说的呢。他说、『我为自己留下七千人、是未曾向巴力屈膝的。』  
11:5 如今也是这样、照着拣选的恩典还有所留的余数。  

11:6 既是出于恩典、就不在乎行为。不然、恩典就不是恩典了。  
11:7 这是怎么样呢。以色列人所求的、他们没有得着。惟有蒙拣选的人得着了、其余的就成了顽梗不化的。  
11:8 如经上所记、『　神给他们昏迷的心、眼睛不能看见、耳朵不能听见、直到今日。』  
11:9 大卫也说、『愿他们的筵席变为网罗、变为机槛、变为绊脚石、作他们的报应。  
11:10 愿他们的眼睛昏蒙、不得看见。愿你时常弯下他们的腰。』  

11:11 我且说、他们失脚是要他们跌倒么。断乎不是。反倒因他们的过失、救恩便临到外邦人、要激动他们发愤。  
11:12 若他们的过失、为天下的富足、他们的缺乏、为外邦人的富足。何况他们的丰满呢。  
11:13 我对你们外邦人说这话。因我是外邦人的使徒、所以敬重我的职分。〔敬重原文作荣耀〕  
11:14 或者可以激动我骨肉之亲发愤、好救他们一些人。  
11:15 若他们被丢弃、天下就得与　神和好、他们被收纳、岂不是死而复生么。  

11:16 所献的新面若是圣洁、全团也就圣洁了。树根若是圣洁、树枝也就圣洁了。  
11:17 若有几根枝子被折下来、你这野橄榄得接在其中、一同得着橄榄根的肥汁。  
11:18 你就不可向旧枝子夸口、若是夸口、当知道不是你托着根、乃是根托着你。  
11:19 你若说、那枝子被折下来、是特为叫我接上。  
11:20 不错。他们因为不信、所以被折下来。你因为信、所以立得住。你不可自高、反要惧怕。  

11:21 　神既不爱惜原来的枝子、也必不爱惜你。  
11:22 可见　神的恩慈、和严厉。向那跌倒的人、是严厉的。向你是有恩慈的。只要你长久在他的恩慈里。不然、你也要被砍下来。  
11:23 而且他们若不是长久不信、仍要被接上。因为　神能够把他们从新接上。  
11:24 你是从那天生的野橄榄上砍下来的、尚且逆着性得接在好橄榄上、何况这本树的枝子、要接在本树上呢。  
11:25 弟兄们、我不愿意你们不知道这奥秘、（恐怕你们自以为聪明)就是以色列人有几分是硬心的、等到外邦人的数目添满了。  

11:26 于是以色列全家都要得救、如经上所记、『必有一位救主、从锡安出来、要消除雅各家的一切罪恶。』  
11:27 又说、『我除去他们罪的时候、这就是我与他们所立的约。』  
11:28 就着福音说、他们为你们的缘故是仇敌。就着拣选说、他们为列祖的缘故是蒙爱的。  
11:29 因为　神的恩赐和选召、是没有后悔的。  
11:30 你们从前不顺服　神、如今因他们的不顺服、你们倒蒙了怜恤。  

11:31 这样、他们也是不顺服、叫他们因着施给你们的怜恤、现在也就蒙怜恤。  
11:32 因为　神将众人都圈在不顺服之中、特意要怜恤众人。  
11:33 深哉、　神丰富的智慧和知识。他的判断、何其难测、他的踪迹何其难寻、  
11:34 谁知道主的心、谁作过他的谋士呢、  
11:35 谁是先给了他、使他后来偿还呢。  

11:36 因为万有都是本于他、倚靠他、归于他。愿荣耀归给他、直到永远。阿们。
