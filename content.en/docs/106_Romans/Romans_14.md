14:1 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.  
14:2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.  
14:3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.  
14:4 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.  
14:5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.  

14:6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.  
14:7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.  
14:8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.  
14:9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.  
14:10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  

14:11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.  
14:12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.  
14:13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.  
14:14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.  
14:15 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.  

14:16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:  
14:17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  
14:18 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.  
14:19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.  
14:20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.  

14:21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.  
14:22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.  
14:23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

14:1 信心软弱的、你们要接纳、但不要辩论所疑惑的事。  
14:2 有人信百物都可吃。但那软弱的、只吃蔬菜。  
14:3 吃的人不可轻看不吃的人。不吃的人不可论断吃的人。因为　神已经收纳他了。  
14:4 你是谁、竟论断别人的仆人呢。他或站住、或跌倒、自有他的主人在。而且他也必要站住。因为主能使他站住。  
14:5 有人看这日比那日强、有人看日日都是一样。只是各人心里要意见坚定。  

14:6 守日的人、是为主守的。吃的人、是为主吃的、因他感谢　神。不吃的人、是为主不吃的、也感谢　神。  
14:7 我们没有一个人为自己活、也没有一个人为自己死。  
14:8 我们若活着、是为主而活。若死了、是为主而死。所以我们或活或死、总是主的人。  
14:9 因此基督死了、又活了、为要作死人并活人的主。  
14:10 你这个人、为甚么论断弟兄呢。又为甚么轻看弟兄呢。因我们都要站在　神的台前。  

14:11 经上写着、『主说、我凭着我的永生起誓、万膝必向我跪拜、万口必向我承认。』  
14:12 这样看来、我们各人必要将自己的事、在　神面前说明。  
14:13 所以我们不可再彼此论断。宁可定意谁也不给弟兄放下绊脚跌人之物。  
14:14 我凭着主耶稣确知深信、凡物本来没有不洁净的。惟独人以为不洁净的、在他就不洁净了。  
14:15 你若因食物叫弟兄忧愁、就不是按着爱人的道理行。基督已经替他死、你不可因你的食物叫他败坏。  

14:16 不可叫你的善被人毁谤。  
14:17 因为　神的国、不在乎吃喝、只在乎公义、和平、并圣灵中的喜乐。  
14:18 在这几样上服事基督的、就为　神所喜悦、又为人所称许。  
14:19 所以我们务要追求和睦的事、与彼此建立德行的事。  
14:20 不可因食物毁坏　神的工程。凡物固然洁净、但有人因食物叫人跌倒、就是他的罪了。  

14:21 无论是吃肉、是喝酒、是甚么别的事、叫弟兄跌倒、一概不作才好。  
14:22 你有信心、就当在　神面前守着。人在自己以为可行的事上、能不自责、就有福了。  
14:23 若有疑心而吃的、就必有罪。因为他吃、不是出于信心。凡不出于信心的都是罪。
