7:1 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?  
7:2 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.  
7:3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.  
7:4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.  
7:5 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.  

7:6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.  
7:7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.  
7:8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.  
7:9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  
7:10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.  

<b>7:11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me</b>.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">NLT: Sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me; it used the commands to kill me.

7:12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  
7:13 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.  
7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.  
7:15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.  

7:16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.  
7:17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  
7:18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.  
7:19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.  
7:20 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  

7:21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.  
7:22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:  
7:23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.  
7:24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?  
7:25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

7:1 弟兄们、我现在对明白律法的人说、你们岂不晓得律法管人是在活着的时候么。  
7:2 就如女人有了丈夫、丈夫还活着、就被律法约束。丈夫若死了、就脱离了丈夫的律法。  
7:3 所以丈夫活着、他若归于别人、便叫淫妇。丈夫若死了、他就脱离了丈夫的律法、虽然归于别人、也不是淫妇。  
7:4 我的弟兄们、这样说来、你们借着基督的身体、在律法上也是死了。叫你们归于别人、就是归于那从死里复活的、叫我们结果子给　神。  
7:5 因为我们属肉体的时候、那因律法而生的恶欲、就在我们肢体中发动、以致结成死亡的果子。  

7:6 但我们既然在捆我们的律法上死了、现今就脱离了律法。叫我们服事主、要按着心灵的新样、不按着仪文的旧样。〔心灵或作圣灵〕  
7:7 这样、我们可说甚么呢。律法是罪么。断乎不是。只是非因律法、我就不知何为罪。非律法说、『不可起贪心。』我就不知何为贪心。  
7:8 然而罪趁着机会、就借着诫命叫诸般的贪心在我里头发动。因为没有律法罪是死的。  
7:9 我以前没有律法是活着的、但是诫命来到、罪又活了、我就死了。  
7:10 那本来叫人活的诫命、反倒叫我死。  

7:11 因为罪趁着机会、就借着诫命引诱我、并且杀了我。  
7:12 这样看来、律法是圣洁的、诫命也是圣洁、公义、良善的。  
7:13 既然如此、那良善的是叫我死么。断乎不是。叫我死的乃是罪。但罪借着那良善的叫我死、就显出真是罪。叫罪因着诫命更显出是恶极了。  
7:14 我们原晓得律法是属乎灵的、但我是属乎肉体的、是已经卖给罪了。  
7:15 因为我所作的、我自己不明白。我所愿意的、我并不作。我所恨恶的、我倒去作。  

7:16 若我所作的、是我所不愿意的、我就应承律法是善的。  
7:17 既是这样、就不是我作的、乃是住在我里头的罪作的。  
7:18 我也知道、在我里头、就是我肉体之中、没有良善。因为立志为善由得我、只是行出来由不得我。  
7:19 故此、我所愿意的善、我反不作。我所不愿意的恶、我倒去作。  
7:20 若我去作所不愿意作的、就不是我作的、乃是住在我里头的罪作的。  

7:21 我觉得有个律、就是我愿意为善的时候、便有恶与我同在。  
7:22 因为按着我里面的意思。〔原文作人〕我是喜欢　神的律。  
7:23 但我觉得肢体中另有个律、和我心中的律交战、把我掳去叫我附从那肢体中犯罪的律。  
7:24 我真是苦阿、谁能救我脱离这取死的身体呢。  
7:25 感谢　神、靠着我们的主耶稣基督就能脱离了。这样看来、我以内心顺服　神的律。我肉体却顺服罪的律了。
