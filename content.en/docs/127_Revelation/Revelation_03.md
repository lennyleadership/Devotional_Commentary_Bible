3:1 And unto the angel of <mark class = "lemon">the church in Sardis</mark> write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.  
3:2 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.  
3:3 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.  
3:4 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.  
3:5 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.  

3:6 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.  
3:7 And to the angel of <mark class = "lemon">the church in Philadelphia</mark> write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;  
3:8 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.  
3:9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.  
3:10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.  

3:11 Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.  
3:12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.  
3:13 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.  
3:14 And unto the angel of <mark class = "lemon">the church of the Laodiceans</mark> write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;  
3:15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.  

3:16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.  
3:17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:  
3:18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.  
3:19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.  
3:20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.  

3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.  
3:22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

3:1 你要写信给<mark class = "lemon">撒狄教会</mark>的使者、说、那有　神的七灵、和七星的、说、我知道你的行为、按名你是活的、其实是死的。  
3:2 你要儆醒、坚固那剩下将要衰微的。〔衰微原文作死〕因我见你的行为、在我　神面前、没有一样是完全的。  
3:3 所以要回想你是怎样领受、怎样听见的。又要遵守、并要悔改。若不儆醒、我必临到你那里如同贼一样。我几时临到、你也决不能知道。  
3:4 然而在撒狄你还有几名是未曾污秽自己衣服的。他们要穿白衣与我同行。因为他们是配得过的。  
3:5 凡得胜的、必这样穿白衣。我也必不从生命册上涂抹他的名。且要在我父面前、和我父众使者面前、认他的名。  

3:6 圣灵向众教会所说的话、凡有耳的、就应当听。  
3:7 你要写信给<mark class = "lemon">非拉铁非教会</mark>的使者、说、那圣洁、真实、拿着大卫的钥匙、开了就没有人能关、关了就没有人能开的、说、  
3:8 我知道你的行为、你略有一点力量、也曾遵守我的道、没有弃绝我的名。看哪、我在你面前给你一个敞开的门、是无人能关的。  
3:9 那撒但一会的、自称是犹太人、其实不是犹太人、乃是说谎话的、我要使他们来在你脚前下拜、也使他们知道我是已经爱你了。  
3:10 你既遵守我忍耐的道、我必在普天下人受试炼的时候、保守你免去你的试炼。  

3:11 我必快来、你要持守你所有的、免得人夺去你的冠冕。  
3:12 得胜的、我要叫他在我　神殿中作柱子、他也必不再从那里出去。我又要将我　神的名、和我　神城的名、（这城就是从天上从我　神那里降下来的新耶路撒冷)并我的新名、都写在他上面。  
3:13 圣灵向众教会所说的话、凡有耳的、就应当听。  
3:14 你要写信给<mark class = "lemon">老底嘉教会</mark>的使者、说、那为阿们的、为诚信真实见证的、在　神创造万物之上为元首的、说、  
3:15 我知道你的行为、你也不冷也不热。我巴不得你或冷或热。  

3:16 你既如温水、也不冷也不热、所以我必从我口中把你吐出去。  
3:17 你说、我是富足、已经发了财、一样都不缺。却不知道你是那困苦、可怜、贫穷、瞎眼、赤身的。  
3:18 我劝你向我买火炼的金子、叫你富足。又买白衣穿上、叫你赤身的羞耻不露出来。又买眼药擦你的眼睛、使你能看见。  
3:19 凡我所疼爱的、我就责备管教他。所以你要发热心、也要悔改。  
3:20 看哪、我站在门外叩门。若有听见我声音就开门的、我要进到他那里去、我与他、他与我一同坐席。  

3:21 得胜的、我要赐他在我宝座上与我同坐、就如我得了胜、在我父的宝座上与他同坐一般。  
3:22 圣灵向众教会所说的话、凡有耳的、就应当听。
