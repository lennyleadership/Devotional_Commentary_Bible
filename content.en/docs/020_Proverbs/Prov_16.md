16:1 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.  
16:2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.  
16:3 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.  
16:4 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.  
16:5 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.  

16:6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.  
16:7 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.  
16:8 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.  
16:9 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.  
16:10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.  

16:11 A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of the bag are his work.  
16:12 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.  
16:13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.  
16:14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.  
16:15 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.  

16:16 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!
16:17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.  
16:18 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.  
16:19 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.  
16:20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.  

16:21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.  
16:22 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.  
16:23 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.  
16:24 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.  
16:25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.  

16:26 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.  
16:27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.  
16:28 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.  
16:29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.  
16:30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.  

16:31 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.  
16:32 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. <a class = "marginnote">v32: Believers are resisting the evil nature.</a>   
16:33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.

16:25 有一条路、人以为正、至终成为死亡之路。  

16:26 劳力人的胃口、使他劳力、因为他的口腹催逼他。  
16:27 匪徒图谋奸恶、嘴上彷彿有烧焦的火。  
16:28 乖僻人播散分争。传舌的离间密友。  
16:29 强暴人诱惑邻舍、领他走不善之道。  
16:30 眼目紧合的、图谋乖僻、嘴唇紧闭的、成就邪恶。  

16:31 白发是荣耀的冠冕。在公义的道上、必能得着。  
16:32 不轻易发怒的、胜过勇士。治服己心的、强如取城。  
16:33 签放在怀里。定事由耶和华。
