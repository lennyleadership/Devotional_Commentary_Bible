21:1 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.<label for="king" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Psalm 2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, <b>against the LORD</b>, and against his anointed, saying, ... </span>  
21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.  
21:3 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.  
21:4 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.  
21:5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.  

21:6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.  
21:7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.  
21:8 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.  
21:9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.  
21:10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.  

21:11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.  
21:12 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.  
21:13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.  
21:14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.  
21:15 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.  

21:16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.  
21:17 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.  
21:18 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.  
21:19 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.  
21:20 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.  

21:21 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.  
21:22 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.  
21:23 Whoso <b>keepeth his mouth and his tongue</b> keepeth his soul from troubles.<label for="tongu" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Psalm 34:13 NKJV
Keep your tongue from evil, And your lips from speaking deceit.
</span>  
21:24 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.  
21:25 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.  

21:26 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.  
21:27 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?  
21:28 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.  
21:29 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.  
21:30 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.  

21:31 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD.

21:4 恶人发达、眼高心傲、这乃是罪。〔发达原文作灯〕
21:5 殷勤筹画的、足致丰裕。行事急躁的、都必缺乏。  

21:6 用诡诈之舌求财的、就是自己取死。所得之财、乃是吹来吹去的浮云。
