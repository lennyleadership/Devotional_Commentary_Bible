17:1 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.  
17:2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.  
17:3 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.  
17:4 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.  
17:5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.  

17:6 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.  
17:7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.  
17:8 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.  
17:9 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.  
17:10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.  

17:11 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.  
17:12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.  
17:13 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.  
17:14 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.  
17:15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.  

17:16 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?  
17:17 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.  
17:18 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.  
17:19 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.  
17:20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.  

17:21 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.  
17:22 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.  
17:23 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.  
17:24 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.  
17:25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.  

17:26 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.  
17:27 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.  
17:28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

17:1 设筵满屋、大家相争、不如有块干饼、大家相安。  
17:2 仆人办事聪明、必管辖贻羞之子、又在众子中、同分产业。  
17:3 鼎为炼银、炉为炼金。惟有耶和华熬炼人心。  
17:4 行恶的留心听奸诈之言。说谎的侧耳听邪恶之语。  
17:5 戏笑穷人的、是辱没造他的主。幸灾乐祸的、必不免受罚。  

17:6 子孙为老人的冠冕。父亲是儿女的荣耀。  
17:7 愚顽人说美言本不相宜、何况君王说谎话呢。  
17:8 贿赂在馈送的人眼中、看为宝玉、随处运动、都得顺利。  
17:9 遮掩人过的、寻求人爱。屡次挑错的、离间密友。  
17:10 一句责备话、深入聪明人的心、强如责打愚昧人一百下。  

17:11 恶人只寻背叛、所以必有严厉的使者、奉差攻击他。  
17:12 宁可遇见丢崽子的母熊、不可遇见正行愚妄的愚昧人。  
17:13 以恶报善的、祸患必不离他的家。  
17:14 分争的起头、如水放开。所以在争闹之先、必当止息争竞。  
17:15 定恶人为义的、定义人为恶的、这都为耶和华所憎恶。  

17:16 愚昧人既无聪明、为何手拿价银买智慧呢。  
17:17 朋友乃时常亲爱。弟兄为患难而生。  
17:18 在邻舍面前击掌作保、乃是无知的人。  
17:19 喜爱争竞的、是喜爱过犯。高立家门的、乃自取败坏。  
17:20 心存邪僻的、寻不着好处。舌弄是非的、陷在祸患中。  

17:21 生愚昧子的、必自愁苦。愚顽人的父、毫无喜乐。  
17:22 喜乐的心、乃是良药。忧伤的灵、使骨枯干。  
17:23 恶人暗中受贿赂、为要颠倒判断。  
17:24 明哲人眼前有智慧。愚昧人眼望地极。  
17:25 愚昧子使父亲愁烦、使母亲忧苦。  

17:26 刑罚义人为不善。责打君子为不义。  
17:27 寡少言语的有知识。性情温良的有聪明。  
17:28 愚昧人若静默不言、也可算为智慧。闭口不说、也可算为聪明。
