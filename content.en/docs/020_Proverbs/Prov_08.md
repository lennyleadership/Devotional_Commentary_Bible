8:1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?  
8:2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.  
8:3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.  
8:4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.  
8:5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.  

8:6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.  
8:7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  
8:8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.  
8:9 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.  
8:10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.  

8:11 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.  
8:12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.  
8:13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.  
8:14 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.  
8:15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.  

8:16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.  
8:17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.  
8:18 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.  
8:19 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.  
8:20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:  

8:21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.  
8:22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.  
8:23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.  
8:24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.  
8:25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:  

8:26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.  
8:27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:  
8:28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:  
8:29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:  
8:30 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;  

8:31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.  
8:32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.  
8:33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.  
8:34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.  
8:35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.  

8:36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.

8:1 智慧岂不呼叫、聪明岂不发声。  
8:2 他在道旁高处的顶上、在十字路口站立。  
8:3 在城门旁、在城门口、在城门洞、大声说、  
8:4 众人哪、我呼叫你们。我向世人发声。  
8:5 说、愚蒙人哪、你们要会悟灵明。愚昧人哪、你们当心里明白。  

8:6 你们当听、因我要说极美的话。我张嘴要论正直的事。  
8:7 我的口要发出真理。我的嘴憎恶邪恶。  
8:8 我口中的言语、都是公义、并无弯曲乖僻。  
8:9 有聪明的以为明显、得知识的以为正直。  
8:10 你们当受我的教训、不受白银。宁得知识、胜过黄金。  

8:11 因为智慧比珍珠〔或作红宝石〕更美。一切可喜爱的、都不足与比较。  
8:12 我智慧以灵明为居所、又寻得知识和谋略。  
8:13 敬畏耶和华、在乎恨恶邪恶。那骄傲、狂妄、并恶道、以及乖谬的口、都为我所恨恶。  
8:14 我有谋略、和真知识。我乃聪明。我有能力。  
8:15 帝王借我坐国位。君王借我定公平。  

8:16 王子和首领、世上一切的审判官、都是借我掌权。  
8:17 爱我的、我也爱他。恳切寻求我的、必寻得见。  
8:18 丰富尊荣在我。恒久的财并公义也在我。  
8:19 我的果实胜过黄金。强如精金。我的出产超乎高银。  
8:20 我在公义的道上走、在公平的路中行。  

8:21 使爱我的承受货财、并充满他们的府库。[^1]  
8:22 在耶和华造化的起头、在太初创造万物之先、就有了我。  
8:23 从亘古、从太初、未有世界以前、我已被立。  
8:24 没有深渊、没有大水的泉源、我已生出。  
8:25 大山未曾奠定、小山未有之先、我已生出。  

8:26 耶和华还没有创造大地、和田野、并世上的土质、我已生出。  
8:27 他立高天、我在那里。他在渊面的周围、画出圆圈、  
8:28 上使穹苍坚硬、下使渊源稳固、  
8:29 为沧海定出界限、使水不越过他的命令、立定大地的根基。  
8:30 那时、我在他那里为工师、日日为他所喜爱、常常在他面前踊跃、  

8:31 踊跃在他为人预备可住之地、也喜悦住在世人之间。  
8:32 众子阿、现在要听从我。因为谨守我道的、便为有福。  
8:33 要听教训、就得智慧、不可弃绝。  
8:34 听从我、日日在我门口仰望、在我门框旁边等候的、那人便为有福。  
8:35 因为寻得我的、就寻得生命、也必蒙耶和华的恩惠。  

8:36 得罪我的、却害了自己的性命。恨恶我的、都喜爱死亡。
