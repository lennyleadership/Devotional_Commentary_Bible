19:1 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.  
19:2 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.  
19:3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.  
19:4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.  
19:5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.  

19:6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.  
19:7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.  
19:8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.  
19:9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.  
19:10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.  

19:11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and <b>it is his glory to pass over a transgression</b><label for="transgression" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">[ESV] it is his glory to overlook an offense.</span>.  
19:12 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.  
19:13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.  
19:14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.  
19:15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.  

19:16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.  
19:17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.  
19:18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.  
19:19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.  
19:20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.  

19:21 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.  
19:22 The desire of a man is his kindness<label for="desire" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">[ESV] What is desired in a man is steadfast love</span>: and a poor man is better than a liar.  
19:23 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.  
19:24 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.  
19:25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.  

19:26 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.  
19:27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.  
19:28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.  
19:29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.

19:4 财物使朋友增多。但穷人朋友远离。  
19:5 作假见证的、必不免受罚。吐出谎言的、终不能逃脱。  

19:6 好施散的、有多人求他的恩情。爱送礼的、人都为他的朋友。

19:11 人有见识、就不轻易发怒。宽恕人的过失、便是自己的荣耀。  
19:12 王的忿怒、好像狮子吼叫。他的恩典、却如草上的甘露。  
19:13 愚昧的儿子、是父亲的祸患。妻子的争吵、如雨连连滴漏。  
19:14 房屋钱财、是祖宗所遗留的。惟有贤慧的妻、是耶和华所赐的。  
19:15 懒惰使人沉睡。懈怠的人、必受饥饿。  

19:16 谨守诫命的、保全生命。轻忽己路的、必致死亡。  
19:17 怜悯贫穷的、就是借给耶和华。他的善行、耶和华必偿还。  
19:18 趁有指望、管教你的儿子。你的心不可任他死亡。  
19:19 暴怒的人、必受刑罚。你若救他、必须再救。

19:21 人心多有计谋。惟有耶和华的筹算、才能立定。  
19:22 施行仁慈的、令人爱慕。穷人强如说谎言的。  
19:23 敬畏耶和华的、得着生命。他必恒久知足、不遭祸患。  
19:24 懒惰人放手在盘子里。就是向口撤回、他也不肯。  
19:25 鞭打亵慢人、愚蒙人必长见识。责备明哲人、他就明白知识。  

19:26 虐待父亲、撵出母亲的、是贻羞致辱之子。  
19:27 我儿、不可听了教训、而又偏离知识的言语。  
19:28 匪徒作见证戏笑公平。恶人的口吞下罪孽。  
19:29 刑罚是为亵慢人预备的。鞭打是为愚昧人的背预备的。
