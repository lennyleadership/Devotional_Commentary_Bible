12:1 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish.  
12:2 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.  
12:3 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.  
12:4 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.  
12:5 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.  

12:6 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.  
12:7 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.  
12:8 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.  
12:9 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.  
12:10 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.  

12:11 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.  
12:12 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.  
12:13 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.  
12:14 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.  
12:15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.  

12:16 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.  
12:17 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.  
12:18 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health.<a class = "marginnote">Living wisdom | horizontal relationship | speach</a>  
12:19 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.  
12:20 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.  

12:21 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.  
12:22 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.  
12:23 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.  
12:24 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.  
12:25 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.  

12:26 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.  
12:27 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.  
12:28 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death.

12:1 喜爱管教的、就是喜爱知识。恨恶责备的、却是畜类。  
12:2 善人必蒙耶和华的恩惠。设诡计的人、耶和华必定他的罪。  
12:3 人靠恶行不能坚立。义人的根必不动摇。  
12:4 才德的妇人、是丈夫的冠冕。贻羞的妇人、如同朽烂在他丈夫的骨中。  
12:5 义人的思念是公平。恶人的计谋是诡诈。  

12:6 恶人的言论、是埋伏流人的血。正直人的口、必拯救人。  
12:7 恶人倾覆、归于无有。义人的家、必站得住。  
12:8 人必按自己的智慧被称赞。心中乖谬的、必被藐视。  
12:9 被人轻贱、却有仆人、强如自尊、缺少食物。  
12:10 义人顾惜他牲畜的命。恶人的怜悯、也是残忍。  

12:11 耕种自己田地的、必得饱食。追随虚浮的、却是无知。  
12:12 恶人想得坏人的网罗。义人的根、得以结实。  
12:13 恶人嘴中的过错、是自己的网罗。但义人必脱离患难。  
12:14 人因口所结的果子、必饱得美福。人手所作的、必为自己的报应。  
12:15 愚妄人所行的、在自己眼中看为正直。惟智慧人、肯听人的劝教。  

12:16 愚妄人的恼怒、立时显露。通达人能忍辱藏羞。  
12:17 说出真话的、显明公义。作假见证的、显出诡诈。  
12:18 说话浮躁的、如刀刺人。智慧人的舌头、却为医人的良药。  
12:19 口吐真言、永远坚立。舌说谎话、只存片时。  
12:20 图谋恶事的、心存诡诈。劝人和睦的、便得喜乐。  

12:21 义人不遭灾害。恶人满受祸患。  
12:22 说谎言的嘴、为耶和华所憎恶。行事诚实的、为他所喜悦。  
12:23 通达人隐藏知识。愚昧人的心、彰显愚昧。  
12:24 殷勤人的手必掌权。懒惰的人必服苦。  
12:25 人心忧虑、屈而不伸。一句良言、使心欢乐。  

12:26 义人引导他的邻舍。恶人的道、叫人失迷。  
12:27 懒惰的人、不烤打猎所得的。殷勤的人、却得宝贵的财物。  
12:28 在公义的道上有生命。其路之中、并无死亡。
