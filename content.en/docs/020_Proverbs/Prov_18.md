18:1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.  
18:2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.  
18:3 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.  
18:4 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.  
18:5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.  

18:6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.  
18:7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.  
18:8 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.  
18:9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.  
18:10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.  

18:11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.  
18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.  
18:13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.  
18:14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?  
18:15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.  

18:16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.  
18:17 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.  
18:18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.  
18:19 <b>A brother offended is harder to be won</b> than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.  
18:20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with <b>the fruit of his mouth</b>; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.  

18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.  
18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.  
18:23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.  
18:24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

18:1 与众寡合的、独自寻求心愿、并恼恨一切真智慧。  
18:2 愚昧人不喜爱明哲、只喜爱显露心意。  
18:3 恶人来、藐视随来。羞耻到、辱骂同到。  
18:4 人口中的言语、如同深水。智慧的泉源、好像涌流的河水。  
18:5 瞻徇恶人的情面、偏断义人的案件、都为不善。  

18:6 愚昧人张嘴启争端、开口招鞭打。  
18:7 愚昧人的口、自取败坏。他的嘴、是他生命的网罗。  
18:8 传舌人的言语、如同美食、深入人的心腹。  
18:9 作工懈怠的、与浪费人为弟兄。  
18:10 耶和华的名、是坚固台。义人奔入、便得安稳。  

18:11 富足人的财物、是他的坚城、在他心想、犹如高墙。  
18:12 败坏之先、人心骄傲。尊荣以前、必有谦卑。  
18:13 未曾听完先回答的、便是他的愚昧、和羞辱。  
18:14 人有疾病、心能忍耐。心灵忧伤、谁能承当呢。  
18:15 聪明人的心得知识。智慧人的耳求知识。  

18:16 人的礼物、为他开路、引他到高位的人面前。  
18:17 先诉情由的、似乎有理。但邻舍来到、就察出实情。  
18:18 掣签能止息争竞、也能解散强胜的人。  
18:19 弟兄结怨、劝他和好、比取坚固城还难。这样的争竞、如同坚寨的门闩。  
18:20 人口中所结的果子、必充满肚腹。他嘴所出的、必使他饱足。  

18:21 生死在舌头的权下、喜爱他的、必吃他所结的果子。  
18:22 得着贤妻的、是得着好处、也是蒙了耶和华的恩惠。  
18:23 贫穷人说哀求的话。富足人用威吓的话回答。  
18:24 滥交朋友的、自取败坏。但有一朋友、比弟兄更亲密。
