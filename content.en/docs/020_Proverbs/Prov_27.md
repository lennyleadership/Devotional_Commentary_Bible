27:1 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.  
27:2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.  
27:3 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.  
27:4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?  
27:5 Open rebuke is better than secret love.  

27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.  
27:7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.  
27:8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.  
27:9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.  
27:10 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.  

27:11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.  
27:12 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.  
27:13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.  
27:14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.  
27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.  

27:16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.  
27:17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.  
27:18 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.  
27:19 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.  
27:20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.  

27:21 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.  
27:22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.  
27:23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The principle of sheparding the congregation.</span>  
27:24 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?  
27:25 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.  

27:26 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.  
27:27 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.

27:1 不要为明日自夸、因为一日要生何事、你尚且不能知道。  
27:2 要别人夸奖你、不可用口自夸。等外人称赞你、不可用嘴自称。  
27:3 石头重、沙土沉、愚妄人的恼怒、比这两样更重。  
27:4 忿怒为残忍、怒气为狂澜、惟有嫉妒、谁能敌得住呢。  
27:5 当面的责备、强如背地的爱情。  

27:6 朋友加的伤痕出于忠诚。仇敌连连亲嘴、却是多余。  
27:7 人吃饱了、厌恶蜂房的蜜。人饥饿了、一切苦物都觉甘甜。  
27:8 人离本处飘流、好像雀鸟离窝游飞。  
27:9 膏油与香料、使人心喜悦。朋友诚实的劝教、也是如此甘美。  
27:10 你的朋友、和父亲的朋友、你都不可离弃。你遭难的日子、不要上弟兄的家去。相近的邻舍、强如远方的弟兄。  

27:11 我儿、你要作智慧人、好叫我的心欢喜、使我可以回答那讥诮我的人。  
27:12 通达人见祸藏躲。愚蒙人前往受害。  
27:13 谁为生人作保、就拿谁的衣服。谁为外女作保、谁就承当。  
27:14 清晨起来、大声给朋友祝福的、就算是咒诅他。  
27:15 大雨之日连连滴漏、和争吵的妇人一样。  

27:16 想拦阻他的、便是拦阻风、也是右手抓油。  
27:17 铁磨铁、磨出刃来。朋友相感、〔原文作磨朋友的脸〕也是如此。  
27:18 看守无花果树的、必吃树上的果子。敬奉主人的、必得尊荣。  
27:19 水中照脸、彼此相符。人与人、心也相对。  
27:20 阴间和灭亡、永不满足。人的眼目、也是如此。  

27:21 鼎为炼银、炉为炼金、人的称赞也试炼人。  
27:22 你虽用杵、将愚妄人与打碎的麦子一同捣在臼中、他的愚妄还是离不了他。  
27:23 你要详细知道你羊群的景况。留心料理你的牛群。  
27:24 因为资财不能永有。冠冕岂能存到万代。  
27:25 干草割去、嫩草发现、山上的菜蔬、也被收敛。  

27:26 羊羔之毛、是为你作衣服。山羊是为作田地的价值。  
27:27 并有母山羊奶够你吃、也够你的家眷吃、且够养你的婢女。
