8:1 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.  
8:2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.  
8:3 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.  
8:4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.  
8:5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.  

8:6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.  
8:7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.  
8:8 And there was great joy in that city.  
8:9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:  
8:10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.  

8:11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.  
8:12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  
8:13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.  
8:14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:  
8:15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: <a class ="marginnote">verse 15: It was studied at the LBC on 2023.04.18 - Tuesday night, Chinese Bible study.</a>  

8:16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)  
8:17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.  
8:18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,  
8:19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.  
8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.  

8:21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.  
8:22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.  
8:23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.  
8:24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.  
8:25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.  

8:26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.  
8:27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,  
8:28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.  
8:29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.  
8:30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?  

8:31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.  
8:32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:  
8:33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.  
8:34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?  
8:35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.  

8:36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?  
8:37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  
8:38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.  
8:39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.  
8:40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

8:1 从这日起、耶路撒冷的教会、大遭逼迫。除了使徒以外、门徒都分散在犹太和撒玛利亚各处。  
8:2 有虔诚的人、把司提反埋葬了、为他捶胸大哭。  
8:3 扫罗却残害教会、进各人的家、拉着男女下在监里。  
8:4 那些分散的人、往各处去传道。  
8:5 腓利下撒玛利亚城去、宣讲基督。  

8:6 众人听见了、又看见腓利所行的神迹、就同心合意的听从他的话。  
8:7 因为有许多人被污鬼附着、那些鬼大声呼叫、从他们身上出来。还有许多瘫痪的、瘸腿的、都得了医治。  
8:8 在那城里、就大有欢喜。  
8:9 有一个人、名叫西门、向来在那城里行邪术、妄自尊大、使撒玛利亚的百姓惊奇。  
8:10 无论大小、都听从他、说、这人就是那称为　神的大能者。  

8:11 他们听从他、因他久用邪术、使他们惊奇。  
8:12 及至他们信了腓利所传　神国的福音、和耶稣基督的名、连男带女就受了洗。  
8:13 西门自己也信了。既受了洗、就常与腓利在一处。看见他所行的神迹和大异能、就甚惊奇。  
8:14 使徒在耶路撒冷、听见撒玛利亚人领受了　神的道、就打发彼得约翰往他们那里去。  
8:15 两个人到了、就为他们祷告、要叫他们受圣灵。  

8:16 因为圣灵还没有降在他们一个人身上。他们只奉主耶稣的名受了洗。  
8:17 于是使徒按手在他们头上、他们就受了圣灵。  
8:18 西门看见使徒按手、便有圣灵赐下。就拿钱给使徒、  
8:19 说、把这权柄也给我、叫我手按着谁、谁就可以受圣灵。  
8:20 彼得说、你的银子、和你一同灭亡吧。因你想　神的恩赐、是可以用钱买的。  

8:21 你在这道上、无分无关。因为在　神面前、你的心不正。  
8:22 你当懊悔你这罪恶、祈求主。或者你心里的意念可得赦免。  
8:23 我看出你正在苦胆之中、被罪恶捆绑。  
8:24 西门说、愿你们为我求主、叫你们所说的、没有一样临到我身上。  
8:25 使徒既证明主道、而且传讲、就回耶路撒冷去、一路在撒玛利亚好些村庄传扬福音。  

8:26 有主的一个使者对腓利说、起来、向南走、往那从耶路撒冷下迦萨的路上去。那路是旷野。  
8:27 腓利就起身去了。不料、有一个埃提阿伯〔即古实见以赛亚十八章一节〕人、是个有大权的太监、在埃提阿伯女王干大基的手下总管银库、他上耶路撒冷礼拜去了。  
8:28 现在回来、在车上坐着、念先知以赛亚的书。  
8:29 圣灵对腓利说、你去贴近那车走。  
8:30 腓利就跑到太监那里、听见他念先知以赛亚的书、便问他说、你所念的、你明白么。  

8:31 他说、没有人指教我、怎能明白呢。于是请腓利上车、与他同坐。  
8:32 他所念的那段经、说、『他像羊被牵到宰杀之地、又像羊羔在剪毛的人手下无声、他也是这样不开口。  
8:33 他卑微的时候、人不按公义审判他。〔原文作他的审判被夺去〕谁能述说他的世代、因为他的生命从地上夺去。』  
8:34 太监对腓利说、请问、先知说这话、是指着谁、是指着自己呢、是指着别人呢。  
8:35 腓利就开口从这经上起、对他传讲耶稣。  

8:36 二人正往前走、到了有水的地方。太监说、看哪、这里有水、我受洗有甚么妨碍呢。〔有古卷在此有
8:37 腓利说、你若是一心相信、就可以。他回答说我信耶稣基督是　神的儿子〕
8:38 于是吩咐车站住、腓利和太监二人同下水里去、腓利就给他施洗。  
8:39 从水里上来、主的灵把腓利提了去、太监也不再见他了、就欢欢喜喜的走路。  
8:40 后来有人在亚锁都遇见腓利、他走遍那地方、在各城宣传福音、直到该撒利亚。

verse 15 <br>The baptism of the holy Spirit: 
<br>Brother K. Y.: 
<br><br>This is one occasion in the early church where we believe that God wanted to show that all who believe in Christ will receive the Holy Spirit as is told us in the Epistles.  Irrespective of whether they are Jew or Samaritan as the early Jewish believers may doubt if the Samaritans can be part of the church. So when the apostles prayed and the Samaritan believers received the Holy Spirit it showed to everyone that all who are in Christ is part of the Church and have the Holy Spirit.   
<br>After this occasion we know that as the new testament epistles tell us, all believer are sealed with the Holy Spirit the moment they believe.   
<br>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. (Romans 8:9 KJV)  
<br>Believers today receive the Holy Spirit at the point they put their trust in Christ and confess him as Saviour and Lord. Baptism has nothing to do with receiving of the Holy Spirit.  Even though a believer may be baptised 2 year after believing and trusting the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour. The believer already is indwelled by the Holy Spirit at the point of believing 2 years ago. The moment a person believes in Christ the Holy Spirit comes and lives in Him.

<br>~~~<br>Brother L. L.:
<br>In history, Jews and Samaritans hated each other. Most Jews would not travel through Samaria.  They went by a longer route to avoid Samaria and any contact with Samaritans.  

It was the first step that God called Philip, a Jew, to preach Jesus in the city of Samaria.  As a result, the Samaritan believers got baptized in water (verse 12).    

It was the second step that God called Peter and John, Jews, to laid their hands upon Samaritans and pray for their receiving the holy Spirit.  

God orchestrated the baptism with the interactions between Philip, Peter, and John with Samaritans so that the relationship between Jews and Samaritans can be built up, and that both Jews and Samaritans can join in one body of God.  



<br>~~~<br>Believers' Bible commentary by W. MacDonald  

8:14-17 When news that Samaria had avidly received the word reached the apostles ... at Jerusalem, they sent Peter and John to them. By the time they arrived, the believers had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, but they had not received the Holy Spirit. Obviously acting in accordance with divine guidance, the apostles prayed that these believers might receive the Holy Spirit and laid their hands on them. As soon as this was done, they received the Holy Spirit.  
<br>This immediately raises the question, “Why the difference between the order of events here and on the day of Pentecost?” At Pentecost the Jewish people:  
<br>1. Repented.  
<br>2. Were baptized.  
<br>3. Received the Holy Spirit.  
<br>Here the Samaritans:  
<br>1. Believed.  
<br>2. Were baptized.  
<br>3. Had the apostles pray for them and lay their hands on them.  
<br>4. Received the Holy Spirit.  
<br>Of one thing we can be sure: they were all saved in the same way—by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the only Way of Salvation. However, during this transitional time, bridging Judaism and Christianity, God chose to act sovereignly in connection with various communities of believers. Jewish believers were asked to dissociate themselves from the nation of Israel by baptism before they received the Spirit. Now the Samaritans must have special prayer and the apostles' hands laid on them. But why?  
<br>Perhaps the best answer is that it was intended to give expression to the unity of the church, whether made up of Jews or Samaritans. There was a real danger that the church in Jerusalem might retain ideas of Jewish superiority, and that they might continue to have no dealings with their Samaritan brethren. To avoid the possibility of schism, or the thought of two churches (one Jewish and one Samaritan), God sent the apostles to lay their hands on the Samaritans. This expressed full fellowship with them as believers in the Lord Jesus. They were all members of one body, all one in Christ Jesus.

<br>~~~<br>John Darby's commentary
<br>Philip however went down to Samaria, and preached Christ to them, and wrought miracles. They all give heed to him and are even baptised. A man who until then had bewitched them with sorcery, so that they had said he was the great power of God, even he also submits to the power which eclipsed his false marvels, and convinced him so much the more of its reality as he was conscious of the falseness of his own. The apostles make no difficulty with regard to Samaria. The history of Jesus must have enlightened them in that respect. Moreover, the Samaritans were not Gentiles. Still it was a Hellenist who preached the gospel there.
<br>A new truth comes out here in connection with the regular process of the assembly — namely, that the apostles conferred the Holy Ghost by means of prayer and the laying on of hands: a very important fact in the history of God's dealings. Moreover Samaria was a conquest which all the energy of Judaism had never been able to make. It was a new and splendid triumph for the gospel. Spiritual energy to subdue the world appertained to the assembly. Jerusalem was set aside: its day was over in that respect.

<br>~~~<br>Matthew Henry's commentary
<br>How they advanced and improved those of them that were sincere. It is said (Acts 8:16), The Holy Ghost was as yet fallen upon none of them, in those extraordinary powers which were conveyed by the descent of the Spirit upon the day of pentecost. They were none of them endued with the gift of tongues, which seems then to have been the most usual immediate effect of the pouring out of the Spirit. See Acts 10:45, Acts 10:46. This was both an eminent sign to those that believed not, and of excellent service to those that did. This, and other such gifts, they had not, only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, and so engaged in him and interested in him, which was necessary to salvation, and in this they had joy and satisfaction (Acts 10:8), though they could not speak with tongues. Those that are indeed given up to Christ, and have experienced the sanctifying influences and operations of the Spirit of grace, have great reason to be thankful, and no reason to complain, though they have not those gifts that are for ornament, and would make them bright. But it is intended that they should go on to the perfection of the present dispensation, for the greater honour of the gospel. We have reason to think that Philip had received these gifts of the Holy Ghost himself, but had not a power to confer them; the apostles must come to do this; and they did it not upon all that were baptized, but upon some of them, and, it should seem, such as were designed for some office in the church, or at least to be eminent active members of it; and upon some of them one gift of the Holy Ghost, and upon others another. See 1 Co 12:4, 1 Co 12:8; 1 Co 14:26. <br>Now in order to this, 1. The apostles prayed for them, Acts 8:15. The Spirit is given, not to ourselves only (Luke 11:13), but to others also, in answer to prayer: I will put my Spirit within you (Eze 36:27), but I will for this be enquired of, Acts 8:37. We may take encouragement from this example in praying to God to give the renewing graces of the Holy Ghost to those whose spiritual welfare we are concerned for - for our children, for our friends, for our ministers. We should pray, and pray earnestly, that they may receive the Holy Ghost; for this includes all blessings. <br>2. They laid their hands on them, to signify that their prayers were answered, and that the gift of the Holy Ghost was conferred upon them; for, upon the use of this sign, they received the Holy Ghost, and spoke with tongues. The laying on of hands was anciently used in blessing, by those who blessed with authority. Thus the apostles blessed these new converts, ordained some to be ministers, and confirmed others in their Christianity. We cannot now, nor can any, thus give the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands; but this may intimate to us that those whom we pray for we should use our endeavours with.
