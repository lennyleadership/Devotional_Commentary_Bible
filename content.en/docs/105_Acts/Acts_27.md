27:1 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.  
27:2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.  
27:3 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.  
27:4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.  
27:5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.  

27:6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.  
27:7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;  
27:8 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.  
27:9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,  
27:10 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.  

27:11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.  
27:12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.  
27:13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.  
27:14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.  
27:15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.  

27:16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:  
27:17 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.  
27:18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;  
27:19 And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.  
27:20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.  

27:21 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.  
27:22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.  
27:23 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,  
27:24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.  
27:25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.  

27:26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.  
27:27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;  
27:28 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.  
27:29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.  
27:30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,  

27:31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.  
27:32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.  
27:33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.  
27:34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.  
27:35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.  

27:36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.  
27:37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.  
27:38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.  
27:39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.  
27:40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.  

27:41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.  
27:42 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.  
27:43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:  
27:44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.

27:1 非斯都既然定规了、叫我们坐船往义大利去、便将保罗、和别的囚犯、交给御营里的一个百夫长、名叫犹流。  
27:2 有一只亚大米田的船、要沿着亚西亚一带地方的海边走、我们就上了那船开行、有马其顿的帖撒罗尼迦人、亚里达古、和我们同去。  
27:3 第二天、到了西顿。犹流宽待保罗、准他往朋友那里去、受他们的照应。  
27:4 从那里又开船、因为风不顺、就贴着居比路背风岸行去。  
27:5 过了基利家旁非利亚前面的海、就到了吕家的每拉。  

27:6 在那里百夫长遇见一只亚力山太的船、要往义大利去、便叫我们上了那船。  
27:7 一连多日、船行得慢、仅仅来到革尼土的对面。因为被风拦阻、就贴着革哩底背风岸、从撒摩尼对面行过。  
27:8 我们沿岸行走、仅仅来到一个地方、名叫佳澳。离那里不远、有拉西亚城。  
27:9 走的日子多了、已经过了禁食的节期、行船又危险、保罗就劝众人说、  
27:10 众位、我看这次行船、不但货物和船要受伤损、大遭破坏、连我们的性命也难保。  

27:11 但百夫长信从掌船的和船主、不信从保罗所说的。  
27:12 且因在这海口过冬不便、船上的人、就多半说、不如开船离开这地方、或者能到非尼基过冬。非尼基是革哩底的一个海口、一面朝东北、一面朝东南。  
27:13 这时微微起了南风、他们以为得意、就起了锚、贴近革哩底行去。  
27:14 不多几时、狂风从岛上扑下来、那风名叫友拉革罗。  
27:15 船被风抓住、敌不住风、我们就任风刮去。  

27:16 贴着一个小岛的背风岸奔行、那岛名叫高大、在那里仅仅收住了小船。  
27:17 既然把小船拉上来、就用缆索捆绑船底。又恐怕在赛耳底沙滩上搁了浅、就落下篷来、任船飘去。  
27:18 我们被风浪逼得甚急、第二天众人就把货物抛在海里。  
27:19 到第三天、他们又亲手把船上的器具抛弃了。  
27:20 太阳和星辰多日不显露、又有狂风大浪催逼、我们得救的指望就都绝了。  

27:21 众人多日没有吃甚么、保罗就出来站在他们中间说、众位、你们本该听我的话、不离开革哩底、免得遭这样的伤损破坏。  
27:22 现在我还劝你们放心。你们的性命、一个也不失丧、惟独失丧这船。  
27:23 因我所属所事奉的　神、他的使者昨夜站在我旁边说、  
27:24 保罗、不要害怕、你必定站在该撒面前。并且与你同船的人、　神都赐给你了。  
27:25 所以众位可以放心、我信　神他怎样对我说、事情也要怎样成就。  

27:26 只是我们必要撞在一个岛上。  
27:27 到了第十四天夜间、船在亚底亚海、飘来飘去、约到半夜、水手以为渐近旱地、  
27:28 就探深浅、探得有十二丈。稍往前行、又探深浅、探得有九丈。  
27:29 恐怕撞在石头上、就从船尾抛下四个锚、盼望天亮。  
27:30 水手想要逃出船去、把小船放在海里、假作要从船头抛锚的样子。  

27:31 保罗对百夫长和兵丁说、这些人若不等在船上、你们必不能得救。  
27:32 于是兵丁砍断小船的绳子、由他飘去。  
27:33 天渐亮的时候、保罗劝众人都吃饭、说、你们悬望忍饿不吃甚么、已经十四天了。  
27:34 所以我劝你们吃饭、这是关乎你们救命的事。因为你们各人连一根头发、也不至于损坏。  
27:35 保罗说了这话、就拿着饼、在众人面前祝谢了　神、擘开吃。  

27:36 于是他们都放下心、也就吃了。  
27:37 我们在船上的、共有二百七十六个人。  
27:38 他们吃饱了、就把船上的麦子、抛在海里、为要叫船轻一点。  
27:39 到了天亮、他们不认识那地方、但见一个海湾、有岸可登、就商议能把船拢进去不能。  
27:40 于是砍断缆索、弃锚在海里、同时也松开舵绳、拉起头篷、顺着风向岸行去。  

27:41 但遇着两水夹流的地方、就把船搁了浅。船头胶住不动、船尾被浪的猛力冲坏。  
27:42 兵丁的意思、要把囚犯杀了、恐怕有洑水脱逃的。  
27:43 但百夫长要救保罗、不准他们任意而行、就吩咐会洑水的、跳下水去先上岸。  
27:44 其余的人、可以用板子、或船上的零碎东西上岸。这样、众人都得了救上了岸。
