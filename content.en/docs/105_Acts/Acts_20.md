20:1 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.  
20:2 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,  
20:3 And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.  
20:4 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.  
20:5 These going before tarried for us at Troas.  

20:6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.  
20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.  
20:8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.  
20:9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.  
20:10 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.  

20:11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.  
20:12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.  
20:13 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.  
20:14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.  
20:15 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.  

20:16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.  
20:17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.  
20:18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,  
20:19 Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:  
20:20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,  

20:21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.  
20:22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:  
20:23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.  
20:24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.  
20:25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.  

20:26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.  
20:27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.  
20:28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.  
20:29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.  
20:30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.  

20:31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.  
20:32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.  
20:33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.  
20:34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.  
20:35 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.  

20:36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.  
20:37 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,  
20:38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.

20:1 乱定之后、保罗请门徒来、劝勉他们、就辞别起行、往马其顿去。  
20:2 走遍了那一带地方、用许多话劝勉门徒、〔或作众人〕然后来到希腊。  
20:3 在那里住了三个月、将要坐船往叙利亚去。犹太人设计要害他、他就定意从马其顿回去。  
20:4 同他到亚西亚去的、有庇哩亚人毕罗斯的儿子所巴特、帖撒罗尼迦人亚里达古、和西公都、还有特庇人该犹、并提摩太、又有亚西亚人推基古、和特罗非摩。  
20:5 这些人先走在特罗亚等候我们。  

20:6 过了除酵的日子、我们从腓立比开船、五天到了特罗亚、和他们相会、在那里住了七天。  
20:7 七日的第一日、我们聚会擘饼的时候、保罗因为要次日起行、就与他们讲论、直讲到半夜。  
20:8 我们聚会的那座楼上、有好些灯烛。  
20:9 有一个少年人、名叫犹推古、坐在窗台上、困倦沉睡。保罗讲了多时、少年人睡熟了、就从三层楼上掉下去。扶起他来、已经死了。  
20:10 保罗下去、伏在他身上、抱着他、说、你们不要发慌、他的灵魂还在身上。  

20:11 保罗又上去、擘饼、吃了、谈论许久、直到天亮、这才走了。  
20:12 有人把那童子活活的领来、得的安慰不小。  
20:13 我们先上船开往亚朔去、意思要在那里接保罗。因为他是这样安排的、他自己打算要步行。  
20:14 他既在亚朔与我们相会、我们就接他上船、来到米推利尼。  
20:15 从那里开船、次日到了基阿的对面。又次日、在撒摩靠岸。又次日、来到米利都。  

20:16 乃因保罗早已定意越过以弗所、免得在亚西亚耽延。他急忙前走、巴不得赶五旬节能到耶路撒冷。  
20:17 保罗从米利都打发人往以弗所去、请教会的长老来。  
20:18 他们来了、保罗就说、你们知道、自从我到亚西亚的日子以来、在你们中间始终为人如何、  
20:19 服事主凡事谦卑、眼中流泪、又因犹太人的谋害、经历试炼。  
20:20 你们也知道、凡与你们有益的、我没有一样避讳不说的。或在众人面前、或在各人家里、我都教导你们。  

20:21 又对犹太人、和希利尼人、证明当向　神悔改、信靠我主耶稣基督。  
20:22 现在我往耶路撒冷去、心甚迫切、〔原文作心被捆绑〕不知道在那里要遇见甚么事。  
20:23 但知道圣灵在各城里向我指证、说、有捆锁与患难等待我。  
20:24 我却不以性命为念、也不看为宝贵、只要行完我的路程、成就我从主耶稣所领受的职事、证明　神恩惠的福音。  
20:25 我素常在你们中间来往、传讲　神国的道、如今我晓得你们以后都不得再见我的面了。  

20:26 所以我今日向你们证明、你们中间无论何人死亡、罪不在我身上。〔原文作我于众人的血是洁净的〕
20:27 因为　神的旨意、我并没有一样避讳不传给你们的。  
20:28 圣灵立你们作全群的监督、你们就当为自己谨慎、也为全群谨慎、牧养　神的教会、就是他用自己血所买来的。〔或作救赎的〕
20:29 我知道我去之后、必有凶暴的豺狼、进入你们中间、不爱惜羊群。  
20:30 就是你们中间、也必有人起来、说悖谬的话、要引诱门徒跟从他们。  

20:31 所以你们应当儆醒、记念我三年之久、昼夜不住的流泪、劝戒你们各人。  
20:32 如今我把你们交托　神、和他恩惠的道。这道能建立你们、叫你们和一切成圣的人同得基业。  
20:33 我未曾贪图一个人的金、银、衣服。  
20:34 我这两只手、常供给我和同人的需用、这是你们自己知道的。  
20:35 我凡事给你们作榜样、叫你们知道、应当这样劳苦、扶助软弱的人、又当记念主耶稣的话、说、施比受更为有福。  

20:36 保罗说完了这话、就跪下同众人祷告。<label for="prayer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">祷告的时候屈膝跪下，这个姿势是一位恳切、谦卑的祈求者应有的姿势。在全能神的面前祷告，必须谦卑和诚恳。
<br><br>每当我走投无路，深觉自己的智慧和才干，都不足以帮助我度过难关时唯一能作的，就是屈膝祷告。-林肯
<br>2023年11月6日 活泉小简</span>  
20:37 众人痛哭、抱着保罗的颈项、和他亲嘴。  
20:38 叫他们最伤心的、就是他说、以后不能再见我的面那句话。于是送他上船去了。
