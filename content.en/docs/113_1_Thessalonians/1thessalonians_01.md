1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
1:2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;  
1:3 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;  
1:4 Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.  
1:5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.  

1:6 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:  
1:7 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.  
1:8 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.  
1:9 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;  
1:10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

1:1 保罗、西拉、提摩太、写信给帖撒罗尼迦在父　神和主耶稣基督里的教会。愿恩惠平安归与你们。  
1:2 我们为你们众人常常感谢　神、祷告的时候提到你们。  
1:3 在　神我们的父面前、不住的记念你们因信心所作的工夫、因爱心所受的劳苦、因盼望我们主耶稣基督所存的忍耐。  
1:4 被　神所爱的弟兄阿、我知道你们是蒙拣选的。  
1:5 因为我们的福音传到你们那里、不独在乎言语、也在乎权能、和圣灵、并充足的信心。正如你们知道我们在你们那里、为你们的缘故是怎样为人。  

1:6 并且你们在大难之中、蒙了圣灵所赐的喜乐、领受真道、就效法我们、也效法了主。  
1:7 甚至你们作了马其顿和亚该亚、所有信主之人的榜样。  
1:8 因为主的道从你们那里已经传扬出来、你们向　神的信心不但在马其顿和亚该亚、就是在各处、也都传开了。所以不用我们说甚么话。  
1:9 因为他们自己已经报明我们是怎样进到你们那里、你们是怎样离弃偶像归向　神、要服事那又真又活的　神、  
1:10 等候他儿子从天降临、就是他从死里复活的、那位救我们脱离将来忿怒的耶稣。
