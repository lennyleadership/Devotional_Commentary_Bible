2:1 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:  
2:2 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.  
2:3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:  
2:4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.  
2:5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:  

2:6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.  
2:7 But we were gentle among you, even as <b>a nurse</b> cherisheth her children:  
2:8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.  
2:9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.  
2:10 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:  

2:11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as <b>a father</b> doth his children,<label for="father" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The character of servant, the portrait of Jesus</span>    
2:12 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.  
2:13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.  
2:14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:  
2:15 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:  

2:16 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.  
2:17 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.  
2:18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.  
2:19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
2:20 For ye are our glory and joy.

2:1 弟兄们、你们自己原晓得我们进到你们那里、并不是徒然的。  
2:2 我们从前在腓立比被害受辱、这是你们知道的。然而还是靠我们的　神放开胆量、在大争战中把　神的福音传给你们。  
2:3 我们的劝勉、不是出于错误、不是出于污秽、也不是用诡诈。  
2:4 但　神既然验中了我们、把福音托付我们、我们就照样讲、不是要讨人喜欢、乃是要讨那察验我们心的　神喜欢。  
2:5 因为我们从来没有用过谄媚的话、这是你们知道的。也没有藏着贪心、这是　神可以作见证的。  

2:6 我们作基督的使徒、虽然可以叫人尊重、却没有向你们或向别人求荣耀、
2:7 只在你们中间存心温柔、如同母亲乳养自己的孩子。  
2:8 我们既是这样爱你们、不但愿意将　神的福音给你们、连自己的性命也愿意给你们、因你们是我们所疼爱的。  
2:9 弟兄们、你们记念我们的辛苦劳碌、昼夜作工、传　神的福音给你们、免得叫你们一人受累。  
2:10 我们向你们信主的人、是何等圣洁、公义、无可指摘、有你们作见证、也有　神作见证。  

2:11 你们也晓得我们怎样劝勉你们、安慰你们、嘱咐你们各人、好像父亲待自己的儿女一样。  
2:12 要叫你们行事对得起那召你们进他国得他荣耀的　神。  
2:13 为此、我们也不住的感谢　神、因你们听见我们所传　神的道、就领受了、不以为是人的道、乃以为是　神的道。这道实在是　神的、并且运行在你们信主的人心中。  
2:14 弟兄们、你们曾效法犹太中、在基督耶稣里　神的各教会。因为你们也受了本地人的苦害、像他们受了犹太人的苦害一样。  
2:15 这犹太人杀了主耶稣和先知、又把我们赶出去。他们不得　神的喜悦、且与众人为敌。  

2:16 不许我们传道给外邦人使外邦人得救、常常充满自己的罪恶。　神的忿怒临在他们身上已经到了极处。  
2:17 弟兄们、我们暂时与你们离别、是面目离别、心里却不离别、我们极力的想法子、很愿意见你们的面。  
2:18 所以我们有意到你们那里、我保罗有一两次要去、只是撒但阻挡了我们。  
2:19 我们的盼望和喜乐、并所夸的冠冕、是甚么呢。岂不是我们主耶稣来的时候你们在他面前站立得住么。  
2:20 因为你们就是我们的荣耀、我们的喜乐。
