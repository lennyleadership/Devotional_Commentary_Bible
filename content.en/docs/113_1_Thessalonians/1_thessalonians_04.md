4:1 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.  
4:2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.  
4:3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:  
4:4 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;  
4:5 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:  

4:6 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.  
4:7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.  
4:8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.  
4:9 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.  
4:10 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;  

4:11 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;  
4:12 That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.  
4:13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.  
4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.  
4:15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.  

4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:  
4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.  
4:18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

4:1 弟兄们、我还有话说。  我们靠着主耶稣求你们、劝你们、你们既然受了我们的教训、知道该怎样行、可以讨　神的喜悦、就要照你们现在所行的、更加勉励。  
4:2 你们原晓得我们凭主耶稣传给你们甚么命令。  
4:3 　神的旨意就是要你们成为圣洁、远避淫行。  
4:4 要你们各人晓得怎样用圣洁尊贵、守着自己的身体。  
4:5 不放纵私欲的邪情、像那不认识　神的外邦人。  

4:6 不要一个人在这事上越分、欺负他的弟兄。  因为这一类的事、主必报应、正如我预先对你们说过、又切切嘱咐你们的。  
4:7 　神召我们、本不是要我们沾染污秽、乃是要我们成为圣洁。  
4:8 所以那弃绝的、不是弃绝人、乃是弃绝那赐圣灵给你们的　神。  
4:9 论到弟兄们相爱、不用人写信给你们。  因为你们自己蒙了　神的教训、叫你们彼此相爱。  
4:10 你们向马其顿全地的众弟兄、固然是这样行、但我劝弟兄们要更加勉励。  

4:11 又要立志作安静人、办自己的事、亲手作工、正如我们从前所吩咐你们的。  
4:12 叫你们可以向外人行事端正、自己也就没有甚么缺乏了。  
4:13 论到睡了的人、我们不愿意弟兄们不知道、恐怕你们忧伤、像那些没有指望的人一样。  
4:14 我们若信耶稣死而复活了、那已经在耶稣里睡了的人、　神也必将他与耶稣一同带来。  
4:15 我们现在照主的话告诉你们一件事。  我们这活着还存留到主降临的人、断不能在那已经睡了的人之先。  

4:16 因为主必亲自从天降临、有呼叫的声音、和天使长的声音、又有　神的号吹响。  那在基督里死了的人必先复活。  
4:17 以后我们这活着还存留的人、必和他们一同被提到云里、在空中与主相遇。  这样、我们就要和主永远同在。  
4:18 所以你们当用这些话彼此劝慰。
