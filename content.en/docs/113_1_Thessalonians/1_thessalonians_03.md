3:1 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;  
3:2 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:  
3:3 That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.  
3:4 For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.  
3:5 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.  

3:6 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:  
3:7 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:  
3:8 For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.  
3:9 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;  
3:10 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

3:11 Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.  
3:12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:  
3:13 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

3:1 我们既不能再忍、就愿意独自等在雅典。  
3:2 打发我们的兄弟在基督福音上作　神执事的提摩太前去、〔作　神执事的有古卷作与　神同工的〕坚固你们、并在你们所信的道上劝慰你们。  
3:3 免得有人被诸般患难摇动。因为你们自己知道我们受患难原是命定的。  
3:4 我们在你们那里的时候、预先告诉你们、我们必受患难、以后果然应验了、你们也知道。  
3:5 为此、我既不能再忍、就打发人去、要晓得你们的信心如何、恐怕那诱惑人的到底诱惑了你们、叫我们的劳苦归于徒然。  

3:6 但提摩太刚才从你们那里回来、将你们信心和爱心的好消息报给我们、又说你们常常记念我们、切切的想见我们、如同我们想见你们一样。  
3:7 所以弟兄们、我们在一切困苦患难之中、因着你们的信心就得了安慰。  
3:8 你们若靠主站立得稳、我们就活了。  
3:9 我们在　神面前、因着你们甚是喜乐、为这一切喜乐、可用何等的感谢、为你们报答　神呢。  
3:10 我们昼夜切切的祈求、要见你们的面、补满你们信心的不足。  

3:11 愿　神我们的父、和我们的主耶稣、一直引领我们到你们那里去。  
3:12 又愿主叫你们彼此相爱的心、并爱众人的心、都能增长、充足、如同我们爱你们一样。  
3:13 好使你们、当我们主耶稣同他众圣徒来的时候、在我们父　神面前、心里坚固、成为圣洁、无可责备。
