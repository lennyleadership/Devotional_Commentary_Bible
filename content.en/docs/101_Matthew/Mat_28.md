28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.  
28:2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.  
28:3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:  
28:4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.  
28:5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.  

28:6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.  
28:7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.  
28:8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.  
28:9 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.  
28:10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.  

28:11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.  
28:12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,  
28:13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.  
28:14 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.  
28:15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.  

28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.  
28:17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.  
28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.  
28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:  
28:20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

28:1 安息日将尽、七日的头一日、天快亮的时候、抹大拉的马利亚、和那个马利亚、来看坟墓。  
28:2 忽然地大震动。因为有主的使者、从天上下来、把石头滚开、坐在上面。  
28:3 他的像貌如同闪电、衣服洁白如雪。  
28:4 看守的人、就因他吓得浑身乱战、甚至和死人一样。  
28:5 天使对妇女说、不要害怕、我知道你们是寻找那钉十字架的耶稣。  

28:6 他不在这里、照他所说的、已经复活了。你们来看安放主的地方。  
28:7 快去告诉他的门徒说、他从死里复活了。并且在你们以先往加利利去、在那里你们要见他。看哪。我已经告诉你们了。  
28:8 妇女们就急忙离开坟墓、又害怕、又大大的欢喜、跑去要报给他的门徒。  
28:9 忽然耶稣遇见他们、说、愿你们平安。他们就上前抱住他的脚拜他。  
28:10 耶稣对他们说、不要害怕、你们去告诉我的弟兄、叫他们往加利利去、在那里必见我。  

28:11 他们去的时候、看守的兵、有几个进城去、将所经历的事、都报给祭司长。  
28:12 祭司长和长老聚集商议、就拿许多银钱给兵丁说、  
28:13 你们要这样说、夜间我们睡觉的时候、他的门徒来把他偷去了。  
28:14 倘若这话被巡抚听见、有我们劝他、保你们无事。  
28:15 兵丁受了银钱、就照所嘱咐他们的去行。这话就传说在犹太人中间、直到今日。  

28:16 十一个门徒往加利利去、到了耶稣约定的山上。  
28:17 他们见了耶稣就拜他。然而还有人疑惑。  
28:18 耶稣进前来、对他们说、天上地下所有的权柄、都赐给我了。  
28:19 所以你们要去、使万民作我的门徒、奉父子圣灵的名、给他们施洗。〔或作给他们施洗归于父子圣灵的名〕
28:20 凡我所吩咐你们的、都教训他们遵守我就常与你们同在、直到世界的末了。
