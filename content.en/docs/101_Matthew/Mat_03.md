3:1 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,  
3:2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  
3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.  
3:4 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.  
3:5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,  

3:6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.  
3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?  
3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:  
3:9 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.  
3:10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  

3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:  
3:12 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.  
3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.  
3:14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?  
3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to <b>fulfil all righteousness</b>. Then he suffered him.  

3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:  
3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

3:1 那时、有施洗的约翰出来、在犹太的旷野传道、说、  
3:2 天国近了、你们应当悔改。  
3:3 这人就是先知以赛亚所说的、他说、『在旷野有人声喊着说、预备主的道、修直他的路。』  
3:4 这约翰身穿骆驼毛的衣服、腰束皮带、吃的是蝗虫野蜜。  
3:5 那时、耶路撒冷和犹太全地、并约但河一带地方的人、都出去到约翰那里。  

3:6 承认他们的罪、在约但河里受他的洗。  
3:7 约翰看见许多法利赛人和撒都该人、也来受洗、就对他们说、毒蛇的种类、谁指示你们逃避将来的忿怒呢。  
3:8 你们要结出果子来、与悔改的心相称。  
3:9 不要自己心里说、有亚伯拉罕为我们的祖宗。我告诉你们、　神能从这些石头中给亚伯拉罕兴起子孙来。  
3:10 现在斧子已经放在树根上、凡不结好果子的树、就砍下来、丢在火里。  

3:11 我是用水给你们施洗、叫你们悔改。但那在我以后来的、能力比我更大、我就是给他提鞋、也不配。他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。  
3:12 他手里拿着簸箕、要扬净他的场、把麦子收在仓里、把糠用不灭的火烧尽了。  
3:13 当下、耶稣从加利利来到约但河、见了约翰、要受他的洗。  
3:14 约翰想要拦住他、说、我当受你的洗、你反倒上我这里来么。  
3:15 耶稣回答说、你暂且许我。因为我们理当这样尽诸般的义。〔或作礼〕于是约翰许了他。  
3:16 耶稣受了洗、随即从水里上来。天忽然为他开了、他就看见　神的灵、彷彿鸽子降下、落在他身上。  

3:17 从天上有声音说、这是我的爱子、我所喜悦的。

First, it must be understood that baptism is an outward proclamation of an inward conversion. In other words, baptism is a ceremonial act undertaken after a person accepts Jesus Christ as his or her Lord and Savior. This is usually done in the presence of the church body as a public proclamation of one’s faith.

Concerning the origin of baptism, Christian theologians suggest that, although baptism was used by John the Baptist, baptism itself did not originate with Christians or, for that matter, with John. Jews practiced baptism as a traditional act of purification and the initiation of converts to Judaism long before the coming of the Messiah. The origins of baptism might be found in the book of Leviticus where the Levite priests were commanded to perform a symbolic cleansing in water before and after performing their priestly duties. Leviticus 16:4 tells us, “He is to put on the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body; he is to tie the linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are sacred garments; so he must bathe himself with water before he puts them on.” Scripture also states in Leviticus 16:23-24, "Then Aaron is to go into the Tent of Meeting and take off the linen garments he put on before he entered the Most Holy Place, and he is to leave them there. He shall bathe himself with water in a holy place and put on his regular garments. Then he shall come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and the burnt offering for the people, to make atonement for himself and for the people.”

Although the act described in these Old Testament passages was not specifically called “baptism,” it does highlight how important and holy ceremonial (and practical) cleansing is to God. John’s “baptism of repentance” (Luke 3:3; Acts 19:4) followed this paradigm of cleansing, although the final cleansing from sin is only available through Christ, and John’s baptism was the foreshadowing of that. The significance of baptism as a New Testament ceremony is that, as believers in Jesus Christ, we are baptized into His death (Romans 6:3) and raised to walk in newness of life (Romans 6:4 KJV). The Lord taught the significance of baptism to the extent that He Himself was baptized by John the Baptist at the start of His ministry (Mark 1:9).
