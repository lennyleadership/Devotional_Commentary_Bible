18:1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?  
18:2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,  
18:3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  
18:4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  
18:5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.  

18:6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.  
18:7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
18:8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.  
18:9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  
18:10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.  

18:11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.  
18:12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  
18:13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.  
18:14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.  
18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  

18:16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  
18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  
18:18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  
18:19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  
18:20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.  

18:21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?  
18:22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.  
18:23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.  
18:24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.  
18:25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.  

18:26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  
18:27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.  
18:28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.  
18:29 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  
18:30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.  

18:31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.  
18:32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:  
18:33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?  
18:34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.  
18:35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

18:1 当时、门徒进前来、问耶稣说、天国里谁是最大的。  
18:2 耶稣便叫一个小孩子来、使他站在他们当中、  
18:3 说、我实在告诉你们、你们若不回转、变成小孩子的样式、断不得进天国。  
18:4 所以凡自己谦卑像这小孩子的、他在天国里就是最大的。  
18:5 凡为我的名、接待一个像这小孩子的、就是接待我。  

18:6 凡使这信我的一个小子跌倒的、倒不如把大磨石拴在这人的颈项上、沉在深海里。[^1]  
18:7 这世界有祸了、因为将人绊倒。绊倒人的事是免不了的、但那绊倒人的有祸了。  
18:8 倘若你一只手、或是一只脚、叫你跌倒、就砍下来丢掉。你缺一只手、或是一只脚、进入永生、强如有两手两脚、被丢在永火里。  
18:9 倘若你一只眼叫你跌倒、就把他剜出来丢掉。你只有一只眼进入永生、强如有两只眼被丢在地狱的火里。  
18:10 你们要小心、不可轻看这小子里的一个。我告诉你们、他们的使者在天上、常见我天父的面。〔有古卷在此有〕

18:11 〔人子来为要拯救失丧的人〕
18:12 一个人若有一百只羊、一只走迷了路、你们的意思如何。他岂不撇下这九十九只、往山里去找那只迷路的羊么。  
18:13 若是找着了、我实在告诉你们、他为这一只羊欢喜、比为那没有迷路的九十九只欢喜还大呢。  
18:14 你们在天上的父、也是这样不愿意这小子里失丧一个。  
18:15 倘若你的弟兄得罪你、你就去趁着只有他和你在一处的时候、指出他的错来。他若听你、你便得了你的弟兄。  

18:16 他若不听、你就另外带一两个人同去、要凭两三个人的口作见证、句句都可定准。  
18:17 若是不听他们、就告诉教会。若是不听教会、就看他像外邦人和税吏一样。  
18:18 我实在告诉你们、凡你们在地上所捆绑的、在天上也要捆绑。凡你们在地上所释放的、在天上也要释放。  
18:19 我又告诉你们、若是你们中间有两个人在地上、同心合意的求甚么事、我在天上的父、必为他们成全。  
18:20 因为无论在那里、有两三个人奉我的名聚会、那里就有我在他们中间。[^2]  

18:21 那时彼得进前来、对耶稣说、主阿、我弟兄得罪我、我当饶恕他几次呢。到七次可以么。  
18:22 耶稣说、我对你说、不是到七次、乃是到七十个七次。  
18:23 天国好像一个王、要和他仆人算帐。  
18:24 才算的时候、有人带了一个欠一千万银子的来。  
18:25 因为他没有甚么偿还之物、主人吩咐把他和他妻子儿女、并一切所有的都卖了偿还。  

18:26 那仆人就俯伏拜他说、主阿、宽容我将来我都要还清。  
18:27 那仆人的主人、就动了慈心、把他释放了、并且免了他的债。  
18:28 那仆人出来、遇见他的一个同伴、欠他十两银子、便揪着他、掐住他的喉咙、说、你把所欠的还我。  
18:29 他的同伴就俯伏央求他、说、宽容我吧、将来我必还清。  
18:30 他不肯、竟去把他下在监里、等他还了所欠的债。  

18:31 众同伴看见他所作的事、就甚忧愁、去把这事都告诉了主人。  
18:32 于是主人叫了他来、对他说、你这恶奴才、你央求我、我就把你所欠的都免了。  
18:33 你不应当怜恤你的同伴、像我怜恤你么。  
18:34 主人就大怒、把他交给掌刑的、等他还清了所欠的债。  
18:35 你们各人、若不从心里饶恕你的弟兄、我天父也要这样待你们了。

[^1]: [2022.10.19 LBC]  
what does the little child represent?  
the believer who trusts the Lord. Simply faith, young believers. no question but take the Bible verses.  
[^2]: 关于教会的交流  
弟兄D: 其实两三个人奉主的名聚会主就在他们中间了。什么是教会呢？有几个同心合意的弟兄姐妹在一起，就可以是教会了。那么教会当然是要有敞开的门，既然有敞开的门，就愿意人进来，既然有人进来，也会有撒旦的攻击进来，我们是不是因此要关闭这个敞开的门？靠主恩典！  
弟兄L: 假如关闭这个敞开的门，这样的聚会就成了物以类聚式的俱乐部。因此，毋须赘言！ 
以色列人经历过出埃及，进迦南，灭国，回归。如今式微的教会当初也经历过复兴的。目前教会同样在经历“被拆毁”的过程，但上帝依然看顾像义人一样的教会。存留属祂的教会。这是群体的层面。  
个人的层面，大卫的一生给我一点启示。撒母耳预示他讲成为以色列的王。大卫哪怕经历不堪的生活遭遇，依然抱有作王的盼望，依然活出王的样式。不是作王之后才有王的样式。  
大卫成了地上王的样式的楷模。我们也有成为属天“君尊祭司”的预示和期待。只要我们心中有这样的盼望，我们在教会中遇到的撒旦的攻击也就成了塑造“祭司”的机会。  
这样说来，大卫的一生也是我们属主之人的一生的写照。我们走在大卫所走过的路上，经历他所经历的生活中。  
羔羊成了旧约中耶稣的预表；大卫成了旧约中我们的预表。  
弟兄D: 这原是百种里最小的，等到长起来，却比各样的菜都大，且成了树，天上的飞鸟来宿在它的枝上。”(马太福音 13:32 和合本)  
我知道你的居所，就是有撒但座位之处；当我忠心的见证人安提帕在你们中间、撒但所住的地方被杀之时，你还坚守我的名，没有弃绝我的道。(启示录 2:13 和合本)  
马太福音里面芥菜种的比喻讲的是天国，也就是教会，"在你的居所有撒但座位" 讲的也是教会。在地上有的教会里，不仅有撒旦攻击，而且有飞鸟在其中做窝。  
我们种花的人知道，如果不剪掉枝子的顶端，它就容易长高，而难长宽。拓展神国，什么意思呢？比较简单直白的理解就是追求人数的增长。有几个牧师不在意人数呢?   在人看来，这是业绩。但它是不是代表弟兄姐妹生命的成长？那才是教会的实际。如果我们任凭枝子生长而不加以修剪，甚至是推动枝子生长，拔苗助长，结果生命可能就只剩下一个外壳，徒具其表了。教会不是一架隆隆运转的机器，而是一个又一个的肢体，搭配在身体上。神在教会上的心意, 是盼望教会追求生命的实际呢，还是拓展壮大，成了一颗树？  
你们这小群，不要惧怕，因为你们的父乐意把国赐给你们。 (Book of Luke 12:32 和合本)  
感谢主。
