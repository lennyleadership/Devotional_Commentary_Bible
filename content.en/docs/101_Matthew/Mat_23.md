23:1 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,  
23:2 Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:  
23:3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.  
23:4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.  
23:5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,  

23:6 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,  
23:7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.  
23:8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.  
23:9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.  
23:10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.  

23:11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.  
23:12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.  
23:13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.  
23:14 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.  
23:15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.  

23:16 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
23:17 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?  
23:18 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.  
23:19 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?  
23:20 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.  

23:21 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.  
23:22 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.  
23:23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.  
23:24 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.  
23:25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.  

23:26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.  
23:27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.  
23:28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  
23:29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,  
23:30 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.  

23:31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.  
23:32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.  
23:33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?  
23:34 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:  
23:35 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.  

23:36 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.  
23:37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
23:38 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.  
23:39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

23:1 那时、耶稣对众人和门徒讲论、  
23:2 说、文士和法利赛人、坐在摩西的位上。  
23:3 凡他们所吩咐你们的、你们都要谨守、遵行。但不要效法他们的行为。因为他们能说不能行。  
23:4 他们把难担的重担、捆起来搁在人的肩上。但自己一个指头也不肯动。  
23:5 他们一切所作的事、都是要叫人看见。所以将佩戴的经文做宽了、衣裳的繸子做长了。  

23:6 喜爱筵席上的首座、会堂里的高位。  
23:7 又喜爱人在街市上问他安、称呼他拉比。〔拉比就是夫子〕
23:8 但你们不要受拉比的称呼。因为只有一位是你们的夫子。你们都是弟兄。  
23:9 也不要称呼地上的人为父。因为只有一位是你们的父、就是在天上的父。  
23:10 也不要受师尊的称呼。因为只有一位是你们的师尊、就是基督。  

23:11 你们中间谁为大、谁就要作你们的用人。  
23:12 凡自高的必降为卑、自卑的必升为高。  
23:13 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们正当人前、把天国的门关了。自己不进去、正要进去的人、你们也不容他们进去。〔有古卷在此有〕
23:14 〔你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了因为你们侵吞寡妇的家产假意作很长的祷告所以要受更重的刑罚〕
23:15 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们走遍洋海陆地、勾引一个人入教。既入了教、却使他作地狱之子、比你们还加倍。  

23:16 你们这瞎眼领路的有祸了。你们说、凡指着殿起誓的、这算不得甚么。只是凡指着殿中金子起誓的、他就该谨守。  
23:17 你们这无知瞎眼的人哪、甚么是大的、是金子呢、还是叫金子成圣的殿呢。  
23:18 你们又说、凡指着坛起誓的、这算不得甚么。只是凡指着坛上礼物起誓的、他就该谨守。  
23:19 你们这瞎眼的人哪、甚么是大的、是礼物呢、还是叫礼物成圣的坛呢。  
23:20 所以人指着坛起誓、就是指着坛和坛上一切所有的起誓。  

23:21 人指着殿起誓、就是指着殿和那住在殿里的起誓。  
23:22 人指着天起誓、就是指着　神的宝座和那坐在上面的起誓。  
23:23 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们将薄荷、茴香、芹菜、献上十分之一。那律法上更重的事、就是公义、怜悯、信实、反倒不行了。这更重的是你们当行的、那也是不可不行的。  
23:24 你们这瞎眼领路的、蠓虫你们就滤出来、骆驼你们倒吞下去。  
23:25 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们洗净杯盘的外面、里面却盛满了勒索和放荡。  

23:26 你这瞎眼的法利赛人、先洗净杯盘的里面、好叫外面也干净了。  
23:27 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们好像粉饰的坟墓、外面好看、里面却装满了死人的骨头、和一切的污秽。  
23:28 你们也是如此、在人前、外面显出公义来、里面却装满了假善和不法的事。  
23:29 你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们建造先知的坟、修饰义人的墓、说、  
23:30 若是我们在我们祖宗的时候、必不和他们同流先知的血。  

23:31 这就是你们自己证明、是杀害先知者的子孙了。  
23:32 你们去充满你们祖宗的恶贯吧。  
23:33 你们这些蛇类、毒蛇之种阿、怎能逃脱地狱的刑罚呢。  
23:34 所以我差遣先知和智慧人并文士、到你们这里来。有的你们要杀害、要钉十字架。有的你们要在会堂里鞭打、从这城追逼到那城。  
23:35 叫世上所流义人的血、都归到你们身上。从义人亚伯的血起、直到你们在殿和坛中间所杀的巴拉加的儿子撒迦利亚的血为止。  

23:36 我实在告诉你们、这一切的罪、都要归到这世代了。  
23:37 耶路撒冷阿、耶路撒冷阿、你常杀害先知、又用石头打死那奉差遣到你这里来的人。我多次愿意聚集你的儿女、好像母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下、只是你们不愿意。  
23:38 看哪、你们的家成为荒场、留给你们。  
23:39 我告诉你们、从今以后、你们不得再见我、直等到你们说、奉主名来的、是应当称颂的。
