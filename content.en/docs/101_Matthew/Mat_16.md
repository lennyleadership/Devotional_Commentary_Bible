16:1 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.  
16:2 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.  
16:3 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?  
16:4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.  
16:5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.  

16:6 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  
16:7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.  
16:8 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?  
16:9 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  
16:10 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  

16:11 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?  
16:12 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  
16:13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?  
16:14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.  
16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?  

16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.  
16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.  
16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
16:19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  
16:20 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.  

16:21 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.  
16:22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.  
16:23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.  
16:24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  
16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.  

16:26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  
16:27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.  
16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

16:1 法利赛人和撒都该人、来试探耶稣、请他从天上显个神迹给他们看。  
16:2 耶稣回答说、晚上天发红、你们就说、天必要晴。  
16:3 早晨天发红、又发黑、你们就说、今日必有风雨。你们知道分辨天上的气色、倒不能分辨这时候的神迹。  
16:4 一个邪恶淫乱的世代求神迹、除了约拿的神迹以外、再没有神迹给他看。耶稣就离开他们去了。  
16:5 门徒渡到那边去、忘了带饼。  

16:6 耶稣对他们说、你们要谨慎、防备法利赛人和撒都该人的酵。  
16:7 门徒彼此议论说、这是因为我们没有带饼吧。  
16:8 耶稣看出来、就说、你们这小信的人、为甚么因为没有饼彼此议论呢。  
16:9 你们还不明白么、不记得那五个饼、分给五千人、又收拾了多少篮子的零碎么。  
16:10 也不记得那七个饼、分给四千人、又收拾了多少筐子的零碎么。  

16:11 我对你们说、要防备法利赛人和撒都该人的酵、这话不是指着饼说的。你们怎么不明白呢。  
16:12 门徒这才晓得他说的、不是叫他们防备饼的酵、乃是防备法利赛人和撒都该人的教训。  
16:13 耶稣到了该撒利亚腓立比的境内、就问门徒说、人说我人子是谁。〔有古卷无我字〕
16:14 他们说、有人说是施洗的约翰。有人说是以利亚。又有人说是耶利米、或是先知里的一位。  
16:15 耶稣说、你们说我是谁。  

16:16 西门彼得回答说、你是基督、是永生　神的儿子。  
16:17 耶稣对他说、西门巴约拿、你是有福的。因为这不是属血肉的指示你的、乃是我在天上的父指示的。  
16:18 我还告诉你、你是彼得、我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上。阴间的权柄、不能胜过他。〔权柄原文作门〕
16:19 我要把天国的钥匙给你。凡你在地上所捆绑的、在天上也要捆绑。凡你在地上所释放的、在天上也要释放。  
16:20 当下、耶稣嘱咐门徒、不可对人说他是基督。  

16:21 从此耶稣才指示门徒、他必须上耶路撒冷去、受长老祭司长文士许多的苦、并且被杀、第三日复活。  
16:22 彼得就拉着他、劝他说、主阿、万不可如此、这事必不临到你身上。  
16:23 耶稣转过来、对彼得说、撒但退我后边去吧。你是绊我脚的。因为你不体贴　神的意思、只体贴人的意思。  
16:24 于是耶稣对门徒说、若有人要跟从我、就当舍己、背起他的十字架、来跟从我。  
16:25 因为凡要救自己生命的、〔生命或作灵魂下同〕必丧掉生命。凡为我丧掉生命的、必得着生命。  

16:26 人若赚得全世界、赔上自己的生命、有甚么益处呢。人还能拿甚么换生命呢。  
16:27 人子要在他父的荣耀里、同着众使者降临。那时候、他要照各人的行为报应各人。  
16:28 我实在告诉你们、站在这里的、有人在没尝死味以前、必看见人子降临在他的国里。
