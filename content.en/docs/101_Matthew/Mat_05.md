5:1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:  
5:2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,  
5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  
5:4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.  
5:5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.  

5:6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.  
5:7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.  
5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.  
5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.  
5:10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  

5:11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.  
5:12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.  
5:13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.  
5:14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  
5:15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  

5:16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.  
5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  
5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  
5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  
5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.  

5:21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:  
5:22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  
5:23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  
5:24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  
5:25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  

5:26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.  
5:27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:  
5:28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.  
5:29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  
5:30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  

5:31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:  
5:32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.  
5:33 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:  
5:34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:  
5:35 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.  

5:36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  
5:37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.  
5:38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  
5:39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  
5:40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.  

5:41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  
5:42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.  
5:43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  
5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  
5:45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  

5:46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?  
5:47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  
5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

5:1 耶稣看见这许多的人、就上了山、既已坐下、门徒到他跟前来。  
5:2 他就开口教训他们说、  
5:3 虚心的人有福了。因为天国是他们的。  
5:4 哀恸的人有福了。因为他们必得安慰。  
5:5 温柔的人有福了。因为他们必承受地土。  

5:6 饥渴慕义的人有福了。因为他们必得饱足。  
5:7 怜恤人的人有福了。因为他们必蒙怜恤。  
5:8 清心的人有福了。因为他们必得见　神。  
5:9 使人和睦的人有福了。因为他们必称为　神的儿子。  
5:10 为义受逼迫的人有福了。因为天国是他们的。  

5:11 人若因我辱骂你们、逼迫你们、捏造各样坏话毁谤你们、你们就有福了。  
5:12 应当欢喜快乐。因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的。在你们以前的先知、人也是这样逼迫他们。  
5:13 你们是世上的盐。盐若失了味、怎能叫他再咸呢。以后无用、不过丢在外面、被人践踏了。  
5:14 你们是世上的光。城造在山上、是不能隐藏的。  
5:15 人点灯、不放在斗底下、是放在灯台上、就照亮一家的人。  

5:16 你们的光也当这样照在人前、叫他们看见你们的好行为、便将荣耀归给你们在天上的父。  
5:17 莫想我来要废掉律法和先知。我来不是要废掉、乃是要成全。  
5:18 我实在告诉你们、就是到天地都废去了、律法的一点一画也不能废去、都要成全。  
5:19 所以无论何人废掉这诫命中最小的一条、又教训人这样作、他在天国要称为最小的。但无论何人遵行这诫命、又教训人遵行、他在天国要称为大的。  
5:20 我告诉你们、你们的义、若不胜于文士和法利赛人的义、断不能进天国。  

5:21 你们听见有吩咐古人的话、说、『不可杀人、』又说、『凡杀人的、难免受审判。』  
5:22 只是我告诉你们、凡向弟兄动怒的、难免受审判。〔有古卷在凡字下添无缘无故的五字〕凡骂弟兄是拉加的、难免公会的审断。凡骂弟兄是魔利的、难免地狱的火。  
5:23 所以你在祭坛上献礼物的时候、若想起弟兄向你怀怨、  
5:24 就把礼物留在坛前、先去同弟兄和好、然后来献礼物。  
5:25 你同告你的对头还在路上、就赶紧与他和息。恐怕他把你送给审判官、审判官交付衙役、你就下在监里了。  

5:26 我实在告诉你、若有一文钱没有还清、你断不能从那里出来。  
5:27 你们听见有话说、『不可奸淫。』  
5:28 只是我告诉你们、凡看见妇女就动淫念的、这人心里已经与他犯奸淫了。  
5:29 若是你的右眼叫你跌倒、就剜出来丢掉。宁可失去百体中的一体、不叫全身丢在地狱里。  
5:30 若是右手叫你跌倒、就砍下来丢掉。宁可失去百体中的一体、不叫全身下入地狱。  

5:31 又有话说、人若休妻、就当给他休书。  
5:32 只是我告诉你们、凡休妻的、若不是为淫乱的缘故、就是叫他作淫妇了。人若娶这被休的妇人、也是犯奸淫了。  
5:33 你们又听见有吩咐古人的话、说、『不可背誓、所起的誓、总要向主谨守。』  
5:34 只是我告诉你们、甚么誓都不可起、不可指着天起誓、因为天是　神的座位。  
5:35 不可指着地起誓、因为地是他的脚凳。也不可指着耶路撒冷起誓、因为耶路撒冷是大君的京城。  

5:36 又不可指着你的头起誓、因为你不能使一根头发变黑变白了。  
5:37 你们的话、是、就说是。不是、就说不是。若再多说、就是出于那恶者。〔或作是从恶里出来的〕
5:38 你们听见有话说、『以眼还眼、以牙还牙。』  
5:39 只是我告诉你们、不要与恶人作对。有人打你的右脸、连左脸也转过来由他打。  
5:40 有人想要告你、要拿你的里衣、连外衣也由他拿去。  

5:41 有人强逼你走一里路、你就同他走二里。  
5:42 有求你的、就给他。有向你借贷的、不可推辞。  
5:43 你们听见有话说、『当爱你的邻舍、恨你的仇敌。』  
5:44 只是我告诉你们、要爱你们的仇敌。为那逼迫你们的祷告。  
5:45 这样、就可以作你们天父的儿子。因为他叫日头照好人、也照歹人、降雨给义人、也给不义的人。  

5:46 你们若单爱那爱你们的人。有甚么赏赐呢。就是税吏不也是这样行么。  
5:47 你们若单请你弟兄的安、比人有甚么长处呢。就是外邦人不也是这样行么。  
5:48 所以你们要完全、像你们的天父完全一样。
