2:1 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.  
2:2 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?  
2:3 And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.  
2:4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.  
2:5 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.  

  
2:6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.  
2:7 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.  
2:8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.  
2:9 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.  
2:10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;

 
2:11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.

2:12 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,

2:13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.

2:14 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.<a id="1_ref" href = "#1">[1]</a>

2:15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:

  
2:16 To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?

2:17 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.


<p id="1">[1] The picture here is that of the
 “Roman Triumph,” the special tribute that Rome gave
 to their conquering generals. It was their equivalent of
 the American ticker-tape parade.
 If a commander in chief won a complete victory
 over the enemy on foreign soil, and if he killed at least
 five thousand enemy soldiers and gained new territory
 for the emperor, then that commander in chief was
 entitled to a Roman Triumph. The processional would
 include the commander riding in a golden chariot, sur
rounded by his officers. The parade would also include
 a display of the spoils of battle, as well as the captive
 enemy soldiers. The Roman priests would also be in
 the parade, carrying burning incense to pay tribute to
 the victorious army.
 The procession would follow a special route
 through the city and would end at the Circus
 Maximus, where the helpless captives would entertain
 the people by fighting wild beasts. It was a very special
 day in Rome when the citizens were treated to a full
scale Roman Triumph.
 How does this piece of history apply to the bur
dened believer today? Jesus Christ, our great
 Commander in chief, came to foreign soil (this earth)
 and completely defeated the enemy (Satan). Instead of
 killing five thousand persons, He gave life to more than
 five thousand persons—to three thousand plus at
 Pentecost and to another two thousand plus shortly
 after Pentecost (Acts 2:41; 4:4). Jesus Christ claimed
 the spoils of battle—lost souls who had been in
 bondage to sin and Satan (Luke 11:14–22; Eph. 4:8;
 Col. 2:15). What a splendid victory!
 The victorious general’s sons would walk behind
 their father’s chariot, sharing in his victory; and that is
 where believers are today—following in Christ’s tri
umph. We do not fight for victory; we fight from
 victory. Neither in Asia nor in Corinth did the situa
tion look like victory to Paul, but he believed
 God—and God turned defeat into victory. - Wiersbe Bible Commentary

2:1 我自己定了主意、再到你们那里去、必须大家没有忧愁。  
2:2 倘若我叫你们忧愁、除了我叫那忧愁的人以外、谁能叫我快乐呢。  
2:3 我曾把这事写给你们、恐怕我到的时候、应该叫我快乐的那些人、反倒叫我忧愁。  我也深信、你们众人都以我的快乐为自己的快乐。  
2:4 我先前心里难过痛苦、多多的流泪、写信给你们。  不是叫你们忧愁、乃是叫你们知道我格外的疼爱你们。  
2:5 若有叫人忧愁的、他不但叫我忧愁、也是叫你们众人有几分忧愁、我说几分、恐怕说得太重。  

2:6 这样的人、受了众人的责罚、也就够了。  
2:7 倒不如赦免他、安慰他、免得他忧愁太过、甚至沉沦了。  
2:8 所以我劝你们、要向他显出坚定不移的爱心来。  
2:9 为此我先前也写信给你们、要试验你们、看你们凡事顺从不顺从。  
2:10 你们赦免谁、我也赦免谁、我若有所赦免的、是在基督面前为你们赦免的。  

2:11 免得撒但趁着机会胜过我们。  因我们并非不晓得他的诡计。  
2:12 我从前为基督的福音到了特罗亚、主也给我开了门。  
2:13 那时因为没有遇见兄弟提多、我心里不安、便辞别那里的人往马其顿去了。  
2:14 感谢　神、常帅领我们在基督里夸胜、并借着我们在各处显扬那因认识基督而有的香气。  
2:15 因为我们在　神面前、无论在得救的人身上、或灭亡的人身上、都有基督馨香之气。  

2:16 在这等人、就作了死的香气叫他死。  在那等人、就作了活的香气叫他活。  这事谁能当得起呢。  
2:17 我们不像那许多人、为利混乱　神的道。  乃是由于诚实、由于　神、在　神面前凭着基督讲道。
