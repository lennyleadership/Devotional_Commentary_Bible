1:1 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:  
1:2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,  
1:3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:  
1:4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises<label for="promises" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">I want to make a correction to what I said in summary of the book 2 Peter in last Wednesday study [2023-09-06].  I said Peter repeated the word "promise(s)" in 1:4 and 3:9, and that it seems to be a theme running in this letter.  My further study showed that "promise(s)" in these two verses were translated from different Greek words with same root.
<br>
However Peter did repeat "promise(s)" in another verse, 3:13.  Moreover, this Greek word ONLY appears twice in the Bible.
<br>
I think this word in 1:4 and 3：13 could be interpreted as "God's will" rather than "God's action".
<br>
我需要更正我上周三查经时候说的总结性的话。我当时说彼得在1:4和3:9用了“应许”，这个“应许”贯穿这本书。后来查考了希腊原文，发现这个单词的原文不是一个希腊单词。
<br>
不过，彼得确实在他的这封信中重复使用过同样的希腊单词，那节经文是3:13。而且整本圣经只出现过两次。
<br>
1:4和3：13里的“应许”可以理解为上帝的旨意，而不是将要发生的事情。
<br><br>
More interestingly, Paul expressed such promise earlier in his letter to believers in Thessalon, which is 1Thessalonians 4:3. "For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality;"
<br>
If we connect dots in letters in the Bible, we now understand 2Peter 3:15 means.
<br>
有意思的是保罗在写给帖撒罗尼迦教会的书信里提到同样的观点，在帖前4:3，神的旨意就是要你们成为圣洁，远避淫行 。
<br>
如果我们将这些串在一起的时候，我们就体会彼得为什么说，‪就如我们所亲爱的兄弟保罗(所写的信)...[彼后3:15]

</span>: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.  
1:5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;  

1:6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;  
1:7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.  
1:8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
1:9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.  
1:10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:  

1:11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  
1:12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.  
1:13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;  
1:14 Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.  
1:15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.  

1:16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.  
1:17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.  
1:18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.  
1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:  
1:20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.  

1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

1:1 作耶稣基督仆人和使徒的西门彼得、写信给那因我们的　神、和〔有古卷无和字〕救主耶稣基督之义、与我们同得一样宝贵信心的人。  
1:2 愿恩惠平安、因你们认识　神和我们主耶稣、多多的加给你们。  
1:3 　神的神能已将一切关乎生命和虔敬的事赐给我们、皆因我们认识那用自己荣耀和美德召我们的主。  
1:4 因此他已将又宝贵又极大的应许赐给我们、叫我们既脱离世上从情欲来的败坏、就得与　神的性情有分。  
1:5 正因这缘故、你们要分外的殷勤。有了信心、又要加上德行。有了德行、又要加上知识。  
 
1:6 有了知识、又要加上节制。有了节制、又要加上忍耐。有了忍耐、又要加上虔敬。  
1:7 有了虔敬、又要加上爱弟兄的心。有了爱弟兄的心、又要加上爱众人的心。  
1:8 你们若充充足足的有这几样、就必使你们在认识我们的主耶稣基督上、不至于闲懒不结果子了。  
1:9 人若没有这几样、就是眼瞎、只看见近处的、忘了他旧日的罪已经得了洁净。  
1:10 所以弟兄们、应当更加殷勤、使你们所蒙的恩召和拣选坚定不移。你们若行这几样、就永不失脚。  

1:11 这样、必叫你们丰丰富富的、得以进入我们主救主耶稣基督永远的国。  
1:12 你们虽然晓得这些事、并且在你们已有的真道上坚固、我却要将这些事常常提醒你们。  
1:13 我以为应当趁我还在这帐棚的时候提醒你们、激发你们。  
1:14 因为知道我脱离这帐棚的时候快到了、正如我们主耶稣基督所指示我的。  
1:15 并且我要尽心竭力、使你们在我去世以后、时常记念这些事。  

1:16 我们从前、将我们主耶稣基督的大能、和他降临的事、告诉你们、并不是随从乖巧捏造的虚言、乃是亲眼见过他的威荣。  
1:17 他从父　神得尊贵荣耀的时候、从极大荣光之中、有声音出来向他说、这是我的爱子、我所喜悦的。  
1:18 我们同他在圣山的时候、亲自听见这声音从天上出来。  
1:19 我们并有先知更确的预言、如同灯照在暗处。你们在这预言上留意、直等到天发亮晨星在你们心里出现的时候、才是好的。  
1:20 第一要紧的、该知道经上所有的预言、没有可随私意解说的。  

1:21 因为预言从来没有出于人意的、乃是人被圣灵感动说出　神的话来。
