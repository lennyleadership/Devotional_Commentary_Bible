13:1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.  
13:2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:  
13:3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.  
13:4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.  
13:5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.  
 
13:6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.  
13:7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.  
13:8 And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.  
13:9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.  
13:10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.  
 
13:11 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.  
13:12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?  
13:13 So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.  
13:14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.

13:1 大卫与千夫长、百夫长、就是一切首领商议。  
13:2 大卫对以色列全会众说、你们若以为美、见这事是出于耶和华我们的　神、我们就差遣人走遍以色列地、见我们未来的弟兄、又见住在有郊野之城的祭司利未人、使他们都到这里来聚集。  
13:3 我们要把　神的约柜运到我们这里来。因为在扫罗年间、我们没有在约柜前求问　神。  
13:4 全会众都说、可以如此行。这事在众民眼中、都看为好。  
13:5 于是大卫将以色列人、从埃及的西曷河、直到哈马口、都招聚了来、要从基列耶琳将　神的约柜运来。  
 
13:6 大卫率领以色列众人、上到巴拉、就是属犹大的基列耶琳、要从那里将约柜运来。这约柜就是坐在二基路伯上、耶和华　神留名的约柜。  
13:7 他们将　神的约柜、从亚比拿达的家里抬出来、放在新车上。乌撒和亚希约赶车。  
13:8 大卫和以色列众人、在　神前用琴、瑟、锣鼓、号、作乐、极力跳舞歌唱。  
13:9 到了基顿的禾场、〔基顿撒母耳下六章六节作拿艮〕  因为牛失前蹄、〔或作惊跳〕  乌撒就伸手扶住约柜。  
13:10 耶和华向他发怒、因他伸手扶住约柜击杀他、他就死在　神面前。  
 
13:11 大卫因耶和华击杀〔原文作闯杀〕  乌撒、心里愁烦、就称那地方为毗列斯乌撒、直到今日。  
13:12 那日大卫惧怕　神、说、　神的约柜、怎可运到我这里来。  
13:13 于是大卫不将约柜运进大卫的城、却运到迦特人俄别以东的家中。  
13:14 　神的约柜在俄别以东家中三个月。耶和华赐福给俄别以东的家和他一切所有的。
