92:1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:  
92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,  
92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.  
92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.  
92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.  

92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.  
92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:  
92:8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.  
92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.  
92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.  

92:11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.  
92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. <a id="1_ref" href = "#1">[1]</a>    
92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.  
92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;  
92:15 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

Matthew Henry's Commentary: He triumphs in God, and his glory and grace. 
1. In the glory of God (Psa_92:8): “But thou, O Lord! art most high for evermore. The workers of iniquity who fight against us may be high for a time, and think to carry all before them with a high hand, but thou art high, most high, for evermore. Their height will be humbled and brought down, but thine is everlasting.” Let us not therefore fear the pride and power of evil men, nor be discouraged by their impotent menaces, for the moth shall eat them up as a garment, but God's righteousness shall be for ever, Isa_51:7, Isa_51:8. 
2. In the grace of God, his favour and the fruits of it, 
(1.) To himself (Psa_92:10): “Thou, O Lord! that art thyself most high, shalt exalt my horn.” The great God is the fountain of honour, and he, being high for evermore, himself will exalt his people for ever, for he is the praise of all his saints, Psa_148:14. The wicked are forbidden to lift up the horn (Psa_75:4, Psa_75:5), but those that serve God and the interest of his kingdom with their honour or power, and commit it to him to keep it, to raise it, to use it, and to dispose of it, as he pleases, may hope that he will exalt their horn as the horn of a unicorn, to the greatest height, either in this world or the other: My horn shalt thou exalt, when thy enemies perish; for then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, when the wicked shall be doomed to shame and everlasting contempt. He adds, I shall be anointed with fresh oil, which denotes a fresh confirmation in his office to which he had been anointed, or abundance of plenty, so that he should have fresh oil as often as he pleased, or renewed comforts to revive him when his spirits drooped. Grace is the anointing of the Spirit; when this is given to help in the time of need, and is received, as there is occasion, from the fulness that is in Christ Jesus, we are then anointed with fresh oil. Some read it, When I grow old thou shalt anoint me with fresh oil. My old age shalt thou exalt with rich mercy; so the Septuagint. Compare Psa_92:14, They shall bring forth fruit in old age. The comforts of God's Spirit, and the joys of his salvation, shall be a refreshing oil to the hoary heads that are found in the way of righteousness. 
(2.) To all the saints. They are here represented as trees of righteousness, Isa_61:3; Psa_1:3. Observe, 
[1.] The good place they are fixed in; they are planted in the house of the Lord, Psa_92:13. The trees of righteousness do not grow of themselves; they are planted, not in common soil, but in paradise, in the house of the Lord. Trees are not usually planted in a house; but God's trees are said to be planted in his house because it is from his grace, by his word and Spirit, that they receive all the sap and virtue that keep them alive and make them fruitful. They fix themselves to holy ordinances, take root in them, abide by them, put themselves under the divine protection, and bring forth all their fruits to God's honour and glory. 
[2.] The good plight they shall be kept in. It is here promised, First, That they shall grow, Psa 92:12. Where God gives true grace he will give more grace. God's trees shall grow higher, like the cedars, the tall cedars in Lebanon; they shall grow nearer heaven, and with a holy ambition shall aspire towards the upper world; they shall grow stronger, like the cedars, and fitter for use. He that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. Secondly, That they shall flourish, both in the credit of their profession and in the comfort and joy of their own souls. They shall be cheerful themselves and respected by all about them. They shall flourish like the palm-tree, which has a stately body (Son 7:7), and large boughs, Lev 23:40; Jdg 4:5. Dates, the fruit of it, are very pleasant, but it is especially alluded to here as being ever green. The wicked flourish as the grass (Psa 92:7), which is soon withered, but the righteous as the palm-tree, which is long-lived and which the winter does not change. It has been said of the palm-tree, Sub pondere crescit - The more it is pressed down the more it grows; so the righteous flourish under their burdens; the more they are afflicted the more they multiply. Being planted in the house of the Lord (there their root is), they flourish in the courts of our God - there their branches spread. Their life is hid with Christ in God. But their light also shines before men. It is desirable that those who have a place should have a name in God's house, and within his walls, Isa 56:5. Let good Christians aim to excel, that they may be eminent and may flourish, and so may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour, as flourishing trees adorn the courts of a house. And let those who flourish in God's courts give him the glory of it; it is by virtue of this promise, They shall be fat and flourishing. Their flourishing without is from a fatness within, from the root and fatness of the good olive, Rom 11:17. Without a living principle of grace in the heart the profession will not be long flourishing; but where that is the leaf also shall not wither, Psa 1:3. The trees of the Lord are full of sap, Psa 104:16. See Hos 14:5, Hos 14:6. Thirdly, That they shall be fruitful. Were there nothing but leaves upon them, they would not be trees of any value; but they shall still bring forth fruit. The products of sanctification, all the instances of a lively devotion and a useful conversation, good works, by which God is glorified and others are edified, these are the fruits of righteousness, in which it is the privilege, as well as the duty, of the righteous to abound; and their abounding in them is the matter of a promise as well as of a command. It is promised that they shall bring forth fruit in old age. Other trees, when they are old, leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes their best days, and their last work is their best work. This indeed shows that they are upright; perseverance is the surest evidence of sincerity. But it is here said to show that the Lord is upright (Psa 92:15), that he is true to his promises and faithful to every word that he has spoken, and that he is constant to the work which he has begun. As it is by the promises that believers first partake of a divine nature, so it is by the promises that that divine nature is preserved and kept up; and therefore the power it exerts is an evidence that the Lord is upright, and so he will show himself with an upright man, Psa 18:25. This the psalmist triumphs in: “He is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him. I have chosen him for my rock on which to build, in the clefts of which to take shelter, on the top of which to set my feet. I have found him a rock, strong and stedfast, and his word as firm as a rock. I have found” (and let every one speak as he finds) “that there is no unrighteousness in him.” He is as able, and will be as kind, as his word makes him to be. All that ever trusted in God found him faithful and all-sufficient, and none were ever made ashamed of their hope in him.

<br><br>Believer's Bible: The prosperity of the righteous is comparable to that of a palm tree and a cedar of Lebanon. The palm tree symbolizes beauty and fruitfulness while the cedar is an emblem of strength and permanence. The reason for the luxuriant growth of believers is that they are planted in the house of the LORD and flourish in the courts of our God. In other words, they live in daily fellowship with the Lord, drawing their strength and sustenance from Him. Age does not impair their fruit-bearing capabilities. They continue to pulsate with vigorous spiritual life (the sap) and their testimony remains ever green. Their prosperity is an evidence that the LORD is upright in fulfilling His promises. He is the dependable rock, and there is nothing unreliable about Him.
<br><br>Life Application Bible Study: Palm trees are known for their long life span.  "To flourish like plam trees" means to stand tall and to live long.  The palms are also an excellent source of dates.  
<br><br>ESV Bible Study: The palm tree represents "long lived and stately". "They flourish in the courts of our God indicates enduring residence in God's presence.  
<br><br>CSB Bible Study: Trees often refer figuratively to the characteristics of national leaders.  
<br><br>MacArthur Bible Study:  The palm tree and the cedar symbolized permanence and strength.
<br><br>The cedars of Lebanon grew to 120 feet in height and up to 30 feet in circumference; thus, they were solid, strong, and immovable.  The writer saw believers as upright, strong, productive, and unmoved by the winds of circumstance and aging.  
<br><br> Swindall Bible Study: In our culture, many people live for the day they can hang it up and retire.  I was talking to a newspaper columnist who said, "Now, how old are you?"  
<br>So I told her.  
<br>"And you've got these plans?" she asked.
<br>"Oh, yeah!"
<br>So she said, "You have a lot of energy.  I thought by now you'd be looking for a place to hang it up."
<br>And I said, "Hang what up?"
<br>I am not looking for a place to hang it up.  I am looking for a place to live it out.  In my old age I want to have as much energy and vigor and life as when I was young.  You can retire from your work, but you don't retire from life or ministry.

# Meditation
Palm tree  is endogenous tree.

inner change will make outward looking change.

inward break-through makes the tree grow.

self-denial is the way of break-through.

Do cedar trees have a large root system?  
The root system of cedar trees depends on the soil condition. The taproot reaches depths of about 7.6 meters or 26 feet and widths of up to 6 meters or 20 feet. Thin rocky soil results in the formation of more fibrous lateral roots. The cedar tree can develop a deep taproot when the soil allows it.
