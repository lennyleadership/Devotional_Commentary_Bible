92:1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:  
92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,  
92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.  
92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.  
92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.  

92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.  
92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:  
92:8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.  
92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.  
92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.  

92:11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.  
92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.<label for="palm" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Life Application Study Bible Commentary: Palm trees are known for their long life span.  "To flourish like plam trees" means to stand tall and to live long.  The palms are also an excellent source of dates.<br>
The cedars of Lebanon grew to 120 feet in height and up to 30 feet in circumference; thus, they were solid, strong, and immovable.  The writer saw believers as upright, strong, productive, and unmoved by the winds of circumstance and aging.</span>  
92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.  
92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;  
92:15 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

92:1 〔安息日的诗歌。〕称谢耶和华、歌颂你至高者的名。  
92:2 用十弦的乐器和瑟、用琴弹幽雅的声音、早晨传扬你的慈爱、每夜传扬你的信实、这本为美事。  
92:3 见上节
92:4 因你耶和华借着你的作为叫我高兴。我要因你手的工作欢呼。  
92:5 耶和华阿、你的工作何其大、你的心思极其深。  

92:6 畜类人不晓得、愚顽人也不明白。  
92:7 恶人茂盛如草、一切作孽之人发旺的时候、正是他们要灭亡、直到永远。  
92:8 惟你耶和华是至高、直到永远。  
92:9 耶和华阿、你的仇敌都要灭亡、一切作孽的也要离散。  
92:10 你却高举了我的角、如野牛的角。我是被新油膏了的。  

92:11 我眼睛看见仇敌遭报、我耳朵听见那些起来攻击我的恶人受罚。  
92:12 义人要发旺如棕树、生长如利巴嫩的香柏树。  
92:13 他们栽于耶和华的殿中、发旺在我们　神的院里。  
92:14 他们年老的时候、仍要结果子。要满了汁浆而常发青。  
92:15 好显明耶和华是正直的、他是我的磐石、在他毫无不义。

# Meditation
Palm tree  is endogenous tree.

inner change will make outward looking change.

inward break-through makes the tree grow.

self-denial is the way of break-through.

Do cedar trees have a large root system?  
The root system of cedar trees depends on the soil condition. The taproot reaches depths of about 7.6 meters or 26 feet and widths of up to 6 meters or 20 feet. Thin rocky soil results in the formation of more fibrous lateral roots. The cedar tree can develop a deep taproot when the soil allows it.
