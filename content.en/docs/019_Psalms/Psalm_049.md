49:1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:  
49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.  
49:3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.  
49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.  
49:5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?  

49:6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;  
49:7 <b>None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him</b>:  
49:8 <b>(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</b><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Mat 16:26, Mat 20:28; 1 Tim 2:6; 1 Peter 1:18<br><br>On the contrast, Jesus was worth of thirty shekels.
<br><br>
Exodus 21:32 NKJV  
If the ox gores a male or female servant, he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

出 埃 及 記 21:32 CUVS
牛 若 触 了 奴 仆 或 是 婢 女 ， 必 将 银 子 三 十 舍 客 勒 给 他 们 的 主 人 ， 也 要 用 石 头 把 牛 打 死 。
</span>  
49:9 <b>That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption</b>.  
49:10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.  

49:11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.  
49:12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.  
49:13 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.  
49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.  
49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.  

49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;  
49:17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.  
49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.  
49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.  
49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.

49:1 〔可拉后裔的诗、交与伶长。〕万民哪、你们都当听这话、世上一切的居民、  
49:2 无论上流下流、富足贫穷、都当留心听。  
49:3 我口要说智慧的言语。我心要想通达的道理。  
49:4 我要侧耳听比喻、用琴解谜语。  
49:5 在患难的日子、奸恶随我脚跟、四面环绕我、我何必惧怕。  

49:6 那些倚仗财货自夸钱财多的人、  
49:7 <b>一个也无法赎自己的弟兄、也不能替他将赎价给　神</b>、  
49:8 <b>叫他长远活着、不见朽坏。因为赎他生命的价值极贵、只可永远罢休</b>。  
49:9 见上节
49:10 他必见智慧人死。又见愚顽人和畜类人、一同灭亡、将他们的财货留给别人。  

49:11 他们心里思想、他们的家室必永存、住宅必留到万代。他们以自己的名、称自己的地。  
49:12 但人居尊贵中不能长久、如同死亡的畜类一样。  
49:13 他们行的这道、本为自己的愚昧。但他们以后的人、还佩服他们的话语。〔细拉〕  
49:14 他们如同羊群派定下阴间。死亡必作他们的牧者。到了早晨、正直人必管辖他们。他们的美容、必被阴间所灭、以致无处可存。  
49:15 只是　神必救赎我的灵魂、脱离阴间的权柄、因他必收纳我。〔细拉〕  

49:16 见人发财家室增荣的时候、你不要惧怕。  
49:17 因为他死的时候、甚么也不能带去。他的荣耀不能随他下去。  
49:18 他活着的时候、虽然自夸为有福、（你若利己、人必夸奖你)
49:19 他仍必归到他历代的祖宗那里、永不见光。  
49:20 人在尊贵中、而不醒悟、就如死亡的畜类一样。
