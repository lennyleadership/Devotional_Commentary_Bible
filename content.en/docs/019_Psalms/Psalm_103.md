103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.  
103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:  
103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;  
103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;  
103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.  

103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.  
103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.  
103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.  
103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.  
103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.  

103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.  
103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.  
103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.  
103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.  
103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. <a class = "marginnote">[v15-18: comfort/ dead/mourning]</a>  

103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.  
103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;  
103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.  
103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.  
103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.  

103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.  
103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.

103:1 〔大卫的诗。〕我的心哪、你要称颂耶和华。凡在我里面的、也要称颂他的圣名。  
103:2 我的心哪、你要称颂耶和华、不可忘记他的一切恩惠。  
103:3 他赦免你的一切罪孽、医治你的一切疾病。  
103:4 他救赎你的命脱离死亡、以仁爱和慈悲为你的冠冕。  
103:5 他用美物、使你所愿的得以知足、以致你如鹰返老还童。  

103:6 耶和华施行公义、为一切受屈的人伸冤。  
103:7 他使摩西知道他的法则、叫以色列人晓得他的作为。  
103:8 耶和华有怜悯、有恩典、不轻易发怒、且有丰盛的慈爱。  
103:9 他不长久责备、也不永远怀怒。  
103:10 他没有按我们的罪过待我们、也没有照我们的罪孽报应我们。  

103:11 天离地何等的高、他的慈爱向敬畏他的人、也是何等的大。  
103:12 东离西有多远、他叫我们的过犯、离我们也有多远。  
103:13 父亲怎样怜恤他的儿女、耶和华也怎样怜恤敬畏他的人。  
103:14 因为他知道我们的本体、思念我们不过是尘土。  
103:15 至于世人、他的年日如草一样。他发旺如野地的花。  

103:16 经风一吹、便归无有。他的原处、也不再认识他。  
103:17 但耶和华的慈爱、归于敬畏他的人、从亘古到永远。他的公义、也归于子子孙孙。  
103:18 就是那些遵守他的约、记念他的训词而遵行的人。  
103:19 耶和华在天上立定宝座。他的权柄〔原文作国〕统管万有。  
103:20 听从他命令成全他旨意有大能的天使、都要称颂耶和华。  

103:21 你们作他的诸军作他的仆役行他所喜悦的、都要称颂耶和华。  
103:22 你们一切被他造的、在他所治理的各处、都要称颂耶和华。我的心哪、你要称颂耶和华。
