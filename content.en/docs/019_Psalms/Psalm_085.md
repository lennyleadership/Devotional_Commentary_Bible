85:1 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast <b>brought back the captivity</b><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">"turned the fortunes", is a Hebrew way to say "changed things from bad to good, or good to bad". In English, we would say "their luck changed". Christians do not believe in luck. Luck means "things just happen". Christians believe that God decides what happens. <a href = "https://www.easyenglish.bible/psalms/psalm085-taw.htm#:~:text=Many%20Bible%20students%20think%20that,was%20angry%20with%20his%20people." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easyenglish Bible</a></span> of Jacob.  
85:2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.  
85:3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.  
85:4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.  
85:5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?  

85:6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?  
85:7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.  
85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.  
85:9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.  
85:10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.  

85:11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.  
85:12 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.  
85:13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">verse 13, is very interesting. It tells us that God would walk on the earth! This happened when Jesus came, 520 years later. Many Bible students think that all the last part of the psalm is about Jesus. Because Jesus was the Messiah, they call verses 9-13 <b>the messianic part</b> of the psalm. <a href = "https://www.easyenglish.bible/psalms/psalm085-taw.htm#:~:text=Many%20Bible%20students%20think%20that,was%20angry%20with%20his%20people." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easyenglish Bible</a></span>

85:1 〔可拉后裔的诗、交与伶长。〕耶和华阿、你已经向你的地施恩、救回被掳的雅各。  
85:2 你赦免了你百姓的罪孽、遮盖了他们一切的过犯。〔细拉〕  
85:3 你收转了所发的忿怒、和你猛烈的怒气。  
85:4 拯救我们的　神阿、求你使我们回转、叫你的恼恨向我们止息。  
85:5 你要向我们发怒到永远么、你要将你的怒气延留到万代么。  

85:6 你不再将我们救活、使你的百姓靠你欢喜么。  
85:7 耶和华阿、求你使我们得见你的慈爱、又将你的救恩赐给我们。  
85:8 我要听　神耶和华所说的话。因为他必应许将平安赐给他的百姓、他的圣民。他们却不可再转去妄行。  
85:9 他的救恩、诚然与敬畏他的人相近、叫荣耀住在我们的地上。  
85:10 慈爱和诚实、彼此相遇。公义和平安、彼此相亲。  

85:11 诚实从地而生、公义从天而现。  
85:12 耶和华必将好处赐给我们。我们的地、也要多出土产。  
85:13 公义要行在他面前、叫他的脚踪、成为可走的路。

Psalm 85:10 is a prayer, and was answered 520 years after.  The sons of Korah became a music group.  

Here are some verses from the New Testament of the Bible.[<a href = "https://www.easyenglish.bible/psalms/psalm085-taw.htm#:~:text=Many%20Bible%20students%20think%20that,was%20angry%20with%20his%20people." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easyenglish Bible</a>]

1) Luke 2:14. Glory to God in the heavens, and peace to his saints on earth.  
2) John 1:14. The Word became a man and lived with us and we saw his glory. (The Word is one of Jesus’ Bible names.)  
3) Romans 5:1. Because we have been made righteous through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. (Faith means that we accept the kind love of God.)  
4) Matthew 1:21. Jesus will save his people from their sins.
