34:1 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.  
34:2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.  
34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.  
34:4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.  
34:5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.  

34:6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.  
34:7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.  
34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.  
34:9 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.  
34:10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.  

34:11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.  
34:12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?  
34:13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.  
34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.  
34:15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.  

34:16 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.  
34:17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.  
34:18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.  
34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.  
34:20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.  

34:21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.  
34:22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.

34:1 〔大卫在亚比米勒面前装疯、被他赶出去、就作这诗。〕我要时时称颂耶和华。赞美他的话必常在我口中。  
34:2 我的心必因耶和华夸耀。谦卑人听见、就要喜乐。  
34:3 你们和我当称耶和华为大、一同高举他的名。  
34:4 我曾寻求耶和华、他就应允我、救我脱离了一切的恐惧。

34:10 少壮狮子、还缺食忍饿。但寻求耶和华的、甚么好处都不缺。  

34:11 众弟子阿、你们当来听我的话。我要将敬畏耶和华的道、教训你们。  
34:12 有何人喜好存活、爱慕长寿、得享美福。  
34:13 就要禁止舌头不出恶言、嘴唇不说诡诈的话。  
34:14 要离恶行善、寻求和睦、一心追赶<label for="追赶" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">这句话给我的提醒是：当我们愿意就近光后，我们也要有回应。所以“敬畏神”是上帝与信者之间的互动。<br>神学上有两派观点：是上帝拣选有的人得救？我觉得上帝早已将祂的心意启示给人类，历世历代好多基督徒也在传播上帝心意，</span>。  
34:15 耶和华的眼目、看顾义人、他的耳朵、听他们的呼求。  

34:16 耶和华向行恶的人变脸、要从世上除灭他们的名号。

34:19 义人多有苦难。但耶和华救他脱离这一切。  
34:20 又保全他一身的骨头、连一根也不折断。  

34:21 恶必害死恶人。恨恶义人的、必被定罪。  
34:22 耶和华救赎他仆人的灵魂。凡投靠他的、必不至定罪。
