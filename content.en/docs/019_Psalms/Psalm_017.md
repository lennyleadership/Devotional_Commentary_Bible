17:1 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.  
17:2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.  
17:3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.  
17:4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.  
17:5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.  

17:6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.  
17:7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.  
17:8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,  
17:9 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.  
17:10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.  

17:11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;  
17:12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.  
17:13 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:  
17:14 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.  
17:15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

17:1 〔大卫的祈祷。〕耶和华阿、求你听闻公义、侧耳听我的呼吁。求你留心听我这不出于诡诈嘴唇的祈祷。  
17:2 愿我的判语从你面前发出。愿你的眼睛观看公正。  
17:3 你已经试验我的心。你在夜间鉴察我。你熬炼我、却找不着甚么。我立志叫我口中没有过失。  
17:4 论到人的行为、我借着你嘴唇的言语、自己谨守、不行强暴人的道路。  
17:5 我的脚踏定了你的路径、我的两脚未曾滑跌。  

17:6 　神阿、我曾求告你、因为你必应允我。求你向我侧耳、听我的言语。  
17:7 求你显出你奇妙的慈爱来。你是那用右手拯救投靠你的、脱离起来攻击他们的人。  
17:8 求你保护我、如同保护眼中的瞳人。将我隐藏在你翅膀的荫下、  
17:9 使我脱离那欺压我的恶人、就是围困我、要害我命的仇敌。  
17:10 他们的心被脂油包裹。他们用口说骄傲的话。  

17:11 他们围困了我们的脚步。他们瞪着眼、要把我们推倒在地。  
17:12 他像狮子急要抓食、又像少壮狮子蹲伏在暗处。  
17:13 耶和华阿、求你起来、前去迎敌、将他打倒。用你的刀救护我命脱离恶人。  
17:14 耶和华阿、求你用手救我脱离世人、脱离那只在今生有福分的世人。你把你的财宝充满他们的肚腹。他们因有儿女就心满意足、将其余的财物留给他们的婴孩。  
17:15 至于我、我必在义中见你的面。我醒了的时候、得见你的形像、〔见或作看〕就心满意足了。
