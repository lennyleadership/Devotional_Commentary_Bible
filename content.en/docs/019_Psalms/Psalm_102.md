102:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.  
102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.  
102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.  
102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.  
102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.  

102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.  
102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.  
102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.  
102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,  
102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.  

102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.  
102:12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.  
102:13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.  
102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.  
102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.  

102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.  
102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.  
102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.  
102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;  
102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;  

102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;  
102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.  
102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.  
102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.  
102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.  

102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:  
102:27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.  
102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.

102:1 〔困苦人发昏的时候、在耶和华面前吐露苦情的祷告。〕耶和华阿、求你听我的祷告、容我的呼求达到你面前。<label for="prayer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">祷告需要全人的投入,包括思想祷灵和身体。当一个人祷告的时候所有属于他的都会因着祷告而得着益处。因此，在祷告之时必须将自己及属乎自己的一切都交于神手中。

102:2 我在急难的日子、求你向我侧耳、不要向我掩面。我呼求的日子、求你快快应允我。  
102:3 因为我的年日、如烟云消灭、我的骨头、如火把烧着。  
102:4 我的心被伤、如草枯干、甚至我忘记吃饭。  
102:5 因我唉哼的声音、我的肉紧贴骨头。  

102:6 我如同旷野的鹈鹕。我好像荒场的鸮鸟。  
102:7 我儆醒不睡。我像房顶上孤单的麻雀。  
102:8 我的仇敌终日辱骂我。向我猖狂的人、指着我赌咒。  
102:9 我吃过炉灰、如同吃饭。我所喝的与眼泪搀杂。  
102:10 这都因你的恼恨和忿怒。你把我拾起来、又把我摔下去。  

102:11 我的年日、如日影偏斜。我也如草枯干。  
102:12 惟你耶和华必存到永远。你可记念的名、也存到万代。  
102:13 你必起来怜恤锡安、因现在是可怜他的时候。日期已经到了。  
102:14 你的仆人原来喜悦他的石头、可怜他的尘土。  
102:15 列国要敬畏耶和华的名。世上诸王都敬畏你的荣耀。  

102:16 因为耶和华建造了锡安、在他荣耀里显现。  
102:17 他垂听穷人的祷告、并不藐视他们的祈求。  
102:18 这必为后代的人记下。将来受造的民、要赞美耶和华。  
102:19 因为他从至高的圣所垂看。耶和华从天向地观察。  
102:20 要垂听被囚之人的叹息。要释放将要死的人。  

102:21 使人在锡安传扬耶和华的名、在耶路撒冷传扬赞美他的话。  
102:22 就是在万民和列国聚会事奉耶和华的时候。  
102:23 他使我的力量、中道衰弱、使我的年日短少。  
102:24 我说、我的　神阿、不要使我中年去世。你的年数、世世无穷。  
102:25 你起初立了地的根基。天也是你手所造的。  

102:26 天地都要灭没、你却要长存。天地都要如外衣渐渐旧了。你要将天地如里衣更换、天地就改变了。  
102:27 惟有你永不改变。你的年数没有穷尽。  
102:28 你仆人的子孙要长存。他们的后裔、要坚立在你面前。

102:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.  

<div class = "note">
Matthew 26:39,42,44 LSB   
[39] And He went a little beyond them, and fell on His face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will.”    
[42] He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done.”    
[44] And He left them again, and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more.  

太 26:39,42,44 CUVS   
[39] 他 就 稍 往 前 走 ， 俯 伏 在 地 ， 祷 告 说 ： 我 父 阿 ， 倘 若 可 行 ， 求 你 叫 这 杯 离 开 我 。 然 而 ， 不 要 照 我 的 意 思 ， 只 要 照 你 的 意 思 。     
[42] 第 二 次 又 去 祷 告 说 ： 我 父 阿 ， 这 杯 若 不 能 离 开 我 ， 必 要 我 喝 ， 就 愿 你 的 意 旨 成 全 。    
[44] 耶 稣 又 离 开 他 们 去 了 。 第 三 次 祷 告 ， 说 的 话 还 是 与 先 前 一 样 。

<div class = "note">
路加 22:43-44 CUVS   
[43] 有 一 位 天 使 从 天 上 显 现 ， 加 添 他 的 力 量 。   
[44] 耶 稣 极 其 伤 痛 ， 祷 告 更 加 恳 切 ， 汗 珠 如 大 血 点 滴 在 地 上 。

Luke 22:43-44 LSB  
[43] Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.   
[44] And being in agony He was praying very fervently, and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground.

门徒约翰虽然没有记载耶稣在克西马尼园的祷告内容，但记载了一段耶稣平时的祷告内容，说明这个祷词时时萦绕在耶稣的心头。  
John 12:27 CUVS  
我 现 在 心 里 忧 愁 ， 我 说 甚 麽 才 好 呢 ？ 父 阿 ， 救 我 脱 离 这 时 候 ； 但 我 原 是 为 这 时 候 来 的 。  
John 12:27 LSB  
“Now MY SOUL HAS BECOME DISMAYED; and what shall I say, ‘Father, SAVE ME from this hour’? But for this purpose I came to this hour.
