78:1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.  
78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:  
78:3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.  
78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.  
78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:  

78:6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:  
78:7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:  
78:8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.  
78:9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.  
78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;  

78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.  
78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.  
78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.  
78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.  
78:15 He clave the <b>rocks</b> in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">It is plural. 2025.02.10</span>.  

78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.  
78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.  
78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.  
78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?  
78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?  

78:21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;  
78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:  
78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,  
78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.  
78:25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.  

78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.  
78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:  
78:28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.  
78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;  
78:30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,  

78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.  
78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.  
78:33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.  
78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.  
78:35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.  

78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.  
78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.  
78:38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.  
78:39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.  
78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!  

78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.  
78:42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.  
78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:  
78:44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.  
78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.  

78:46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.  
78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.  
78:48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.  
78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.  
78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;  

78:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:  
78:52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.  
78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.  
78:54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.  
78:55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.  

78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:  
78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.  
78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.  
78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:  
78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;  

78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.  
78:62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.  
78:63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.  
78:64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.  
78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.  

78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.  
78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:  
78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.  
78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.  
78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:  

78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.  
78:72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

78:1 〔亚萨的训诲诗。〕我的民哪、你们要留心听我的训诲、侧耳听我口中的话。  
78:2 我要开口说比喻。我要说出古时的谜语。  
78:3 是我们所听见所知道的、也是我们的祖宗告诉我们的。  
78:4 我们不将这些事向他们的子孙隐瞒。要将耶和华的美德和他的能力、并他奇妙的作为、述说给后代听。  
78:5 因为他在雅各中立法度、在以色列中设律法、是他吩咐我们祖宗、要传给子孙的。  

78:6 使将要生的后代子孙、可以晓得。他们也要起来告诉他们的子孙。  
78:7 好叫他们仰望　神、不忘记　神的作为。惟要守他的命令。  
78:8 不要像他们的祖宗、是顽梗悖逆居心不正之辈、向着　神心不诚实。  
78:9 以法莲的子孙、带着兵器、拿着弓、临阵之日、转身退后。  
78:10 他们不遵守　神的约、不肯照他的律法行。  

78:11 又忘记他所行的、和他显给他们奇妙的作为。  
78:12 他在埃及地、在琐安田、在他们祖宗的眼前、施行奇事。  
78:13 他将海分裂、使他们过去。又叫水立起如垒。  
78:14 他白日用云彩、终夜用火光、引导他们。  
78:15 他在旷野分裂磐石、多多的给他们水喝、如从深渊而出。  

78:16 他使水从磐石涌出、叫水如江河下流。  
78:17 他们却仍旧得罪他、在干燥之地悖逆至高者。  
78:18 他们心中试探　神、随自己所欲的求食物。  
78:19 并且妄论　神、说、　神在旷野岂能摆设筵席么。  
78:20 他曾击打磐石、使水涌出、成了江河。他还能赐粮食么。还能为他的百姓预备肉么。  

78:21 所以耶和华听见、就发怒。有烈火向雅各烧起、有怒气向以色列上腾。  
78:22 因为他们不信服　神、不倚赖他的救恩。  
78:23 他却吩咐天空、又敞开天上的门、  
78:24 降吗哪像雨给他们吃、将天上的粮食赐给他们。  
78:25 各人〔或作人〕吃大能者的食物。他赐下粮食、使他们饱足。  

78:26 他领东风起在天空、又用能力引了南风来。  
78:27 他降肉像雨在他们当中、多如尘土、又降飞鸟、多如海沙、  
78:28 落在他们的营中、在他们住处的四面。  
78:29 他们吃了、而且饱足。这样、就随了他们所欲的。  
78:30 他们贪而无厌、食物还在他们口中的时候、  

78:31 　神的怒气、就向他们上腾、杀了他们内中的肥壮人、打倒以色列的少年人。  
78:32 虽是这样、他们仍旧犯罪、不信他奇妙的作为。  
78:33 因此他叫他们的日子、全归虚空、叫他们的年岁、尽属惊恐。  
78:34 他杀他们的时候、他们才求问他、回心转意、切切的寻求　神。  
78:35 他们也追念　神是他们的磐石、至高的　神、是他们的救赎主。  

78:36 他们却用口谄媚他、用舌向他说谎。  
78:37 因他们的心向他不正、在他的约上也不忠心。  
78:38 但他有怜悯、赦免他们的罪孽、不灭绝他们。而且屡次消他的怒气、不发尽他的忿怒。  
78:39 他想到他们不过是血气、是一阵去而不返的风。  
78:40 他们在旷野悖逆他、在荒地叫他担忧、何其多呢。  

78:41 他们再三试探　神、惹动以色列的圣者。  
78:42 他们不追念他的能力、〔原文作手〕和赎他们脱离敌人的日子。  
78:43 他怎样在埃及地显神迹、在琐安田显奇事、  
78:44 把他们的江河、并河汊的水、都变为血、使他们不能喝。  
78:45 他叫苍蝇成群、落在他们当中、嘬尽他们。又叫青蛙灭了他们。  

78:46 把他们的土产交给蚂蚱、把他们辛苦得来的交给蝗虫。  
78:47 他降冰雹打坏他们的葡萄树。下严霜打坏他们的桑树。  
78:48 又把他们的牲畜交给冰雹。把他们的群畜交给闪电。  
78:49 他使猛烈的怒气、和忿怒、恼恨、苦难、成了一群降灾的使者、临到他们。  
78:50 他为自己的怒气修平了路、将他们交给瘟疫、使他们死亡。  

78:51 在埃及击杀一切长子、在含的帐棚中、击杀他们强壮时头生的。  
78:52 他却领出自己的民如羊、在旷野引他们如羊群。  
78:53 他领他们稳稳妥妥的、使他们不至害怕。海却淹没他们的仇敌。  
78:54 他带他们到自己圣地的边界、到他右手所得的这山地。  
78:55 他在他们面前赶出外邦人、用绳子将外邦的地量给他们为业、叫以色列支派的人住在他们的帐棚里。  

78:56 他们仍旧试探悖逆至高的　神、不守他的法度。  
78:57 反倒退后、行诡诈、像他们的祖宗一样。他们改变、如同翻背的弓。  
78:58 因他们的丘坛、惹了他的怒气、因他们雕刻的偶像、触动他的愤恨。  
78:59 　神听见、就发怒、极其憎恶以色列人。  
78:60 甚至他离弃示罗的帐幕、就是他在人间所搭的帐棚。  

78:61 又将他的约柜〔原文作能力〕交与人掳去、将他的荣耀交在敌人手中。  
78:62 并将他的百姓交与刀剑、向他的产业发怒。  
78:63 少年人被火烧灭。处女也无喜歌。  
78:64 祭司倒在刀下。寡妇却不哀哭。  
78:65 那时主像世人睡醒、像勇士饮酒呼喊。  

78:66 他就打退了他的敌人、叫他们永蒙羞辱。  
78:67 并且他弃掉约瑟的帐棚、不拣选以法莲支派、  
78:68 却拣选犹大支派、他所喜爱的锡安山。  
78:69 盖造他的圣所、好像高峰、又像他建立永存之地。  
78:70 又拣选他的仆人大卫、从羊圈中将他召来。  

78:71 叫他不再跟从那些带奶的母羊、为要牧养自己的百姓雅各、和自己的产业以色列。  
78:72 于是他按心中的纯正、牧养他们、用手中的巧妙、引导他们。
