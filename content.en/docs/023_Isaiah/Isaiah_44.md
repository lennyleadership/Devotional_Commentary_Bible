44:1 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:  
44:2 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.  
44:3 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:  
44:4 And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.  
44:5 One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall <b>subscribe with his hand</b> unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel<label for="subscribe" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">engraving, or tattoo</span>.  

44:6 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  
44:7 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.  
44:8 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.  
44:9 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.  
44:10 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?  

44:11 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.  
44:12 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.  
44:13 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.  
44:14 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.  
44:15 Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.  

44:16 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:  
44:17 And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.  
44:18 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.  
44:19 And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?  
44:20 He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?  

44:21 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.  
44:22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.  
44:23 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.  
44:24 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;  
44:25 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;

44:26 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:  
44:27 That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:  
44:28 That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

44:1 我的仆人雅各、我所拣选的以色列阿、现在你当听。  
44:2 造作你、又从你出胎造就你、并要帮助你的耶和华如此说、我的仆人雅各、我所拣选的耶书仑哪、不要害怕。  
44:3 因为我要将水浇灌口渴的人、将河浇灌干旱之地。我要将我的灵浇灌你的后裔、将我的福浇灌你的子孙。  
44:4 他们要发生在草中、像溪水旁的柳树。  
44:5 这个要说、我是属耶和华的。那个要以雅各的名自称。又一个要亲手写归耶和华的、〔或作在手上写归耶和华〕并自称为以色列。  

44:6 耶和华以色列的君、以色列的救赎主万军之耶和华如此说、我是首先的、我是末后的、除我以外、再没有真神。  
44:7 自从我设立古时的民、谁能像我宣告、并且指明、又为自己陈说呢。让他将未来的事、和必成的事说明。  
44:8 你们不要恐惧、也不要害怕。我岂不是从上古就说明指示你们么、并且你们是我的见证、除我以外、岂有真神么、诚然没有磐石、我不知道一个。  
44:9 制造雕刻偶像的、尽都虚空。他们所喜悦的、都无益处。他们的见证、无所看见、无所知晓、他们便觉羞愧。  
44:10 谁制造神像、铸造无益的偶像。  

44:11 看哪、他的同伴都必羞愧、工匠也不过是人。任他们聚会、任他们站立、都必惧怕、一同羞愧。  
44:12 铁匠把铁在火炭中烧热、用锤打铁器、用他有力的膀臂锤成。他饥饿而无力、不喝水而发倦。  
44:13 木匠拉线、用笔画出样子。用刨子刨成形状、用圆尺画了模样、仿照人的体态、作成人形、好住在房屋中。  
44:14 他砍伐香柏树、又取柞〔或作青桐〕树和橡树、在树林中选定了一棵。他栽种松树得雨长养、  
44:15 这树、人可用以烧火、他自己取些烤火、又烧着烤饼。而且作神像跪拜、作雕刻的偶像向他叩拜。  

44:16 他把一分烧在火中、把一分烤肉吃饱。自己烤火说、阿哈、我暖和了、我见火了。  
44:17 他用剩下的作了一神、就是雕刻的偶像、他向这偶像俯伏叩拜、祷告他说、求你拯救我、因你是我的神。  
44:18 他们不知道、也不思想、因为耶和华闭住他们的眼不能看见、塞住他们的心不能明白。  
44:19 谁心里也不醒悟、也没有知识、没有聪明、能说、我曾拿一分在火中烧了、在炭火上烤过饼、我也烤过肉吃、这剩下的、我岂要作可憎的物么。我岂可向木橔子叩拜呢。  
44:20 他以灰为食、心中昏迷、使他偏邪、他不能自救、也不能说、我右手中岂不是有虚谎么。  

44:21 雅各、以色列阿、你是我的仆人、要记念这些事。以色列阿、你是我的仆人、我造就你必不忘记你。  
44:22 我涂抹了你的过犯、像厚云消散。我涂抹了你的罪恶、如薄云灭没。你当归向我、因我救赎了你。  
44:23 诸天哪、应当歌唱、因为耶和华作成这事。地的深处阿、应当欢呼、众山应当发声歌唱、树林和其中所有的树、都当如此、因为耶和华救赎了雅各、并要因以色列荣耀自己。  
44:24 从你出胎、造就你的救赎主耶和华如此说、我耶和华是创造万物的、是独自铺张诸天、铺开大地的。（谁与我同在呢)
44:25 使说假话的兆头失效、使占卜的癫狂、使智慧人退后、使他的知识变为愚拙。  

44:26 使我仆人的话语立定、我使者的谋算成就。论到耶路撒冷说、必有人居住。论到犹大的城邑说、必被建造。其中的荒场我也必兴起。  
44:27 对深渊说、你干了吧。我也要使你的江河干涸。  
44:28 论古列说、他是我的牧人、必成就我所喜悦的、必下令建造耶路撒冷、发命立稳圣殿的根基。
