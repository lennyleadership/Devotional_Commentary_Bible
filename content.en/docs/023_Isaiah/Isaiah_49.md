49:1 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.  
49:2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;  
49:3 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.  
49:4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.  
49:5 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.  

49:6 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.  
49:7 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.  
49:8 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;  
49:9 That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.  
49:10 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.  

49:11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.  
49:12 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.  
49:13 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.  
49:14 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.  
49:15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.  

49:16 Behold, I have <b>graven thee upon the palms of my hands</b>; thy walls are continually before me.<label for="graven" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">engraving, tattoo <br> our names were engraven on God's palm of hands</span>  
49:17 Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.  
49:18 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.  
49:19 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.  
49:20 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.  

49:21 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?  
49:22 Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.  
49:23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.  
49:24 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?  
49:25 But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.  

49:26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

49:1 众海岛阿、当听我言。远方的众民哪、留心而听。自我出胎、耶和华就选召我、自出母腹、他就提我的名。  
49:2 他使我的口如快刀、将我藏在他手荫之下。又使我成为磨亮的箭、将我藏在他箭袋之中。  
49:3 对我说、你是我的仆人以色列、我必因你得荣耀。  
49:4 我却说、我劳碌是徒然、我尽力是虚无虚空、然而我当得的理必在耶和华那里、我的赏赐必在我　神那里。  
49:5 耶和华从我出胎造就我作他的仆人、要使雅各归向他、使以色列到他那里聚集。（原来耶和华看我为尊贵、我的　神也成为我的力量)

49:6 现在他说、你作我的仆人、使雅各众支派复兴、使以色列中得保全的归回、尚为小事、我还要使你作外邦人的光、叫你施行我的救恩、直到地极。  
49:7 救赎主以色列的圣者耶和华、对那被人所藐视、本国所憎恶、官长所虐待的、如此说、君王要看见就站起、首领也要下拜、都因信实的耶和华、就是拣选你以色列的圣者。  
49:8 耶和华如此说、在悦纳的时候我应允了你、在拯救的日子我济助了你、我要保护你、使你作众民的中保、〔中保原文作约〕复兴遍地、使人承受荒凉之地为业。  
49:9 对那被捆绑的人说、出来吧。对那在黑暗的人说、显露吧。他们在路上必得饮食、在一切净光的高处必有食物。  
49:10 不饥不渴、炎热和烈日必不伤害他们、因为怜恤他们的、必引导他们、领他们到水泉旁边。  

49:11 我必使我的众山成为大道、我的大路也被修高。  
49:12 看哪、这些从远方来、这些从北方、从西方来、这些从秦国来。〔秦原文作希尼〕
49:13 诸天哪、应当欢呼。大地阿、应当快乐。众山哪、应当发声歌唱。因为耶和华已经安慰他的百姓、也要怜恤他困苦之民。  
49:14 锡安说、耶和华离弃了我、主忘记了我。  
49:15 妇人焉能忘记他吃奶的婴孩、不怜恤他所生的儿子。即或有忘记的、我却不忘记你。  

49:16 看哪、我将你铭刻在我掌上、你的墙垣常在我眼前。  
49:17 你的儿女必急速归回、毁坏你的、使你荒废的、必都离你出去。  
49:18 你举目向四方观看、他们都聚集来到你这里。耶和华说、我指着我的永生起誓、你必要以他们为妆饰佩戴、以他们为华带束腰、像新妇一样。  
49:19 至于你荒废凄凉之处、并你被毁坏之地、现今众民居住必显为太窄。吞灭你的必离你遥远。  
49:20 你必听见丧子之后所生的儿女说、这地方我居住太窄、求你给我地方居住。  

49:21 那时你心里必说、我既丧子独居、是被掳的、漂流在外、谁给我生这些、谁将这些养大呢。撇下我一人独居的时候、这些在哪里呢。  
49:22 主耶和华如此说、我必向列国举手、向万民竖立大旗、他们必将你的众子怀中抱来、将你的众女肩上扛来。  
49:23 列王必作你的养父、王后必作你的乳母。他们必将脸伏地、向你下拜、并餂你脚上的尘土。你便知道我是耶和华、等候我的必不至羞愧。  
49:24 勇士抢去的岂能夺回、该掳掠的岂能解救么。  
49:25 但耶和华如此说、就是勇士所掳掠的、也可以夺回、强暴人所抢的、也可以解救、与你相争的我必与他相争、我要拯救你的儿女。  

49:26 并且我必使那欺压你的吃自己的肉、也要以自己的血喝醉、好像喝甜酒一样。凡有血气的、必都知道我耶和华是你的救主、是你的救赎主、是雅各的大能者。
