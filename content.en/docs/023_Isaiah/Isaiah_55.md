55:1 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.  
55:2 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.  
55:3 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.  
55:4 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.  
55:5 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.  

55:6 <b>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found</b><label for="found" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Psalm 32:6</span>, call ye upon him while he is near:  
55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.  
55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.  
55:9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.  
55:10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:  

55:11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.  
55:12 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.  
55:13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.

55:1 你们一切干渴的都当就近水来。没有银钱的也可以来。你们都来、买了吃。不用银钱、不用价值、也来买酒和奶。  
55:2 你们为何花钱〔原文作平银〕买那不足为食物的、用劳碌得来的买那不使人饱足的呢。你们要留意听我的话、就能吃那美物、得享肥甘、心中喜乐。  
55:3 你们当就近我来。侧耳而听、就必得活。我必与你们立永约、就是应许大卫那可靠的恩典。  
55:4 我已立他作万民的见证、为万民的君王和司令。  
55:5 你素不认识的国民、你也必召来。素不认识你的国民、也必向你奔跑、都因耶和华你的　神以色列的圣者。因为他已经荣耀你。  

55:6 当<b>趁耶和华可寻找的时候</b>寻找他、相近的时候求告他。  
55:7 恶人当离弃自己的道路。不义的人当除掉自己的意念、归向耶和华、耶和华就必怜恤他。当归向我们的　神、因为　神必广行赦免。  
55:8 耶和华说、我的意念、非同你们的意念、我的道路、非同你们的道路。  
55:9 天怎样高过地、照样我的道路、高过你们的道路、我的意念、高过你们的意念。  
55:10 雨雪从天而降、并不返回、却滋润地土、使地上发芽结实、使撒种的有种、使要吃的有粮。  

55:11 我口所出的话、也必如此、决不徒然返回、却要成就我所喜悦的、在我发他去成就的事上〔发他去成就或作所命定〕必然亨通。  
55:12 你们必欢欢喜喜而出来、平平安安蒙引导。大山小山必在你们面前发声歌唱。田野的树木也都拍掌。  
55:13 松树长出代替荆棘。番石榴长出代替蒺藜。这要为耶和华留名、作为永远的证据、不能剪除。
