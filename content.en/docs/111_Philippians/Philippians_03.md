3:1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.  
3:2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.  
3:3 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.  
3:4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:  
3:5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;  

3:6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.  
3:7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.  
3:8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,  
3:9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:  
3:10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;  

3:11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.  
3:12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.  
3:13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,  
3:14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.  
3:15 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.  

3:16 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.  
3:17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.  
3:18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:  
3:19 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
3:20 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:  

3:21 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.

3:1 弟兄们、我还有话说、你们要靠主喜乐。我把这话再写给你们、于我并不为难、于你们却是妥当。  
3:2 应当防备犬类、防备作恶的、防备妄自行割的。  
3:3 因为真受割礼的、乃是我们这以　神的灵敬拜、在基督耶稣里夸口、不靠着肉体的。  
3:4 其实我也可以靠肉体。若是别人想他可以靠肉体、我更可以靠着了。  
3:5 我第八天受割礼、我是以色列族、便雅悯支派的人、是希伯来人所生的希伯来人。就律法说、我是法利赛人。  

3:6 就热心说、我是逼迫教会的。就律法上的义说、我是无可指摘的。  
3:7 只是我先前以为与我有益的、我现在因基督都当作有损的。  
3:8 不但如此、我也将万事当作有损的、因我以认识我主基督耶稣为至宝。我为他已经丢弃万事、看作粪土、为要得着基督。  
3:9 并且得以在他里面、不是有自己因律法而得的义、乃是有信基督的义、就是因信　神而来的义。  
3:10 使我认识基督、晓得他复活的大能、并且晓得和他一同受苦、效法他的死。  

3:11 或者我也得以从死里复活。  
3:12 这不是说、我已经得着了、已经完全了。我乃是竭力追求、或者可以得着基督耶稣所以得着我的。〔所以得着我的或作所要我得的〕  
3:13 弟兄们、我不是以为自己已经得着了。我只有一件事、就是忘记背后努力面前的、  
3:14 向着标竿直跑、要得　神在基督耶稣里从上面召我来得的奖赏。  
3:15 所以我们中间凡是完全人、总要存这样的心。若在甚么事上、存别样的心、神也必以此指示你们。  

3:16 然而我们到了甚么地步、就当照着甚么地步行。  
3:17 弟兄们、你们要一同效法我、也当留意看那些照我们榜样行的人。  
3:18 因为有许多人行事、是基督十字架的仇敌。我屡次告诉你们、现在又流泪的告诉你们。  
3:19 他们的结局就是沉沦、他们的　神就是自己的肚腹、他们以自己的羞辱为荣耀、专以地上的事为念。  
3:20 我们却是天上的国民。并且等候救主、就是主耶稣基督、从天上降临。  

3:21 他要按着那能叫万有归服自己的大能、将我们这卑贱的身体改变形状、和他自己荣耀的身体相似。
