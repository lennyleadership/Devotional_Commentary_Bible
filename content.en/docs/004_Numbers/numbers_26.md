26:63 这些就是被摩西和祭司以利亚撒所数的、他们在摩押平原、与耶利哥相对的约但河边、数点以色列人。  
26:64 但被数的人中、没有一个是摩西和祭司亚伦、从前在西乃的旷野所数的以色列人。  
26:65 因为耶和华论到他们说、他们必要死在旷野、所以除了耶孚尼的儿子迦勒、和嫩的儿子约书亚以外、连一个人也没有存留。

<div id="sons_of_korah" class="tabcontent">

God did not curse sons of Korah the same way God cursed Cannon, the son of Han.  Han saw Noah nakedness and did something on him, so Cannon and his descedents became slaves to other brothers.  

I think God could have cursed the sons of Korah in the same manner in which God dealt with Canaan, the son of Ham. However, He chose to have mercy on them. Why? I think what made the difference is that Korah belonged to Levi, a tribe set apart by God. As it says in Romans 11:22 ESV  
Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God’s kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off.  
Unlike other people, God treated the people he chose with mercy and grace. Why so? God revealed himself as the sovereign, righteous, and merciful One.

Perhaps the most telling point about these saved sons of Korah is the way the LORD graciously used them in His service in years to come. The prophet Samuel was a descendant of Korah (1 Chronicles 6:31-38). The Korahites were assigned the task of custodian and doorkeeper for the Tabernacle (1 Chronicles 9:19-21). Among King David’s military men were a group of Korahites commended for their expertise. (1 Chronicles 12:1-6) <a href = "https://melissamclaughlin.org/2020/10/22/who-were-the-sons-of-korah-in-the-bible/#comment-28328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A comment on Melissa Mclaughlin Blog</a>.

It is interesting to note that Elkanah was not doing temple service. Although Korah’s sons were spared for separating them from their father’s rebellion, they were not allowed to do temple service from then on. Hannah’s cry to the Lord restored Elkanah’s line to service in the temple.  
Also notable is that the Psalms before Ps 45:10 are all a cry, a seeking and yearning for God. The mood of the Psalms after that change notably to praise, thanksgiving and worship.  
In 2 Chron 29:14 we find the same family line, and they changed their name from “sons of Korah” to “sons of Heman”. Heman was a grandson of Samuel (1 Chronicles 6:33–34).    
Psalm 88 was credited to Heman.

Eleven psalms were credited to Koralites.
