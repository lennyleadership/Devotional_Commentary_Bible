19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.  
19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.  
19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;  
19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.  
19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:  

19:6 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.  
19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.  
19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.  
19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.  
19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,  

19:11 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.  
19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:  
19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.  
19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.  
19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.  

19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.  
19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.  
19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.  
19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.  
19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.  

19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.  
19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.  
19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.  
19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.  
19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

19:1 以色列人出埃及地以后、满了三个月的那一天、就来到西乃的旷野。  
19:2 他们离了利非订来到西乃的旷野、就在那里的山下安营。  
19:3 摩西到　神那里、耶和华从山上呼唤他说、你要这样告诉雅各家、晓谕以色列人、说、
19:4 我向埃及人所行的事、你们都看见了、且看见我如鹰将你们背在翅膀上、带来归我。  
19:5 如今你们若实在听从我的话、遵守我的约、就要在万民中作属我的子民、因为全地都是我的。  

19:6 你们要归我作祭司的国度、为圣洁的国民。  这些话你要告诉以色列人。  
19:7 摩西去召了民间的长老来、将耶和华所吩咐他的话、都在他们面前陈明。  
19:8 百姓都同声回答说、凡耶和华所说的、我们都要遵行。  摩西就将百姓的话回复耶和华。  
19:9 耶和华对摩西说、我要在密云中临到你那里、叫百姓在我与你说话的时候可以听见、也可以永远信你了。  于是摩西将百姓的话奏告耶和华。  
19:10 耶和华又对摩西说、你往百姓那里去、叫他们今天明天自洁、又叫他们洗衣服。  

19:11 到第三天要预备好了、因为第三天耶和华要在众百姓眼前降临在西乃山上。  
19:12 你要在山的四围给百姓定界限、说、你们当谨慎、不可上山去、也不可摸山的边界、凡摸这山的、必要治死他。  
19:13 不可用手摸他、必用石头打死、或用箭射透、无论是人、是牲畜、都不得活。  到角声拖长的时候、他们才可到山根来。  
19:14 摩西下山往百姓那里去、叫他们自洁、他们就洗衣服。  
19:15 他对百姓说、到第三天要预备好了、不可亲近女人。  

19:16 到了第三天早晨、在山上有雷轰、闪电、和密云。  并且角声甚大。  营中的百姓尽都发颤。  
19:17 摩西率领百姓出营迎接　神、都站在山下。  
19:18 西乃全山冒烟、因为耶和华在火中降于山上、山的烟气上腾、如烧窑一般。  遍山大大的震动。  
19:19 角声渐渐的高而又高、摩西就说话、　神有声音答应他。  
19:20 耶和华降临在西乃山顶上、耶和华召摩西上山顶、摩西就上去。  

19:21 耶和华对摩西说、你下去嘱咐百姓、不可闯过来到我面前观看、恐怕他们有多人死亡。  
19:22 又叫亲近我的祭司自洁、恐怕我忽然出来击杀他们。  
19:23 摩西对耶和华说、百姓不能上西乃山、因为你已经嘱咐我们说、要在山的四围定界限、叫山成圣。  
19:24 耶和华对他说、下去吧、你要和亚伦一同上来、只是祭司和百姓不可闯过来上到我面前、恐怕我忽然出来击杀他们。  
19:25 于是摩西下到百姓那里告诉他们。
