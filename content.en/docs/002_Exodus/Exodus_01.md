1:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.  
1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,  
1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,  
1:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.  
1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.  

1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.  
1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.  
1:8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.  
1:9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:  
1:10 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.  

1:11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.  
1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.  
1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:  
1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.  
1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:  

1:16 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.  
1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.  
1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?  
1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.  
1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.  

1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.  
1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

1:1 以色列的众子、各带家眷和雅各一同来到埃及、他们的名字记在下面。  
1:2 有流便、西缅、利未、犹大、
1:3 以萨迦、西布伦、便雅悯、
1:4 但、拿弗他利、迦得、亚设。  
1:5 凡从雅各而生的、共有七十人。  约瑟已经在埃及。  

1:6 约瑟和他的弟兄、并那一代的人都死了。  
1:7 以色列人生养众多并且繁茂、极其强盛、满了那地。  
1:8 有不认识约瑟的新王起来、治理埃及。  
1:9 对他的百姓说、看哪、这以色列民比我们还多、又比我们强盛。  
1:10 来吧我们不如用巧计待他们、恐怕他们多起来、日后若遇甚么争战的事、就连合我们的仇敌攻击我们、离开这地去了。  

1:11 于是埃及人派督工的辖制他们、加重担苦害他们。  他们为法老建造两座积货城、就是比东、和兰塞。  
1:12 只是越发苦害他们、他们越发多起来、越发蔓延。  埃及人就因以色列人愁烦。  
1:13 埃及人严严的使以色列人作工。  
1:14 使他们因作苦工觉得命苦、无论是和泥、是做砖、是作田间各样的工、在一切的工上都严严的待他们。  
1:15 有希伯来的两个收生婆、一名施弗拉、一名普阿。  埃及王对他们说、

1:16 你们为希伯来妇人收生、看他们临盆的时候、若是男孩、就把他杀了、若是女孩、就留他存活。  
1:17 但是收生婆敬畏　神、不照埃及王的吩咐行、竟存留男孩的性命。  
1:18 埃及王召了收生婆来、说、你们为甚么作这事、存留男孩的性命呢。  
1:19 收生婆对法老说、因为希伯来妇人与埃及妇人不同、希伯来妇人本是健壮的、〔原文作活泼的〕收生婆还没有到、他们已经生产了。  
1:20 　神厚待收生婆。  以色列人多起来、极其强盛。  

1:21 收生婆因为敬畏　神、　神便叫他们成立家室。  
1:22 法老吩咐他的众民说、以色列人所生的男孩、你们都要丢在河里、一切的女孩、你们要存留他的性命。
