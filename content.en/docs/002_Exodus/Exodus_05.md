5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.  
5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.  
5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.  
5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.  
5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.  

5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,  
5:7 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.  
5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.  
5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.  
5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.  

5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.  
5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.  
5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.  
5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?  
5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?  

5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.  
5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.  
5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.  
5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.  
5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:  

5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.  
5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?  
5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

5:1 后来摩西亚伦去对法老说、耶和华以色列的　神这样说、容我的百姓去、在旷野向我守节。  
5:2 法老说、耶和华是谁、使我听他的话、容以色列人去呢、我不认识耶和华、也不容以色列人去。  
5:3 他们说、希伯来人的　神遇见了我们、求你容我们往旷野去、走三天的路程、祭祀耶和华我们的　神、免得他用瘟疫、刀兵、攻击我们。  
5:4 埃及王对他们说、摩西亚伦你们为甚么叫百姓旷工呢。  你们去担你们的担子吧。  
5:5 又说、看哪、这地的以色列人、如今众多、你们竟叫他们歇下担子。  

5:6 当天法老吩咐督工的和官长说、
5:7 你们不可照常把草给百姓作砖、叫他们自己去捡草。  
5:8 他们素常作砖的数目、你们仍旧向他们要、一点不可减少、因为他们是懒惰的、所以呼求说、容我们去祭祀我们的　神。  
5:9 你们要把更重的工夫加在这些人身上、叫他们劳碌、不听虚谎的言语。  
5:10 督工的和官长出来对百姓说、法老这样说、我不给你们草。  

5:11 你们自己在那里能找草、就往那里去找吧、但你们的工一点不可减少。  
5:12 于是百姓散在埃及遍地、捡碎稓当作草。  
5:13 督工的催着说、你们一天当完一天的工、与先前有草一样。  
5:14 法老督工的责打他所派以色列人的官长说、你们昨天今天为甚么没有照向来的数目作砖、完你们的工作呢。  
5:15 以色列人的官长就来哀求法老说、为甚么这样待你的仆人。  

5:16 督工的不把草给仆人、并且对我们说、作砖吧。  看哪、你仆人挨了打、其实是你百姓的错。  
5:17 但法老说、你们是懒惰的、你们是懒惰的、所以说、容我们去祭祀耶和华。  
5:18 现在你们去作工吧、草是不给你们的、砖却要如数交纳。  
5:19 以色列人的官长听说、你们每天作砖的工作一点不可减少、就知道是遭遇祸患了。  
5:20 他们离了法老出来、正遇见摩西亚伦站在对面、

5:21 就向他们说、愿耶和华鉴察你们、施行判断、因你们使我们在法老和他臣仆面前有了臭名、把刀递在他们手中杀我们。  
5:22 摩西回到耶和华那里说、主阿、你为甚么苦待这百姓呢、为甚么打发我去呢、
5:23 自从我去见法老奉你的名说话、他就苦待这百姓、你一点也没有拯救他们。
