10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:  
10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.  
10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.  
10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:  
10:5 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:  

10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.  
10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  
10:8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  
10:9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.  
10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.  

10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.  
10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.  
10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.  
10:14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.  
10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.  

10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.  
10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.  
10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.  
10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.  
10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.  

10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.  
10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:  
10:23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.  
10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.  
10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.  

10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.  
10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.  
10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.  
10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.

10:1 耶和华对摩西说、你进去见法老、我使他和他臣仆的心刚硬、为要在他们中间显我这些神迹。  
10:2 并要叫你将我向埃及人所作的事、和在他们中间所行的神迹、传于你儿子和你孙子的耳中、好叫你们知道我是耶和华。  
10:3 摩西亚伦就进去见法老、对他说、耶和华希伯来人的　神、这样说、你在我面前不肯自卑、要到几时呢、容我的百姓去、好事奉我。  
10:4 你若不肯容我的百姓去、明天我要使蝗虫进入你的境内、
10:5 遮满地面、甚至看不见地、并且吃那冰雹所剩的、和田间所长的一切树木。  

10:6 你的宫殿和你众臣仆的房屋、并一切埃及人的房屋、都要被蝗虫占满了、自从你祖宗和你祖宗的祖宗在世以来、直到今日、没有见过这样的灾。  摩西就转身离开法老出去。  
10:7 法老的臣仆对法老说、这人为我们的网罗、要到几时呢、容这些人去、事奉耶和华他们的　神吧。  埃及已经败坏了、你还不知道么。  
10:8 于是摩西亚伦被召回来见法老、法老对他们说、你们去事奉耶和华你们的　神、但那要去的是谁呢。  
10:9 摩西说、我们要和我们老的少的、儿子女儿同去、且把羊群牛群一同带去、因为我们务要向耶和华守节。  
10:10 法老对他们说、我容你们和你们妇人孩子去的时候、耶和华与你们同在吧。  你们要谨慎、因为有祸在你们眼前、〔或作你们存着恶意〕

10:11 不可都去、你们这壮年人去事奉耶和华吧、因为这是你们所求的。  于是把他们从法老面前撵出去。  
10:12 耶和华对摩西说、你向埃及地伸杖、使蝗虫到埃及地上来、吃地上一切的菜蔬、就是冰雹所剩的。  
10:13 摩西就向埃及地伸杖、那一昼一夜、耶和华使东风刮在埃及地上、到了早晨、东风把蝗虫刮了来。  
10:14 蝗虫上来、落在埃及的四境、甚是利害、以前没有这样的、以后也必没有。  
10:15 因为这蝗虫遮满地面、甚至地都黑暗了、又吃地上一切的菜蔬、和冰雹所剩树上的果子。  埃及遍地、无论是树木、是田间的菜蔬、连一点青的也没有留下。  

10:16 于是法老急忙召了摩西亚伦来、说、我得罪耶和华你们的　神、又得罪了你们。  
10:17 现在求你、只这一次、饶恕我的罪、求耶和华你们的　神、使我脱离这一次的死亡。  
10:18 摩西就离开法老去求耶和华。  
10:19 耶和华转了极大的西风、把蝗虫刮起、吹入红海、在埃及的四境连一个也没有留下。  
10:20 但耶和华使法老的心刚硬、不容以色列人去。  

10:21 耶和华对摩西说、你向天伸杖、使埃及地黑暗、这黑暗似乎摸得着。  
10:22 摩西向天伸杖、埃及遍地就乌黑了三天。  
10:23 三天之久、人不能相见、谁也不敢起来离开本处、惟有以色列人家中都有亮光。  
10:24 法老就召摩西来、说、你们去事奉耶和华、只是你们的羊群牛群要留下、你们的妇人孩子可以和你们同去。  
10:25 摩西说、你总要把祭物和燔祭牲交给我们、使我们可以祭祀耶和华我们的　神。  

10:26 我们的牲畜也要带去、连一蹄也不留下、因为我们要从其中取出来、事奉耶和华我们的　神。  我们未到那里、还不知道用甚么事奉耶和华。  
10:27 但耶和华使法老的心刚硬、不肯容他们去。  
10:28 法老对摩西说、你离开我去吧、你要小心、不要再见我的面、因为你见我面的那日、你就必死。  
10:29 摩西说、你说得好、我必不再见你的面了。
