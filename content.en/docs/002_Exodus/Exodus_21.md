21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.  
21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.  
21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.  
21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.  
21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:  

21:6 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.  
21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.  
21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.  
21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.  
21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.  

21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.  
21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.  
21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.  
21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.  
21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.  

21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.  
21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.  
21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:  
21:19 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.  
21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.  

21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.  
21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  
21:23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,  
21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,  
21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.  

21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.  
21:27 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.  
21:28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.  
21:29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.  
21:30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.  

21:31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.  
21:32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.  
21:33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;  
21:34 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.  
21:35 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.  

21:36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.

21:1 你在百姓面前所要立的典章是这样。  
21:2 你若买希伯来人作奴仆、他必服事你六年、第七年他可以自由、白白地出去。  
21:3 他若孤身来、就可以孤身去。  他若有妻、他的妻就可以同他出去。  
21:4 他主人若给他妻子、妻子给他生了儿子、或女儿、妻子和儿女要归主人、他要独自出去。  
21:5 倘或奴仆明说、我爱我的主人、和我的妻子儿女、不愿意自由出去。  

21:6 他的主人就要带他到审判官那里、〔审判官或作　神下同〕又要带他到门前、靠近门框、用锥子穿他的耳朵、他就永远服事主人。  
21:7 人若卖女儿作婢女、婢女不可像男仆那样出去。  
21:8 主人选定他归自己、若不喜欢他、就要许他赎身。  主人既然用诡诈待他、就没有权柄卖给外邦人。  
21:9 主人若选定他给自己的儿子、就当待他如同女儿。  
21:10 若另娶一个、那女子的吃食、衣服、并好合的事、仍不可减少。  

21:11 若不向他行这三样、他就可以不用钱赎、白白的出去。  
21:12 打人以致打死的、必要把他治死。  
21:13 人若不是埋伏着杀人、乃是　神交在他手中、我就设下一个地方、他可以往那里逃跑。  
21:14 人若任意用诡计杀了他的邻舍、就是逃到我的坛那里、也当捉去把他治死。  
21:15 打父母的、必要把他治死。  

21:16 拐带人口、或是把人卖了、或是留在他手下、必要把他治死。  
21:17 咒骂父母的、必要把他治死。  
21:18 人若彼此相争、这个用石头或是拳头打那个、尚且不至于死、不过躺卧在床、
21:19 若再能起来扶杖而出、那打他的可算无罪、但要将他耽误的工夫用钱赔补、并要将他全然医好。  
21:20 人若用棍子打奴仆或婢女、立时死在他的手下、他必要受刑。  

21:21 若过一两天才死、就可以不受刑、因为是用钱买的。  
21:22 人若彼此争斗、伤害有孕的妇人、甚至坠胎、随后却无别害、那伤害他的总要按妇人的丈夫所要的、照审判官所断的受罚。  
21:23 若有别害、就要以命偿命、
21:24 以眼还眼、以牙还牙、以手还手、以脚还脚、
21:25 以烙还烙、以伤还伤、以打还打。  

21:26 人若打坏了他奴仆或是婢女的一只眼、就要因他的眼放他去得以自由。  
21:27 若打掉了他奴仆或是婢女的一个牙、就要因他的牙放他去得以自由。  
21:28 牛若触死男人、或是女人、总要用石头打死那牛、却不可吃他的肉。  牛的主人可算无罪。  
21:29 倘若那牛素来是触人的、有人报告了牛主、他竟不把牛拴着、以致把男人或是女人触死、就要用石头打死那牛、牛主也必治死。  
21:30 若罚他赎命的价银、他必照所罚的、赎他的命。  

21:31 牛无论触了人的儿子、或是女儿、必照这例办理。  
21:32 牛若触了奴仆、或是婢女、必将银子三十舍客勒给他们的主人、也要用石头把牛打死。  
21:33 人若敞着井口、或挖井不遮盖、有牛、或驴掉在里头。  
21:34 井主要拿钱赔还本主人。  死牲畜要归自己。  
21:35 这人的牛若伤了那人的牛、以致于死、他们要卖了活牛、平分价值、也要平分死牛。  

21:36 人若知道这牛素来是触人的、主人竟不把牛拴着、他必要以牛还牛、死牛要归自己。
