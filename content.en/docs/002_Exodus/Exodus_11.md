11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.  
11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.  
11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.  
11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:  
11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.  

11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.  
11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.  
11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.  
11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.  
11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.

11:1 耶和华对摩西说、我再使一样的灾殃临到法老和埃及、然后他必容你们离开这地。  他容你们去的时候、总要催逼你们都从这地出去。  
11:2 你要传于百姓的耳中、叫他们男女各人向邻舍要金器银器。  
11:3 耶和华叫百姓在埃及人眼前蒙恩、并且摩西在埃及地法老臣仆、和百姓的眼中、看为极大。  
11:4 摩西说、耶和华这样说、约到半夜我必出去巡行埃及遍地、
11:5 凡在埃及地、从坐宝座的法老、直到磨子后的婢女所有的长子、以及一切头生的牲畜、都必死。  

11:6 埃及遍地必有大哀号、从前没有这样的、后来也必没有。  
11:7 至于以色列中、无论是人是牲畜、连狗也不敢向他们摇舌、好叫你们知道耶和华是将埃及人和以色列人分别出来。  
11:8 你这一切臣仆都要俯伏来见我、说、求你和跟从你的百姓都出去、然后我要出去。  于是摩西气忿忿地离开法老出去了。  
11:9 耶和华对摩西说、法老必不听你们、使我的奇事在埃及地多起来。  
11:10 摩西亚伦在法老面前行了这一切奇事、耶和华使法老的心刚硬、不容以色列人出离他的地。
