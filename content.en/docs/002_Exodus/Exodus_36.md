36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.  
36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:  
36:3 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.  
36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;  
36:5 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.  

36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.  
36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.  
36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.  
36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.  
36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.  

36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.  
36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.  
36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.  
36:14 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.  
36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.  

36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.  
36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.  
36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.  
36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.  
36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.  

36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.  
36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.  
36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:  
36:24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.  
36:25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,  

36:26 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.  
36:27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.  
36:28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.  
36:29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.  
36:30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.  

36:31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,  
36:32 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.  
36:33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.  
36:34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.  
36:35 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.  

36:36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.  
36:37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;  
36:38 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.

36:1 比撒列和亚何利亚伯、并一切心里有智慧的、就是蒙耶和华赐智慧聪明、叫他知道作圣所各样使用之工的、都要照耶和华所吩咐的作工。  
36:2 凡耶和华赐他心里有智慧、而且受感前来作这工的、摩西把他们和比撒列、并亚何利亚伯、一同召来。  
36:3 这些人就从摩西收了以色列人为作圣所、并圣所使用之工所拿来的礼物。百姓每早晨、还把甘心献的礼物拿来。  
36:4 凡作圣所一切工的智慧人、各都离开他所作的工、
36:5 来对摩西说、百姓为耶和华吩咐使用之工所拿来的、富富有余。  

36:6 摩西传命、他们就在全营中宣告说、无论男女、不必再为圣所拿甚么礼物来。这样才拦住百姓不再拿礼物来。  
36:7 因为他们所有的材料、够作一切当作的物、而且有余。  
36:8 他们中间凡心里有智慧作工的、用十幅幔子作帐幕。这幔子是比撒列用捻的细麻、和蓝色紫色朱红色线制造的、并用巧匠的手工绣上基路伯。  
36:9 每幅幔子长二十八肘、宽四肘。都是一样的尺寸。  
36:10 他使这五幅幔子、幅幅相连、又使那五幅幔子、幅幅相连。  

36:11 在这相连的幔子末幅边上、作蓝色的钮扣、在那相连的幔子末幅边上、也照样作。  
36:12 在这相连的幔子上、作五十个钮扣、在那相连的幔子上、也作五十个钮扣、都是两两相对。  
36:13 又作五十个金钩、使幔子相连。  这才成了一个帐幕。

36:19 并用染红的公羊皮作罩棚的盖、再用海狗皮作一层罩棚上的顶盖。  
36:20 他用皂荚木作帐幕的竖板。  

36:21 每块长十肘、宽一肘半。  
36:22 每块有两榫相对、帐幕一切的板都是这样作。  
36:23 帐幕的南面、作板二十块。  
36:24 在这二十块板底下、又作四十个带卯的银座、两卯接这块板上的两榫、两卯接那块板上的两榫。  
36:25 帐幕的第二面、就是北面、也作板二十块、

36:26 和带卯的银座四十个。这板底下有两卯、那板底下也有两卯。  
36:27 帐幕的后面、就是西面、作板六块。  
36:28 帐幕后面的拐角、作板两块。  
36:29 板的下半截是双的、上半截是整的、直到第一个环子、在帐幕的两个拐角上、都是这样作。  
36:30 有八块板、和十六个带卯的银座。每块板底下有两卯。  

36:31 他用皂荚木作闩。为帐幕这面的板作五闩、
36:32 为帐幕那面的板作五闩。又为帐幕后面的板作五闩。  
36:33 使板腰间的中闩、从这一头通到那一头。  
36:34 用金子将板包裹。又作板上的金环套闩。闩也用金子包裹。  
36:35 他用蓝色紫色朱红色线、和捻的细麻织幔子。以巧匠的手工绣上基路伯。  

36:36 为幔子作四根皂荚木柱子、用金包裹。柱子上有金钩。又为柱子铸了四个带卯的银座。  
36:37 拿蓝色紫色朱红色线、和捻的细麻、用绣花的手工织帐幕的门帘。  
36:38 又为帘子作五根柱子、和柱子上的钩子、用金子把柱顶、和柱子上的杆子包裹。柱子有五个带卯的座、是铜的。
