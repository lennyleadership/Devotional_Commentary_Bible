11:1 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.  
11:2 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
11:3 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.  
11:4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but <b>for</b> the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified <b>thereby</b>.  
11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.  

11:6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.  
11:7 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.  
11:8 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?  
11:9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.  
11:10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.  

11:11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.  
11:12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.  
11:13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.  
11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.  
11:15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.  

11:16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.  
11:17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.  
11:18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:  
11:19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.  
11:20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.  

11:21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  
11:22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.  
11:23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.  
11:24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.  
11:25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:  

11:26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?  
11:27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.  
11:28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.  
11:29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.  
11:30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.  

11:31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.  
11:32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  
11:33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
11:34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.  
11:35 Jesus wept.  

11:36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
11:37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?  
11:38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.  
11:39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.  
11:40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?  

11:41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.  
11:42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.  
11:43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.  
11:44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.  
11:45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.  

11:46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.  
11:47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.  
11:48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.  
11:49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
11:50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.  

11:51 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
11:52 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.  
11:53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.  
11:54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.  
11:55 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.  

11:56 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?  
11:57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.

11:1 有一个患病的人、名叫拉撒路、住在伯大尼、就是马利亚和他姐姐马大的村庄。  
11:2 这马利亚就是那用香膏抹主、又用头发擦他脚的。患病的拉撒路是他的兄弟。  
11:3 他姊妹两个就打发人去见耶稣说、主阿、你所爱的人病了。  
11:4 耶稣听见就说、这病不至于死、乃是为　神的荣耀、叫　神的儿子因此得荣耀。<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">功课一：耶稣行神迹的动机不是为自己当下的好处。他可以饱受饥饿，而不把石头变成面包。中文里没有“荣耀”这样的词，属于舶来品。对应的中文词语是“脸上有光彩！<br>功课二：公开承认他是神的儿子。”</span>  
11:5 耶稣素来爱马大、和他妹子、并拉撒路。  

11:6 听见拉撒路病了、就在所居之地、仍住了两天。  
11:7 然后对门徒说、我们再往犹太去吧。<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">耶稣和门徒住在约旦河，当初施洗约翰给人施洗的地方。耶稣带着门徒从那里去伯大尼，然后没有直接上耶路撒冷，而是去到靠近旷野的城，名叫以法莲。</span>  
11:8 门徒说、拉比、犹太人近来要拿石头打你、你还往那里去么。  
11:9 耶稣回答说、白日不是有十二小时么。人在白日走路、就不至跌倒、因为看见<b>这世上的光</b>。  
11:10 若在黑夜走路、就必跌倒、因为他没有光。  

11:11 耶稣说了这话、随后对他们说、我们的朋友拉撒路睡了、我去叫醒他。  
11:12 门徒说、主阿、他若睡了、就必好了。  
11:13 耶稣这话是指着他死说的。他们却以为是说照常睡了。  
11:14 耶稣就明明的告诉他们说、拉撒路死了。  
11:15 我没有在那里就欢喜、这是为你们的缘故、好叫你们相信。如今我们可以往他那里去吧。  

11:16 多马、又称为低土马、就对那同作门徒的说、我们也去和他同死吧。  
11:17 耶稣到了、就知道拉撒路在坟墓里、已经四天了。  
11:18 伯大尼离耶路撒冷不远、约有六里路。  
11:19 有好些犹太人来看马大和马利亚、要为他们的兄弟安慰他们。  
11:20 马大听见耶稣来了、就出去迎接他。马利亚却仍然坐在家里。  

11:21 马大对耶稣说、主阿、你若早在这里、我兄弟必不死。  
11:22 就是现在、我也知道、你无论向　神求甚么、　神也必赐给你。  
11:23 耶稣说、你兄弟必然复活。  
11:24 马大说、我知道在末日复活的时候、他必复活。  
11:25 耶稣对他说、复活在我、生命也在我。信我的人、虽然死了、也必复活。  

11:26 凡活着信我的人、必永远不死。你信这话么。  
11:27 马大说、主阿、是的。我信你是基督、是　神的儿子、就是那要临到世界的。  
11:28 马大说了这话、就回去暗暗的叫他妹子马利亚说、夫子来了、叫你。  
11:29 马利亚听见了、就急忙起来、到耶稣那里去。  
11:30 那时、耶稣还没有进村子、仍在马大迎接他的地方。  

11:31 那些同马利亚在家里安慰他的犹太人、见他急忙起来出去、就跟着他。以为他要往坟墓那里去哭。  
11:32 马利亚到了耶稣那里、看见他、就俯伏在他脚前、说、主阿、你若早在这里、我兄弟必不死。  
11:33 耶稣看见他哭、并看见与他同来的犹太人也哭、就心里悲叹、又甚忧愁。、  
11:34 便说、你们把他安放在那里。他们回答说、请主来看。  
11:35 耶稣哭了。  

11:36 犹太人就说、你看他爱这人是何等恳切。  
11:37 其中有人说、他既然开了瞎子的眼睛、岂不能叫这人不死么。  
11:38 耶稣又心里悲叹、来到坟墓前。那坟墓是个洞、有一块石头挡着。  
11:39 耶稣说、你们把石头挪开。那死人的姐姐马大对他说、主阿、他现在必是臭了、因为他死了已经四天了。  
11:40 耶稣说、我不是对你说过、你若信、就必看见　神的荣耀么。  

11:41 他们就把石头挪开。耶稣举目望天说、父阿、我感谢你、因为你已经听我。  
11:42 我也知道你常听我、但我说这话、是为周围站着的众人、叫他们信是你差了我来。  
11:43 说了这话、就大声呼叫说、拉撒路出来。  
11:44 那死人就出来了、手脚裹着布、脸上包着手巾。耶稣对他们说、解开、叫他走。  
11:45 那些来看马利亚的犹太人、见了耶稣所作的事、就多有信他的。  

11:46 但其中也有去见法利赛人的、将耶稣所作的事告诉他们。  
11:47 祭司长和法利赛人聚集公会、说、这人行好些神迹、我们怎么办呢。  
11:48 若这样由着他、人人都要信他。罗马人也要来夺我们的地土、和我们的百姓。  
11:49 内中有一个人、名叫该亚法、本年作大祭司、对他们说、你们不知道甚么。  
11:50 独不想一个人替百姓死、免得通国灭亡、就是你们的益处。  

11:51 他这话不是出于自己、是因他本年作大祭司、所以预言耶稣将要替这一国死。  
11:52 也不但替这一国死、并要将　神四散的子民、都聚集归一。  
11:53 从那日起他们就商议要杀耶稣。  
11:54 所以耶稣不再显然行在犹太人中间、就离开那里往靠近旷野的地方去。到了一座城、名叫以法莲、就在那里和门徒同住。  
11:55 犹太人的逾越节近了。有许多人从乡下上耶路撒冷去、要在节前洁净自己。  

11:56 他们就寻找耶稣、站在殿里彼此说、你们的意思如何、他不来过节么。  
11:57 那时、祭司长和法利赛人早已吩咐说、若有人知道耶稣在那里、就要报明、好去拿他。
