1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  
1:2 The same was in the beginning with God.  
1:3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.  
1:4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.  
1:5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.  

1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.  
1:7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.  
1:8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.  
1:9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.  
1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.  

1:11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.  
1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:  
1:13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.  
1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  
1:15 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.  

1:16 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.  
1:17 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.  
1:18 No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.  
1:19 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?  
1:20 And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.  

1:21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.  
1:22 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  
1:23 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  
1:24 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  
1:25 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  

1:26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
1:27 He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  
1:28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  
1:29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  
1:30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  

1:31 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  
1:32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  
1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  
1:34 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  
1:35 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;

1:36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
1:37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  
1:38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  
1:39 He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.  
1:40 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.  

1:41 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  
1:42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  
1:43 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  
1:44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  
1:45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  

1:46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  
1:47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
1:48 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  
1:49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  
1:50 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  

1:51 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

1:1 太初有道、道与　神同在、道就是　神。  
1:2 这道太初与　神同在。  
1:3 万物是借着他造的。凡被造的、没有一样不是借着他造的。  
1:4 生命在他里头。这生命就是人的光。  
1:5 光照在黑暗里、黑暗却不接受光。  

1:6 有一个人、是从　神那里差来的、名叫约翰。  
1:7 这人来、为要作见证、就是为光作见证、叫众人因他可以信。  
1:8 他不是那光、乃是要为光作见证。  
1:9 那光是真光、照亮一切生在世上的人。  
1:10 他在世界、世界也是借着他造的、世界却不认识他。  

1:11 他到自己的地方来、自己的人倒不接待他。  
1:12 凡接待他的、就是信他名的人、他就赐他们权柄、作　神的儿女。  
1:13 这等人不是从血气生的、不是从情欲生的、也不是从人意生的、乃是从　神生的。  
1:14 道成了肉身、住在我们中间、充充满满的有恩典有真理。我们也见过他的荣光、正是父独生子的荣光。  
1:15 约翰为他作见证、喊着说、这就是我曾说、那在我以后来的、反成了在我以前的。因他本来在我以前。  

1:16 从他丰满的恩典里我们都领受了、而且恩上加恩。  
1:17 律法本是借着摩西传的、恩典和真理、都是由耶稣基督来的。  
1:18 从来没有人看见　神。只有在父怀里的独生子将他表明出来。  
1:19 约翰所作的见证、记在下面。犹太人从耶路撒冷差祭司和利未人到约翰那里、问他说、你是谁。  
1:20 他就明说、并不隐瞒。明说、我不是基督。  

1:21 他们又问他说、这样你是谁呢、是以利亚么。他说、我不是。是那先知么、他回答说、不是。  
1:22 于是他们说、你到底是谁、叫我们好回复差我们来的人。你自己说、你是谁。  
1:23 他说、我就是那在旷野有人声喊着说、修直主的道路、正如先知以赛亚所说的。  
1:24 那些人是法利赛人差来的。〔或作那差来的是法利赛人〕 
1:25 他们就问他说、你既不是基督、不是以利亚、也不是那先知、为甚么施洗呢。  

1:26 约翰回答说、我是用水施洗、但有一位站在你们中间、是你们不认识的、  
1:27 就是那在我以后来的、我给他解鞋带、也不配。  
1:28 这是在约但河外伯大尼、〔有古卷作伯大巴喇〕约翰施洗的地方作的见证。  
1:29 次日、约翰看见耶稣来到他那里、就说、看哪、　神的羔羊、除去〔或作背负〕世人罪孽的。  
1:30 这就是我曾说、有一位在我以后来、反成了在我以前的。因他本来在我以前。  

1:31 我先前不认识他。如今我来用水施洗、为要叫他显明给以色列人。  
1:32 约翰又作见证说、我曾看见圣灵彷彿鸽子、从天降下、住在他的身上。  
1:33 我先前不认识他。只是那差我来用水施洗的、对我说、你看见圣灵降下来、住在谁的身上、谁就是用圣灵施洗的。  
1:34 我看见了、就证明这是　神的儿子。  
1:35 再次日、约翰同两个门徒站在那里。  

1:36 他见耶稣行走、就说、看哪、这是　神的羔羊。  
1:37 两个门徒听见他的话、就跟从了耶稣。  
1:38 耶稣转过身来、看见他们跟着、就问他们说、你们要甚么。他们说、拉比、在那里住。（拉比翻出来、就是夫子。)  
1:39 耶稣说、你们来看。他们就去看他在那里住、这一天便与他同住、那时约有申正了。  
1:40 听见约翰的话、跟从耶稣的那两个人、一个是西门彼得的兄弟安得烈。  

1:41 他先找着自己的哥哥西门、对他说、我们遇见弥赛亚了、（弥赛亚翻出来、就是基督)  
1:42 于是领他去见耶稣。耶稣看着他说、你是约翰的儿子西门、〔约翰马太十六章十七节称约拿〕你要称为矶法。（矶法翻出来、就是彼得。) 
1:43 又次日、耶稣想要往加利利去、遇见腓力、就对他说、来跟从我吧。  
1:44 这腓力是伯赛大人、和安得烈、彼得同城。  
1:45 腓力找着拿但业、对他说、摩西在律法上所写的、和众先知所记的那一位、我们遇见了、就是约瑟的儿子拿撒勒人耶稣。  

1:46 拿但业对他说、拿撒勒还能出甚么好的么。腓力说、你来看。  
1:47 耶稣看见拿但业来、就指着他说、看哪、这是个真以色列人、他心里是没有诡诈的。  
1:48 拿但业对耶稣说、你从那里知道我呢。耶稣回答说、腓力还没有招呼你、你在无花果树底下、我就看见你了。  
1:49 拿但业说、拉比、你是　神的儿子、你是以色列的王。  
1:50 耶稣对他说、因为我说在无花果树底下看见你、你就信么。你将要看见比这更大的事。  

1:51 又说、我实实在在的告诉你们、你们将要看见天开了、　神的使者上去下来在人子身上。
