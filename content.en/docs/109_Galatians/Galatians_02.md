2:1 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.  
2:2 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.  
2:3 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:  
2:4 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:  
2:5 To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">老牧师在刚过去的主日分享了“主再来”。他提到在七八十年代这个话题比较热门，现在鲜有教会提及。他这次籍着这个主题再次勉励大家在来年做好预备。

这个主题如此地重要，以至上帝把这个心意放在犹太婚礼的习俗中。新郎一般在晚上迎娶新娘，新娘和伴娘要做好准备。可能早期的新娘还不知道那个晚上是哪天。耶稣来到世上的时候，籍着这个习俗让后辈知道主一定会再来。我们一定要预备好。

今天早上读到加拉太二:5。CSB和NLT的翻译都是： We wanted to preserve the truth of the gospel message for you. “主再来”的主题如此之重要，我们当传承下去。</span>.  

2:6 But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:  
2:7 But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;
2:8 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)  
2:9 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.  
2:10 Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.  

2:11 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.  
2:12 For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.  
2:13 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.  
2:14 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?  
2:15 We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,  

2:16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.  
2:17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.  
2:18 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.  
2:19 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.  
2:20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.  

2:21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

2:1 过了十四年、我同巴拿巴又上耶路撒冷去、并带着提多同去。  
2:2 我是奉启示上去的、把我在外邦人中所传的福音、对弟兄们陈说。却是背地里对那有名望之人说的。惟恐我现在、或是从前、徒然奔跑。  
2:3 但与我同去的提多、虽是希利尼人、也没有勉强他受割礼。  
2:4 因为有偷着引进来的假弟兄、私下窥探我们在基督耶稣里的自由、要叫我们作奴仆。  
2:5 我们就是一刻的工夫、也没有容让顺服他们、为要叫福音的真理仍存在你们中间。  

2:6 至于那些有名望的、不论他是何等人、都与我无干。　神不以外貌取人。那些有名望的、并没有加增我甚么。  
2:7 反倒看见了主托我传福音给那未受割礼的人、正如托彼得传福音给那受割礼的人。  
2:8 （那感动彼得、叫他为受割礼之人作使徒的、也感动我、叫我为外邦人作使徒)
2:9 又知道所赐给我的恩典、那称为教会柱石的雅各、矶法、约翰、就向我和巴拿巴用右手行相交之礼、叫我们往外邦人那里去、他们往受割礼的人那里去。  
2:10 只是愿意我们记念穷人。这也是我本来热心去行的。  

2:11 后来矶法到了安提阿、因他有可责之处、我就当面抵挡他。  
2:12 从雅各那里来的人、未到以先、他和外邦人一同吃饭。及至他们来到、他因怕奉割礼的人、就退去与外邦人隔开了。  
2:13 其余的犹太人、也都随着他装假。甚至连巴拿巴也随伙装假。  
2:14 但我一看见他们行的不正、与福音的真理不合、就在众人面前对矶法说、你既是犹太人、若随外邦人行事、不随犹太人行事、怎么还勉强外邦人随犹太人呢。  
2:15 我们这生来的犹太人、不是外邦的罪人、

2:16 既知道人称义、不是因行律法、乃是因信耶稣基督、连我们也信了基督耶稣、使我们因信基督称义、不因行律法称义。因为凡有血气的、没有一人因行律法称义。  
2:17 我们若求在基督里称义、却仍旧是罪人、难道基督是叫人犯罪的么。断乎不是。  
2:18 我素来所拆毁的、若重新建造、这就证明自己是犯罪的人。  
2:19 我因律法、就向律法死了、叫我可以向　神活着。  
2:20 我已经与基督同钉十字架。现在活着的、不再是我、乃是基督在我里面活着。并且我如今在肉身活着、是因信　神的儿子而活、他是爱我、为我舍己。  

2:21 我不废掉　神的恩。义若是借着律法得的、基督就是徒然死了。
