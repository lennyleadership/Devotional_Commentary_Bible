6:1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.  
6:2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.  
6:3 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.  
6:4 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.  
6:5 For every man shall bear his own burden.  

6:6 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.  
6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Psalm 50:21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.</span>  
6:8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.  
6:9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.  
6:10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.  

6:11 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.  
6:12 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.  
6:13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.  
6:14 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.  
6:15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.  

6:16 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.  
6:17 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.  
6:18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

6:1 弟兄们、若有人偶然被过犯所胜、你们属灵的人、就当用温柔的心、把他挽回过来。又当自己小心、恐怕也被引诱。  
6:2 你们各人的重担要互相担当、如此、就完全了基督的律法。  
6:3 人若无有、自己还以为有、就是自欺了。  
6:4 各人应当察验自己的行为、这样、他所夸的就专在自己、不在别人了。  
6:5 因为各人必担当自己的担子。  

6:6 在道理上受教的、当把一切需用的供给施教的人。  
6:7 不要自欺、　神是轻慢不得的。人种的是甚么、收的也是甚么。  
6:8 顺着情欲撒种的、必从情欲收败坏。顺着圣灵撒种的、必从圣灵收永生。  
6:9 我们行善、不可丧志。若不灰心、到了时候、就要收成。  
6:10 所以有了机会、就当向众人行善。向信徒一家的人更当这样。  

6:11 请看我亲手写给你们的字、是何等的大呢。  
6:12 凡希图外貌体面的人、都勉强你们受割礼。无非是怕自己为基督的十字架受逼迫。  
6:13 他们那些受割礼的、连自己也不守律法。他们愿意你们受割礼、不过要借着你们的肉体夸口。  
6:14 但我断不以别的夸口、只夸我们主耶稣基督的十字架。因这十字架、就我而论、世界已经钉在十字架上。就世界而论、我已经钉在十字架上。  
6:15 受割礼不受割礼、都无关紧要、要紧的就是作新造的人。  

6:16 凡照此理而行的、愿平安怜悯加给他们、和　神的以色列民。  
6:17 从今以后、人都不要搅扰我。因为我身上带着耶稣的印记。  
6:18 弟兄们、愿我主耶稣基督的恩常在你们心里。阿们。

A hymn was written from verse 14.  

1 When I survey the wondrous cross
<br>on which the Prince of glory died,
<br>my <u class = "red">richest</u> gain I count but loss,
<br>and pour contempt on all my <u class = "red">pride</u>. <a class = "marginnote">contempt: The state or act of contemning; the feeling or <br>attitude of regarding someone or something as inferior, base, or worthless; scorn, disdain.</a>

2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
<br>save in the death of Christ, my God!
<br>All the vain things that charm me most,
<br>I <u class = "red">sacrifice them</u> through his blood.

3 See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
<br>sorrow and <u class = "red">love</u> flow mingled down.
<br>Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
<br>or thorns compose so rich a crown?

4 Were the whole realm of nature mine,
<br>that were a present far too small.
<br><u class = "red">Love</u> so amazing, so divine,
<br>demands my soul, my life, my all.

當我思量奇妙十架  
榮耀之主在上懸掛，  
從前名利今當糞土，  
昔日所誇今覺鄙下。  

求主禁我別有所誇，  
但誇救主釘死十架！  
前所愛慕虛幻榮華，  
為主寶血我今撇下。

試看其頭、其足、其手，  
慈愛憂愁和血並流！  
如此愛、憂自古焉有？  
荊棘反成榮耀冕旒。

若得萬物獻主為報，  
難償深恩仍嫌微少；  
主愛如此神聖奇妙，  
願獻我魂、我命、我的全部！  
阿門！

--

每逢思念奇妙十架，  
荣耀救主在上悬挂，  
从前名利，富足，矜夸，  
我看如土，完全撇下。

求主禁我别有所夸，  
只夸救主舍身十架，  
基督为我献身流血，  
我愿舍尽虚空荣华。

试看祂头，祂足，祂手，  
慈爱忧伤和血并流，  
从前可曾爱忧交织？  
荆棘可曾化作冕旒？

宇宙万物若归我有，  
尽献所有何足报恩，  
神圣大爱奇妙难测，  
愿献我命，我心，我身。
