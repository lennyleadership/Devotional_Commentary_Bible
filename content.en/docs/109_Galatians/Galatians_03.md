3:1 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?  
3:2 This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  
3:3 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?  
3:4 Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.  
3:5 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  

3:6 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.  
3:7 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.  
3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.  
3:9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.  
3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.  

3:11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.  
3:12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.  
3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:  
3:14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.  
3:15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.  

3:16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.  
3:17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.  
3:18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.  
3:19 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.  
3:20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.  

3:21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.  
3:22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.  
3:23 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.  
3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  
3:25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.  

3:26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.  
3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  
3:28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.  
3:29 And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

3:1 无知的加拉太人哪、耶稣基督钉十字架、已经活画在你们眼前、谁又迷惑了你们呢。  
3:2 我只要问你们这一件、你们受了圣灵、是因行律法呢、是因听信福音呢。  
3:3 你们既靠圣灵入门、如今还靠肉身成全么。你们是这样的无知么。  
3:4 你们受苦如此之多、都是徒然的么。难道果真是徒然的么。  
3:5 那赐给你们圣灵、又在你们中间行异能的、是因你们行律法呢、是因你们听信福音呢。  

3:6 正如『亚伯拉罕信　神这就算为他的义。』
3:7 所以你们要知道那以信为本的人、就是亚伯拉罕的子孙。  
3:8 并且圣经既然预先看明、　神要叫外邦人因信称义、就早已传福音给亚伯拉罕、说、『万国都必因你得福。』
3:9 可见那以信为本的人、和有信心的亚伯拉罕一同得福。  
3:10 凡以行律法为本的、都是被咒诅的。因为经上记着、『凡不常照律法书上所记一切之事去行的、就被咒诅。』

3:11 没有一个人靠着律法在　神面前称义、这是明显的。因为经上说、『义人必因信得生。』
3:12 律法原不本乎信、只说、『行这些事的、就必因此活着。』
3:13 基督既为我们受了咒诅、〔受原文作成〕就赎出我们脱离律法的咒诅。因为经上记着、『凡挂在木头上都是被咒诅的。』
3:14 这便叫亚伯拉罕的福、因基督耶稣可以临到外邦人、使我们因信得着所应许的圣灵。  
3:15 弟兄们、我且照着人的常话说、虽然是人的文约、若已经立定了、就没有能废弃或加增的。  

3:16 所应许的原是向亚伯拉罕和他子孙说的。　神并不是说众子孙、指着许多人、乃是说你那一个子孙、指着一个人、就是基督。  
3:17 我是这么说、　神预先所立的约、不能被那四百三十年以后的律法废掉、叫应许归于虚空。  
3:18 因为承受产业、若本乎律法、就不本乎应许。但　神是凭着应许、把产业赐给亚伯拉罕。  
3:19 这样说来、律法是为甚么有的呢。原是为过犯添上的、等候那蒙应许的子孙来到。并且是借天使经中保之手设立的。  
3:20 但中保本不是为一面作的。　神却是一位。  

3:21 这样、律法是与　神的应许反对么。断乎不是。若曾传一个能叫人得生的律法、义就诚然本乎律法了。  
3:22 但圣经把众人都圈在罪里、使所应许的福因信耶稣基督、归给那信的人。  
3:23 但这因信得救的理、还未来以先、我们被看守在律法之下、直圈到那将来的真道显明出来。  
3:24 这样、律法是我们训蒙的师傅、引我们到基督那里、使我们因信称义。  
3:25 但这因信得救的理、既然来到、我们从此就不在师傅的手下了。  

3:26 所以你们因信基督耶稣、都是　神的儿子。  
3:27 你们受洗归入基督的、都是披戴基督了。  
3:28 并不分犹太人、希利尼人、自主的、为奴的、或男或女。因为你们在基督耶稣、里都成为一了。  
3:29 你们既属乎基督、就是亚伯拉罕的后裔、是照着应许承受产业的了。
