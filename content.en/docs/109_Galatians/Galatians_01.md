1:1 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)  
1:2 And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:  
1:3 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,  
1:4 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:  
1:5 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.  

1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:  
1:7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.  
1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.  
1:9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.  
1:10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.  

1:11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.  
1:12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.  
1:13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:  
1:14 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.  
1:15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,  

1:16 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:  
1:17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.  
1:18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.  
1:19 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.  
1:20 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.  

1:21 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
1:22 And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:  
1:23 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.  
1:24 And they glorified God in me.

1:1 作使徒的保罗、（不是由于人、也不是借着人、乃是借着耶稣基督、与叫他从死里复活的父　神)
1:2 和一切与我同在的众弟兄、写信给加拉太的各教会。  
1:3 愿恩惠平安、从父　神与我们的主耶稣基督、归与你们。  
1:4 基督照我们父　神的旨意为我们的罪舍己、要救我们脱离这罪恶的世代。  
1:5 但愿荣耀归于　神直到永永远远。阿们。  

1:6 我希奇你们这么快离开那借着基督之恩召你们的、去从别的福音。  
1:7 那并不是福音、不过有些人搅扰你们、要把基督的福音更改了。  
1:8 但无论是我们、是天上来的使者、若传福音给你们、与我们所传给你们的不同、他就应当被咒诅。  
1:9 我们已经说了、现在又说、若有人传福音给你们、与你们所领受的不同、他就应当被咒诅。  
1:10 我现在是要得人的心呢、还是要得　神的心呢。我岂是讨人的喜欢么。若仍旧讨人的喜欢、我就不是基督的仆人了。  

1:11 弟兄们、我告诉你们、我素来所传的福音、不是出于人的意思。  
1:12 因为我不是从人领受的、也不是人教导我的、乃是从耶稣基督启示来的。  
1:13 你们听见我从前在犹太教中所行的事、怎样极力逼迫残害　神的教会。  
1:14 我又在犹太教中、比我本国许多同岁的人更有长进、为我祖宗的遗传更加热心。  
1:15 然而那把我从母腹里分别出来、又施恩召我的　神、

1:16 既然乐意将他儿子启示在我心里、叫我把他传在外邦人中、我就没有与属血气的人商量、
1:17 也没有上耶路撒冷去、见那些比我先作使徒的。惟独往亚拉伯去。后又回到大马色。  
1:18 过了三年、才上耶路撒冷去见矶法、和他同住了十五天。  
1:19 至于别的使徒、除了主的兄弟雅各、我都没有看见。  
1:20 我写给你们的、不是谎话、这是我在　神面前说的。  

1:21 以后我到了叙利亚和基利家境内。  
1:22 那时、犹太信基督的各教会都没有见过我的面。  
1:23 不过听说、那从前逼迫我们的、现在传扬他原先所残害的真道。  
1:24 他们就为我的缘故、归荣耀给　神。
