19:1 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.  
19:2 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.  
19:3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.  
19:4 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.  
19:5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.<label for="Zacchaeus" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">2022.11.16, LBC, Wed., Christine: Jesus already knew Zacchaeus. <br><br>2023.10.29, LBC, Sun. | topic: Bibical view of wealth and the rich
<br>1) Psalm 139:1-18, Lord, you have searched me and known me.

<br>4) James 5:1-6, warning to the rich
<br>5) Deu 8:5-20, Don't forget God and His words</span>  

19:6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.  
19:7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.  
19:8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.  
19:9 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.  
19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.  

19:11 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.  
19:12 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.<label for="nobleman" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">2022.11.16, LBC, Wed., nobleman is the picture of Jesus</span>     
19:13 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.  
19:14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.  
19:15 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.  

19:16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.<label for="talent" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Use your talent as if God uses it, not with your own strength</span>     
19:17 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.  
19:18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.  
19:19 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.  
19:20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:  

19:21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.  
19:22 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:  
19:23 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?
19:24 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.  
19:25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)

19:26 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.  
19:27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.  
19:28 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.  
19:29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,  
19:30 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.  

19:31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.  
19:32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.  
19:33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?
19:34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.  
19:35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.  

19:36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.  
19:37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;  
19:38 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.  
19:39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.  
19:40 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.  

19:41 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,  
19:42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.  
19:43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,  
19:44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.  
19:45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;  

19:46 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.  
19:47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,  
19:48 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.

19:1 耶稣进了耶利哥、正经过的时候、
19:2 有一个人名叫撒该、作税吏长、是个财主。  
19:3 他要看看耶稣是怎样的人。只因人多、他的身量又矮、所以不得看见。  
19:4 就跑到前头、爬上桑树、要看耶稣、因为耶稣必从那里经过。  
19:5 耶稣到了那里、抬头一看、对他说、撒该、快下来、今天我必住在你家里。  

19:6 他就急忙下来、欢欢喜喜的接待耶稣。  
19:7 众人看见、都私下议论说、他竟到罪人家里去住宿。  
19:8 撒该站着、对主说、主阿、我把所有的一半给穷人。我若讹诈了谁、就还他四倍。  
19:9 耶稣说、今天救恩到了这家、因为他也是亚伯拉罕的子孙。  
19:10 人子来、为要寻找拯救失丧的人。  

19:11 众人正在听见这些话的时候、耶稣因为将近耶路撒冷、又因他们以为　神的国快要显出来、就另设一个比喻说、
19:12 有一个贵胄往远方去、要得国回来。  
19:13 便叫了他的十个仆人来、交给他们十锭银子、〔锭原文作弥拿一弥拿约银十两〕说、你们去作生意、直等我回来。  
19:14 他本国的人却恨他、打发使者随后去说、我们不愿意这个人作我们的王。  
19:15 他既得国回来、就吩咐叫那领银子的仆人来、要知道他们作生意赚了多少。  

19:16 头一个上来说、主阿、你的一锭银子、已经赚了十锭。  
19:17 主人说、好、良善的仆人。你既在最小的事上有忠心、可以有权柄管十座城。  
19:18 第二个来说、主阿、你的一锭银子、已经赚了五锭。  
19:19 主人说、你也可以管五座城。  
19:20 又有一个来说、主阿、看哪、你的一锭银子在这里、我把它包在手巾里存着。  

19:21 我原是怕你、因为你是严厉的人。没有放下的还要去拿、没有种下的还要去收。  
19:22 主人对他说、你这恶仆、我要凭你的口、定你的罪。你既知道我是严厉的人、没有放下的还要去拿、没有种下的还要去收。  
19:23 为甚么不把我的银子交给银行、等我来的时候、连本带利都可以要回来呢。  
19:24 就对旁边站着的人说、夺过他这一锭来、给那有十锭的。  
19:25 他们说、主阿、他已经有十锭了。  

19:26 主人说、我告诉你们、凡有的、还要加给他。没有的、连他所有的、也要夺过来。  
19:27 至于我那些仇敌不要我作他们王的、把他们拉来、在我面前杀了吧。  
19:28 耶稣说完了这话、就在前面走、上耶路撒冷去。  
19:29 将近伯法其和伯大尼、在一座山名叫橄榄山那里。就打发两个门徒、说、
19:30 你们往对面村子里去。进去的时候、必看见一匹驴驹拴在那里、是从来没有人骑过的。可以解开牵来。  

19:31 若有人问为甚么解它、你们就说、主要用他。  
19:32 打发的人去了、所遇见的、正如耶稣所说的。  
19:33 他们解驴驹的时候、主人问他们说、解驴驹作甚么。  
19:34 他们说、主要用他。  
19:35 他们牵到耶稣那里、把自己的衣服搭在上面、扶着耶稣骑上。  

19:36 走的时候、众人把衣服铺在路上。  
19:37 将近耶路撒冷、正下橄榄山的时候、众门徒因所见过的一切异能、都欢乐起来、大声赞美　神、
19:38 说、奉主名来的王、是应当称颂的。在天上有和平、在至高之处有荣光。  
19:39 众人中有几个法利赛人对耶稣说、夫子、责备你的门徒吧。  
19:40 耶稣说、我告诉你们、若是他们闭口不说、这些石头必要呼叫起来。  

19:41 耶稣快到耶路撒冷看见城、就为他哀哭、
19:42 说、巴不得你在这日子、知道关系你平安的事。无奈这事现在是隐藏的、叫你的眼看不出来。  
19:43 因为日子将到、你的仇敌必筑起土垒、周围环绕你、四面困住你、
19:44 并要扫灭你、和你里头的儿女、连一块石头也不留在石头上。因你不知道眷顾你的时候。  
19:45 耶稣进了殿、赶出里头作买卖的人、

19:46 对他们说、经上说、『我的殿、必作祷告的殿。』你们倒使他成为贼窝了。  
19:47 耶稣天天在殿里教训人。祭司长、和文士、与百姓的尊长、都想要杀他。  
19:48 但寻不出法子来、因为百姓都侧耳听他。
