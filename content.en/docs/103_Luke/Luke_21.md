21:1 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.  
21:2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.  
21:3 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:  
21:4 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.  
21:5 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,  

21:6 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.  
21:7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?
21:8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.  
21:9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.  
21:10 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:  

21:11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.  
21:12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.  
21:13 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.  
21:14 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:  
21:15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.  

21:16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.  
21:17 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.  
21:18 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.  
21:19 In your patience possess ye your souls.  
21:20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.  

21:21 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.  
21:22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.  
21:23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.  
21:24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.  
21:25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;  

21:26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.  
21:27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.  
21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.  
21:29 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;  
21:30 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.  

21:31 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.  
21:32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.  
21:33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.  
21:34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.  
21:35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.  

21:36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.  
21:37 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.  
21:38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.

21:1 耶稣抬头观看、见财主把捐项投在库里。  
21:2 又见一个穷寡妇、投了两个小钱。  
21:3 就说、我实在告诉你们。这穷寡妇、所投的比众人还多。  
21:4 因为众人都是自己有余、拿出来投在捐项里。但这寡妇是自己不足、把他一切养生的都投上了。  
21:5 有人谈论圣殿、是用美石和供物妆饰的。  

21:6 耶稣就说、论到你们所看见的这一切、将来日子到了、在这里没有一块石头留在石头上、不被拆毁了。  
21:7 他们问他说、夫子、甚么时候有这事呢。这事将到的时候、有甚么预兆呢。  
21:8 耶稣说、你们要谨慎、不要受迷惑。因为将来有好些人冒我的名来、说、我是基督。又说、时候近了。你们不要跟从他们。  
21:9 你们听见打仗和扰乱的事、不要惊惶。因为这些事必须先有。只是末期不能立时就到。  
21:10 当时耶稣对他们说、民要攻打民、国要攻打国。  

21:11 地要大大震动、多处必有饥荒瘟疫。又有可怕的异象、和大神迹、从天上显现。  
21:12 但这一切的事以先、人要下手拿住你们、逼迫你们、把你们交给会堂、并且收在监里、又为我的名拉你们到君王诸侯面前。  
21:13 但这些事终必为你们的见证。  
21:14 所以你们当立定心意、不要预先思想怎样分诉。  
21:15 因为我必赐你们口才智慧、是你们一切敌人所敌不住、驳不倒的。  

21:16 连你们的父母、弟兄、亲族、朋友、也要把你们交官。你们也有被他们害死的。  
21:17 你们要为我的名、被众人恨恶。  
21:18 然而你们连一根头发、也必不损坏。  
21:19 你们常存忍耐、就必保全灵魂。〔或作必得生命〕
21:20 你们看见耶路撒冷被兵围困、就可知道他。成荒场的日子近了。  

21:21 那时、在犹太的、应当逃到山上。在城里的、应当出来。在乡下的、不要进城。  
21:22 因为这是报应的日子、使经上所写的都得应验。  
21:23 当那些日子、怀孕的和奶孩子的有祸了。因为将有大灾难降在这地方、也有震怒临到这百姓。  
21:24 他们要倒在刀下、又被掳到各国去。耶路撒冷要被外邦人践踏、直到外邦人的日期满了。  
21:25 日月星辰要显出异兆。地上的邦国也有困苦。因海中波浪的响声、就慌慌不定。  

21:26 天势都要震动。人想起那将要临到世界的事、就都吓得魂不附体。  
21:27 那时、他们要看见人子、有能力、有大荣耀、驾云降临。  
21:28 一有这些事、你们就当挺身昂首。因为你们得赎的日子近了。  
21:29 耶稣又设比喻对他们说、你们看无花果树、和各样的树。  
21:30 他发芽的时候、你们一看见自然晓得夏天近了。  

21:31 这样、你们看见这些事渐渐的成就、也该晓得　神的国近了。  
21:32 我实在告诉你们、这世代还没有过去、这些事都要成就。  
21:33 天地要废去、我的话却不能废去。  
21:34 你们要谨慎、恐怕因贪食醉酒并今生的思虑、累住你们的心、那日子就如同网罗忽然临到你们。  
21:35 因为那日子要这样临到全地上一切居住的人。  

21:36 你们要时时儆醒、常常祈求、使你们能逃避这一切要来的事、得以站立在人子面前。  
21:37 耶稣每日在殿里教训人。每夜出城在一座山、名叫橄榄山住宿。  
21:38 众百姓清早上圣殿、到耶稣那里、要听他讲道。

[2022.12.21  ]  
The widow's giving  

Q: Is giving the religious practice?  

Genesis 14:17-20   
First-time law: First time it was mentioned.  

Mark 12:41-44 the attitude of giving generously.  

In OT giving was requirement. Giving was the bibical teaching.  Giving is a response.  Heart condition.  

Depend on God.  

1 John 2:18-23 Antichrist  

Satan, Beasts, and false prophets.  

The widow may sense the eternal life.  

How should we approach prophecies?  
1) not academy way;  
2) with humility.  

Your redemption is near.
