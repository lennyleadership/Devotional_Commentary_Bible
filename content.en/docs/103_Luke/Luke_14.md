14:1 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.  
14:2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.  
14:3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?
14:4 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;  
14:5 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?

14:6 And they could not answer him again to these things.  
14:7 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,  
14:8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;  
14:9 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.  
14:10 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.  

14:11 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.  
14:12 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.  
14:13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:  
14:14 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.  
14:15 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.  

14:16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:  
14:17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.  
14:18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.  
14:19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.  
14:20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.  

14:21 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.  
14:22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.  
14:23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.  
14:24 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.  
14:25 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,  

14:26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.  
14:27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.  
14:28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?
14:29 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,  
14:30 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.  

14:31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
14:32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.  
14:33 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.  
14:34 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
14:35 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

14:1 安息日、耶稣到一个法利赛人的首领家里去吃饭、他们就窥探他。  
14:2 在他面前有一个患水臌的人。  
14:3 耶稣对律法师和法利赛人说、安息日治病、可以不可以。  
14:4 他们却不言语。耶稣就治好那人、叫他走了。  
14:5 便对他们说、你们中间谁有驴或有牛、在安息日掉在井里、不立时拉它上来呢。  

14:6 他们不能对答这话。  
14:7 耶稣见所请的客拣择首位、就用比喻对他们说、  
14:8 你被人请去赴婚姻的筵席、不要坐在首位上。恐怕有比你尊贵的客、被他请来。  
14:9 那请你们的人前来对你说、让座给这一位吧。你就羞羞惭惭的退到末位上去了。  
14:10 你被请的时候、就去坐在末位上、好叫那请你的人来、对你说、朋友、请上坐。那时你在同席的人面前、就有光彩了。  

14:11 因为凡自高的必降为卑。自卑的必升为高。  
14:12 耶稣又对请他的人说、你摆设午饭、或晚饭、不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属、和富足的邻舍。恐怕他们也请你、你就得了报答。  
14:13 你摆设筵席、倒要请那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的、你就有福了。[ 9:1-2]  
14:14 因为他们没有甚么可报答你。到义人复活的时候、你要得着报答。  
14:15 同席的有一人听见这话、就对耶稣说、在　神国里吃饭的有福了。  

14:16 耶稣对他说、有一人摆设大筵席、请了许多客。  
14:17 到了坐席的时候、打发仆人去对所请的人说、请来吧。样样都齐备了。  
14:18 众人一口同音的推辞。头一个说、我买了一块地、必须去看看。请你准我辞了。  
14:19 又有一个说、我买了五对牛、要去试一试。请你准我辞了。  
14:20 又有一个说、我才娶了妻、所以不能去。  

14:21 那仆人回来、把这事都告诉了主人。家主就动怒、对仆人说、快出去到城里大街小巷、领那贫穷的、残废的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的来。  
14:22 仆人说、主阿、你所吩咐的已经办了、还有空座。  
14:23 主人对仆人说、你出去到路上和篱笆那里、勉强人进来、坐满我的屋子。  
14:24 我告诉你们、先前所请的人、没有一个得尝我的筵席。  
14:25 有极多的人和耶稣同行。他转过来对他们说、

14:26 人到我这里来、若不爱我胜过爱自己的父母、妻子、儿女、弟兄、姐妹和自己的性命、就不能作我的门徒。〔爱我胜过爱原文作恨〕<a id="1_ref" href = "#1">[1]</a>&emsp;<a id="2_ref" href = "#2">[2]</a>  
14:27 凡不背着自己十字架跟从我的、也不能作我的门徒。  
14:28 你们那一个要盖一座楼、不先坐下算计花费、能盖成不能呢。  
14:29 恐怕安了地基、不能成功、看见的人都笑话他、  
14:30 说、这个人开了工、却不能完工。  

14:31 或是一个王、出去和别的王打仗、岂不先坐下酌量、能用一万兵、去敌那领二万兵来攻打他的么。  
14:32 若是不能、就趁敌人还远的时候、派使者去求和息的条款。  
14:33 这样、你们无论甚么人、若不撇下一切所有的、就不能作我的门徒。  
14:34 盐本是好的。盐若失了味、可用甚么叫它再咸呢。  
14:35 或用在田里、或堆在粪里、都不合式。只好丢在外面。有耳可听的、就应当听。<a id="3_ref" href = "#3">[3]</a>

<br>Jesus is not an add-on to my life. [MY's comments]  
<br>It is daily decision to follow Christ. [CY's comments]  
<br>There are many half-hearted christian. [KY's comments]
<br>"by comparison"  
<br>Nothing will hold you back.  
<br>Some Christians see it as religion.  
<br>We all were lukewarm. [CY's comments]  
<br>Can't just let everyone in. [CY's comments]    
<br>God is not saying to give you a passport to heaven. [KY's comments]    
<br>Lukewarm is referred to un-believers. [KY's comments]  
<br>He has not grasped the salvation.  His comments is at stake. [KY's comments]  
<br>God wants relationship with us, rather than be interested in the ticket to the heaven. [KY's comments]  
<br>God can't be mocked by our lip service. [KY's comments]<a href="#1_ref">&#8617;</a></p>

<p id="2">[2] 
路加十四章让我看到，上帝爱世人，把福音的好消息先给以色列人，后来是外邦人，不愿意看到世人沉沦。不过谁可以进来天国呢？ 
<br>1）不是每个人对福音有积极的反应。
<br>2）愿意参加的人还得满足条件，是不是愿意放下一切（爱上帝多于爱家人、背十字架）。耶稣讲的很清楚，得计算代价，得想清楚了再来（盖楼、打仗的比喻）。上帝不愿意滥竽充数。  
路加十四章也诠释了腓立比二12说的，我们要“恐惧战兢”完成你们自己得救的事。  

<br>The parables in Luke 14 told me this:  
<br>God love the world, and gave His son.  He firstly gave such good news to Jews, then the gentiles.  However, who can come into the Heaven. 
<br>1) not every one responses to the gospel positively, 
<br>2) whoever wants to come has to meet requirements, such as: 
<br>a) by comparison, love Him more than family members and self, 
<br>b) bear the cross every day, ...  God do not want to make up the number in the Heaven.  
The parables in Luke 14 tell me how I suppose to live out a normal Christian life.  The attitude is also amplified in Philippians 2:12 work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

want to be salt, but don't be salty. Be all in. [KY's comments] 
<br>You want a job, but I don't want to work. [MY's comments]  
<br>Starting point: real, authentic in heart, not luke-warm. [KY's comments]  
<br>Sincerity can be replaced with whole-hearted. [CY's comments]   
<br>take up my cross.  my cross, do I put Him first? (have that in mind)  I have not put Christ first when I firstly believe in Him.  [CY's comments]  
<br>saved, but not bear in fruits. back-sliding(?) [Tony's comments]
<br>Christian who follows, Christian who does not follow the Shepard. [KY's comments]
