2:1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.  
2:2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
2:3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.  
2:4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)
2:5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.  

2:6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.  
2:7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.  
2:8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.  
2:9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.  
2:10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.  

2:11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.  
2:12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.  
2:13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,  
2:14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.  
2:15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.  

2:16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.  
2:17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.  
2:18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.  
2:19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.  
2:20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.  

2:21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.  
2:22 And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;  
2:23 (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
2:24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.  
2:25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.  

2:26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.  
2:27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,  
2:28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,  
2:29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:  
2:30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,  

2:31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;  
2:32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.  
2:33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.  
2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;  
2:35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.  

2:36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;  
2:37 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.  
2:38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.  
2:39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.  
2:40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.  

2:41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.  
2:42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.  
2:43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.  
2:44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.  
2:45 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.  

2:46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.  
2:47 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.  
2:48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.  
2:49 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?
2:50 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.  

2:51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.  
2:52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

2:1 当那些日子、该撒亚古士督有旨意下来、叫天下人民都报名上册。  
2:2 这是居里扭作叙利亚巡抚的时候、头一次行报名上册的事。  
2:3 众人各归各城、报名上册。  
2:4 约瑟也从加利利的拿撒勒城上犹太去、到了大卫的城、名叫伯利恒、因他本是大卫一族一家的人。  
2:5 要和他所聘之妻马利亚、一同报名上册。那时马利亚的身孕已经重了。  

2:6 他们在那里的时候、马利亚的产期到了。  
2:7 就生了头胎的儿子、用布包起来、放在马槽里、因为客店里没有地方。  
2:8 在伯利恒之野地里有牧羊的人、夜间按着更次看守羊群。  
2:9 有主的使者站在他们旁边、主的荣光四面照着他们。牧羊的人就甚惧怕。  
2:10 那天使对他们说、不要惧怕、我报给你们大喜的信息、是关乎万民的。  

2:11 因今天在大卫的城里、为你们生了救主、就是主基督。  
2:12 你们要看见一个婴孩、包着布、卧在马槽里、那就是记号了。  
2:13 忽然有一大队天兵、同那天使赞美　神说、
2:14 在至高之处荣耀归与　神、在地上平安归与他所喜悦的人。〔有古卷作喜悦归与人〕
2:15 众天使离开他们升天去了、牧羊的人彼此说、我们往伯利恒去、看看所成的事、就是主所指示我们的。  

2:16 他们急忙去了、就寻见马利亚和约瑟、又有那婴孩卧在马槽里。  
2:17 既然看见、就把天使论这孩子的话传开了。  
2:18 凡听见的、就诧异牧羊之人对他们所说的话。  
2:19 马利亚却把这一切的事存在心里、反复思想。  
2:20 牧羊的人回去了。因所听见所看见的一切事、正如天使向他们所说的、就归荣耀与　神、赞美他。  

2:21 满了八天、就给孩子行割礼、与他起名叫耶稣、这就是没有成胎以前、天使所起的名。  
2:22 按摩西律法满了洁净的日子、他们带着孩子上耶路撒冷去、要把他献与主。  
2:23 （正如主的律法上所记、『凡头生的男子、必称圣归主。』)
2:24 又要照主的律法上所说、或用一对斑鸠、或用两只雏鸽献祭。  
2:25 在耶路撒冷有一个人名叫西面。这人又公义又虔诚、素常盼望以色列的安慰者来到、又有圣灵在他身上。  

2:26 他得了圣灵的启示、知道自己未死以前、必看见主所立的基督。  
2:27 他受了圣灵的感动、进入圣殿。正遇见耶稣的父母抱着孩子进来、要照律法的规矩办理。  
2:28 西面就用手接过他来、称颂　神说、
2:29 主阿、如今可以照你的话、释放仆人安然去世。  
2:30 因为我的眼睛已经看见你的救恩、

2:31 就是你在万民面前所预备的。  
2:32 是照亮外邦人的光、又是你民以色列的荣耀。  
2:33 孩子的父母、因这论耶稣的话就希奇。  
2:34 西面给他们祝福、又对孩子的母亲马利亚说、这孩子被立、是要叫以色列中许多人跌倒、许多人兴起。又要作毁谤的话柄。叫许多人心里的意念显露出来。你自己的心也要被刀刺透。  
2:35 见上节

2:36 又有女先知名叫亚拿、是亚设支派法内力的女儿、年纪已经老迈、从作童女出嫁的时候、同丈夫住了七年、就寡居了。  
2:37 现在已经八十四岁、〔或作就寡居了八十四年〕并不离开圣殿、禁食祈求、昼夜事奉　神。<label for="prayer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">
祷告满足了一些定律，使神可以祷作工，并使袖成就袖的目的。如果这定律不存在，则神不需要袖孩子们的祷告，而祷告是浪费时间。

2:38 正当那时、他进前来称谢　神、将孩子的事、对一切盼望耶路撒冷得救赎的人讲说。  
2:39 约瑟和马利亚照主的律法、办完了一切的事、就回加利利、到自己的城拿撒勒去了。  
2:40 孩子渐渐长大、强健起来、充满智慧。又有　神的恩在他身上。  

2:41 每年到逾越节、他父母就上耶路撒冷去。  
2:42 当他十二岁的时候、他们按着节期的规矩上去。  
2:43 守满了节期、他们回去、孩童耶稣仍旧在耶路撒冷。他的父母并不知道。  
2:44 以为他在同行的人中间、走了一天的路程、就在亲族和熟识的人中找他。  
2:45 既找不着、就回耶路撒冷去找他。  

2:46 过了三天、就遇见他在殿里、坐在教师中间、一面听、一面问。  
2:47 凡听见他的、都希奇他的聪明和他的应对。  
2:48 他父母看见就很希奇。他母亲对他说、我儿、为甚么向我们这样行呢。看哪、你父亲和我伤心来找你。  
2:49 耶稣说、为甚么找我呢。岂不知我应当以我父的事为念么。〔或作岂不知我应当在我父的家里么〕
2:50 他所说的这话、他们不明白。  

2:51 他就同他们下去、回到拿撒勒。并且顺从他们。他母亲把这一切的事都存在心里。  
2:52 耶稣的智慧和身量、〔身量或作年纪〕并　神和人喜爱他的心、都一齐增长。
