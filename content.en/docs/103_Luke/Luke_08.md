8:1 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,  
8:2 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,  
8:3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.  
8:4 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:  
8:5 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.  

8:6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.  
8:7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.  
8:8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  
8:9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
8:10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.  

8:11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.  
8:12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.  
8:13 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.  
8:14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.  
8:15 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.  

8:16 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.  
8:17 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.  
8:18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.  
8:19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.  
8:20 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.  

8:21 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.  
8:22 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.  
8:23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.  
8:24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.  
8:25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.  

8:26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.  
8:27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.  
8:28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.  
8:29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)
8:30 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.  

8:31 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.  
8:32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.  
8:33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.  
8:34 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.  
8:35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.  

8:36 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.  
8:37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.  
8:38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,  
8:39 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.  
8:40 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.  

8:41 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:  
8:42 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.  
8:43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,  
8:44 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.  
8:45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

8:46 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.  
8:47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.  
8:48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.  
8:49 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.  
8:50 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.  

8:51 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.  
8:52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.  
8:53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.  
8:54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.  
8:55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.  

8:56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.

8:1 过了不多日、耶稣周游各城各乡传道、宣讲　神国的福音。和他同去的有十二个门徒、
8:2 还有被恶鬼所附、被疾病所累、已经治好的几个妇女、内中有称为抹大拉的马利亚、曾有七个鬼从他身上赶出来。  
8:3 又有希律的家宰苦撒的妻子约亚拿、并苏撒拿、和好些别的妇女、都是用自己的财物供给耶稣和门徒。  
8:4 当许多人聚集、又有人从各城里出来见耶稣的时候、耶稣就用比喻说、
8:5 有一个撒种的出去撒种。撒的时候、有落在路旁的、被人践踏、天上的飞鸟又来吃尽了。  

8:6 有落在磐石上的、一出来就枯干了、因为得不着滋润。  
8:7 有落在荆棘里的、荆棘一同生长、把它挤住了。  
8:8 又有落在好土里的、生长起来、结实百倍。耶稣说了这些话、就大声说、有耳可听的、就应当听。  
8:9 门徒问耶稣说、这比喻是甚么意思呢。  
8:10 他说、　神国的奥秘、只叫你们知道。至于别人、就用比喻、叫他们看也看不见、听也听不明。  

8:11 这比喻乃是这样。种子就是　神的道。  
8:12 那些在路旁的、就是人听了道、随后魔鬼来、从他们心里。把道夺去、恐怕他们信了得救。  
8:13 那些在磐石上的、就是人听道、欢喜领受、但心中没有根、不过暂时相信、及至遇见试炼就退后了。[^1]  
8:14 那落在荆棘里的、就是人听了道、走开以后、被今生的思虑钱财宴乐挤住了、便结不出成熟的子粒来。  
8:15 那落在好土里的、就是人听了道、持守在诚实善良的心里、并且忍耐着结实。  

8:16 没有人点灯用器皿盖上、或放在床底下、乃是放在灯台上、叫进来的人看见亮光。  
8:17 因为掩藏的事、没有不显出来的。隐瞒的事、没有不露出来被人知道的。  
8:18 所以你们应当小心怎样听。因为凡有的、还要加给他。凡没有的、连他自以为有的、也要夺去。  
8:19 耶稣的母亲和他弟兄来了、因为人多、不得到他跟前。  
8:20 有人告诉他说、你母亲、和你弟兄、站在外边、要见你。  

8:21 耶稣回答说、听了　神之道而遵行的人、就是我的母亲、我的弟兄了。  
8:22 有一天耶稣和门徒上了船、对门徒说、我们可以渡到湖那边去。他们就开了船。  
8:23 正行的时候、耶稣睡着了。湖上忽然起了暴风、船将满了水、甚是危险。  
8:24 门徒来叫醒了他、说、夫子、夫子、我们丧命啦。耶稣醒了、斥责那狂风大浪。风浪就止住、平静了。  
8:25 耶稣对他们说、你们的信心在哪里呢。他们又惧怕、又希奇、彼此说、这到底是谁、他吩咐风和水、连风和水也听从他了。  

8:26 他们到了格拉森〔有古卷作加大拉〕人的地方、就是加利利的对面。  
8:27 耶稣上了岸、就有城里一个被鬼附着的人、迎面而来、这个人许久不穿衣服、不住房子、只住在坟茔里。  
8:28 他见了耶稣、就俯伏在他面前、大声喊叫、说、至高　神的儿子耶稣、我与你有甚么相干。求你不要叫我受苦。  
8:29 是因耶稣曾吩咐污鬼从那人身上出来。原来这鬼屡次抓住他、他常被人看守、又被铁链和脚镣捆锁、他竟把锁链挣断、被鬼赶到旷野去。  
8:30 耶稣问他说、你名叫甚么。他说、我名叫群。这是因为附着他的鬼多。  

8:31 鬼就央求耶稣、不要吩咐他们到无底坑里去。  
8:32 那里有一大群猪、在山上吃食。鬼央求耶稣、准他们进入猪里去。耶稣准了他们。  
8:33 鬼就从那人出来、进入猪里去。于是那群猪闯下山崖、投在湖里淹死了。  
8:34 放猪的看见这事就逃跑了、去告诉城里和乡下的人。  
8:35 众人出来要看是甚么事。到了耶稣那里、看见鬼所离开的那人、坐在耶稣脚前、穿着衣服、心里明白过来、他们就害怕。  

8:36 看见这事的、便将被鬼附着的人怎么得救、告诉他们。  
8:37 格拉森四围的人、因为害怕得很、都求耶稣离开他们。耶稣就上船回去了。  
8:38 鬼所离开的那人、恳求和耶稣同在。耶稣却打发他回去、
8:39 说、你回家去、传说　神为你作了何等大的事。他就去满城里传扬耶稣为他作了何等大的事。  
8:40 耶稣回来的时候、众人迎接他、因为他们都等候他。  

8:41 有一个管会堂的、名叫睚鲁、来俯伏在耶稣脚前、求耶稣到他家里去。  
8:42 因他有一个独生女儿、约有十二岁、快要死了。耶稣去的时候、众人拥挤他。  
8:43 有一个女人、患了十二年的血漏、在医生手里花尽了他一切养生的、并没有一人能医好他。  
8:44 他来到耶稣背后、摸他的衣裳繸子、血漏立刻就止住了。  
8:45 耶稣说、摸我的是谁。众人都不承认、彼得和同行的人都说、夫子、众人拥拥挤挤紧靠着你。〔有古卷在此有你还问摸我的是谁么〕

8:46 耶稣说、总有人摸我。因我觉得有能力从我身上出去。  
8:47 那女人知道不能隐藏、就战战兢兢的来俯伏在耶稣脚前、把摸他的缘故、和怎样立刻得好了、当着众人都说出来。  
8:48 耶稣对他说、女儿、你的信救了你、平平安安的去吧。  
8:49 还说话的时候、有人从管会堂的家里来说、你的女儿死了、不要劳动夫子。  
8:50 耶稣听见就对他说、不要怕、只要信、你的女儿就必得救。  

8:51 耶稣到了他的家、除了彼得、约翰、雅各、和女儿的父母、不许别人同他进去。  
8:52 众人都为这女儿哀哭捶胸。耶稣说、不要哭。他不是死了、是睡着了。  
8:53 他们晓得女儿已经死了、就嗤笑耶稣。  
8:54 耶稣拉着他的手、呼叫说、女儿、起来吧。  
8:55 他的灵魂便回来、他就立刻起来了。耶稣吩咐给他东西吃。  

8:56 他的父母惊奇得很。耶稣嘱咐他们、不要把所作的事告诉人。

没有根   
这是我的情形吗?我在肉身方面表现得异常茁壮美观，而内心的生活是否能赶得上呢?要长得好必须同时往上也往下生长才行。我的信心和爱心是否在耶稣身上扎根呢?若是我的心不受恩典的耕耘和培养，好种子虽或发长一时，但终必枯萎，因为在石头上，在未被耕碎、未被分别为圣的心上是不能发旺生长的。因此，天上的撒种者啊!求你先耕耘我，再把你的真理撒下，好让我为你结出许多子粒来。
