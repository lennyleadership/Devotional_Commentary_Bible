16:1 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.  
16:2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,  
16:3 There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.  
16:4 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.  
16:5 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.  

16:6 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.  
16:7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.  
16:8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.  
16:9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.  
16:10 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.  

16:11 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.  
16:12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.<label for="Asa" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">In public Asa appeared to put God first but quietly kept the high places of idol worship.  When he was personally afflicted with a disease his tru heart was revealed.  He did not fully trust the Lord! Oh that both in public and in private my life may trasparently and genuinely be committed to Him.  May there be no "buts" as I live for the Lord. - Choice Gleanings | David Croudace, 2024-01-16 [Refer: 2 Chronicles 15:8, 15:17]<br> We ought to seek to the Lord in our disease.</span>  
16:13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.  
16:14 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.

16:1 亚撒三十六年、以色列王巴沙上来攻击犹大、修筑拉玛不许人从犹大王亚撒那里出入。  
16:2 于是亚撒从耶和华殿和王宫的府库里、拿出金银来、送与住大马色的亚兰王便哈达、说、  
16:3 你父曾与我父立约、我与你也要立约。现在我将金银送给你。求你废掉你与以色列王巴沙所立的约、使他离开我。  
16:4 便哈达听从亚撒王的话、派军长去攻击以色列的城邑。他们就攻破以云、但、亚伯玛音、和拿弗他利一切的积货城。  
16:5 巴沙听见就停工、不修筑拉玛了。  

16:6 于是亚撒王率领犹大众人、将巴沙修筑拉玛所用的石头、木头、都运去、用以修筑迦巴和米斯巴。  
16:7 那时、先见哈拿尼来见犹大王亚撒、对他说、因你仰赖亚兰王、没有仰赖耶和华你的　神、所以亚兰王的军兵脱离了你的手。  
16:8 古实人路比人的军队不是甚大么、战车马兵不是极多么。只因你仰赖耶和华、他便将他们交在你手里。  
16:9 耶和华的眼目遍察全地、要显大能帮助向他心存诚实的人。你这事行得愚昧。此后、你必有争战的事。  
16:10 亚撒因此恼恨先见、将他囚在监里。那时亚撒也虐待一些人民。  

16:11 亚撒所行的事、自始至终、都写在犹大和以色列诸王记上。  
16:12 亚撒作王三十九年、他脚上有病、而且甚重。病的时候没有求耶和华、只求医生。  
16:13 他作王四十一年而死、与他列祖同睡、  
16:14 葬在大卫城自己所凿的坟墓里、放在床上、其床堆满各样馨香的香料、就是按作香的作法调和的香料。又为他烧了许多的物件。
