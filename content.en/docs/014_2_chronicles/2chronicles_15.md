15:1 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:  
15:2 And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.  
15:3 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.  
15:4 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.  
15:5 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.  

15:6 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.  
15:7 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.  
15:8 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.  
15:9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.  
15:10 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.  

15:11 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.  
15:12 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
15:13 That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.  
15:14 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.  
15:15 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.  

15:16 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.  
15:17 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless <b>the heart of Asa was perfect all his days</b>.  
15:18 And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.  
15:19 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.

15:1 　神的灵感动俄德的儿子亚撒利雅。  
15:2 他出来迎接亚撒、对他说、亚撒和犹大便雅悯众人哪、要听我说、<b>你们若顺从耶和华、耶和华必与你们同在。你们若寻求他、就必寻见。你们若离弃他、他必离弃你们</b>。  
15:3 以色列人不信真神、没有训诲的祭司、也没有律法、已经好久了。  
15:4 但他们在急难的时候归向耶和华以色列的　神、寻求他、他就被他们寻见。  
15:5 那时出入的人、不得平安。列国的居民、都遭大乱。  

15:6 这国攻击那国、这城攻击那城、互相破坏。因为　神用各样灾难扰乱他们。  
15:7 现在你们要刚强、不要手软。因你们所行的、必得赏赐。  
15:8 亚撒听见这话、和俄德儿子先知亚撒利雅的预言、就壮起胆来、在犹大、便雅悯全地、并以法莲山地所夺的各城、将可憎之物、尽都除掉。又在耶和华殿的廊前、重新修筑耶和华的坛。  
15:9 又招聚犹大便雅悯的众人、并他们中间寄居的以法莲人、玛拿西人、西缅人。有许多以色列人归降亚撒。因见耶和华他的　神与他同在。  
15:10 亚撒十五年三月、他们都聚集在耶路撒冷。  

15:11 当日他们从所取的掳物中、将牛七百只、羊七千只、献给耶和华。  
15:12 他们就立约、要尽心尽性地寻求耶和华他们列祖的　神。  
15:13 凡不寻求耶和华以色列　神的、无论大小、男女、必被治死。  
15:14 他们就大声欢呼、吹号吹角、向耶和华起誓。  
15:15 犹大众人为所起的誓欢喜。因他们是尽心起誓、尽意寻求耶和华、耶和华就被他们寻见、且赐他们四境平安。  

15:16 亚撒王贬了他祖母玛迦太后的位、因他造了可憎的偶像亚舍拉。亚撒砍下他的偶像、捣得粉碎、烧在汲沦溪边。  
15:17 只是丘坛还没有从以色列中废去。然而亚撒的心一生诚实。  
15:18 亚撒将他父所分别为圣、与自己所分别为圣的金银、和器皿、都奉到　神的殿里。  
15:19 从这时直到亚撒三十五年、都没有争战的事。
