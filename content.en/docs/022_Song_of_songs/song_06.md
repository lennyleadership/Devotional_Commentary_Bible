6:1 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.

6:2 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

6:3 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.

6:4 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.

6:5 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

 
6:6 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.

6:7 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.

6:8 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.

6:9 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.

6:10 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?

 
6:11 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.

6:12 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.

6:13 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.

6:1 你这女子中极美丽的、你的良人往何处去了。你的良人转向何处去了、我们好与你同去寻找他。  
6:2 我的良人下入自己园中、到香花畦、在园内牧放群羊、采百合花。  
6:3 我属我的良人、我的良人也属我。他在百合花中牧放群羊。  
6:4 我的佳偶阿、你美丽如得撒、秀美如耶路撒冷、威武如展开旌旗的军队。  
6:5 求你掉转眼目不看我、因你的眼目使我惊乱。你的头发如同山羊群、卧在基列山旁。  

6:6 你的牙齿如一群母羊、洗净上来。个个都有双生、没有一只丧掉子的。  
6:7 你的两太阳在帕子内如同一块石榴。  
6:8 有六十王后八十妃嫔、并有无数的童女。  
6:9 我的鸽子、我的完全人、只有这一个、是他母亲独生的。是生养他者所宝爱的。众女子见了、就称他有福。王后妃嫔见了、也赞美他。  
6:10 那向外观看如晨光发现、美丽如月亮、皎洁如日头、威武如展开旌旗军队的是谁呢。  

6:11 我下入核桃园、要看谷中青绿的植物、要看葡萄发芽没有、石榴开花没有。  
6:12 不知不觉、我的心将我安置在我尊长的车中。  
6:13 回来、回来。书拉密女、你回来、你回来、使我们得观看你。你们为何要观看书拉密女、像观看玛哈念跳舞的呢。
