3:1 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

3:2 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

3:3 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

3:4 It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.

3:5 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.

 
3:6 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?

3:7 Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.

3:8 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

3:9 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

3:10 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.


3:11 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

3:1 我夜间躺卧在床上、寻找我心所爱的。我寻找他、却寻不见。  
3:2 我说、我要起来、游行城中。在街市上、在宽阔处、寻找我心所爱的。我寻找他、却寻不见。  
3:3 城中巡逻看守的人遇见我。我问他们、你们看见我心所爱的没有。  
3:4 我刚离开他们、就遇见我心所爱的。我拉住他、不容他走、领他入我母家、到怀我者的内室。  
3:5 耶路撒冷的众女子阿、我指着羚羊、或田野的母鹿、嘱咐你们、不要惊动、不要叫醒我所亲爱的、等他自己情愿。〔不要叫醒云云或作不要激动爱情等他自发〕  

3:6 那从旷野上来、形状如烟柱、以没药和乳香、并商人各样香粉薰的、是谁呢。  
3:7 看哪、是所罗门的轿。四围有六十个勇士、都是以色列中的勇士。  
3:8 手都持刀、善于争战。腰间佩刀、防备夜间有惊慌。  
3:9 所罗门王用利巴嫩木、为自己制造一乘华轿。  
3:10 轿柱是用银作的、轿底是用金作的、坐垫是紫色的、其中所铺的乃耶路撒冷众女子的爱情。  

3:11 锡安的众女子阿、你们出去、观看所罗门王、头戴冠冕、就是在他婚筵的日子、心中喜乐的时候、他母亲给他戴上的。
