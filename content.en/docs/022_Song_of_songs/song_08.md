8:1 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.

8:2 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.

8:3 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.

8:4 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.

8:5 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.

 
8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.

8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.

8:8 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

8:9 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.

8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.

 
8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.

8:12 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.

8:13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.

8:14 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.

8:1 巴不得你像我的兄弟、像吃我母亲奶的兄弟。我在外头遇见你、就与你亲嘴。谁也不轻看我。  
8:2 我必引导你、领你进我母亲的家、我可以领受教训、也就使你喝石榴汁酿的香酒。  
8:3 他的左手必在我头下、他的右手必将我抱住。  
8:4 耶路撒冷的众女子阿、我嘱咐你们、不要惊动、不要叫醒我所亲爱的、等他自己情愿。〔不要叫醒云云或作不要激动爱情等他自发〕  
8:5 那靠着良人从旷野上来的、是谁呢。我在苹果树下叫醒你。你母亲在那里为你劬劳、生养你的在那里为你劬劳。  

8:6 求你将我放在你心上如印记、带在你臂上如戳记。因为爱情如死之坚强。嫉恨如阴间之残忍。所发的电光、是火焰的电光、是耶和华的烈焰。  
8:7 爱情、众水不能息灭、大水也不能淹没。若有人拿家中所有的财宝要换爱情、就全被藐视。  
8:8 我们有一小妹、他的两乳尚未长成。人来提亲的日子、我们当为他怎样办理。  
8:9 他若是墙、我们要在其上建造银塔。他若是门、我们要用香柏木板围护他。  
8:10 我是墙、我两乳像其上的楼。那时我在他眼中像得平安的人。  
 
8:11 所罗门在巴力哈们有一葡萄园。他将这葡萄园交给看守的人、为其中的果子必交一千舍客勒银子。  
8:12 我自己的葡萄园在我面前。所罗门哪、一千舍客勒归你、二百舍客勒归看守果子的人。  
8:13 你这住在园中的、同伴都要听你的声音。求你使我也得听见。  
8:14 我的良人哪、求你快来、如羚羊或小鹿在香草山上。
