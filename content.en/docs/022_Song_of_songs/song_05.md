5:1 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

5:2 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.

5:3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?

5:4 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.

5:5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.

 
5:6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

5:7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.

5:8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.

5:9 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?

5:10 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.

 
5:11 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.

5:12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.

5:13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

5:14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.

5:15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

 
5:16 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

5:1 我妹子、我新妇、我进了我的园中、采了我的没药和香料、吃了我的蜜房和蜂蜜。喝了我的酒和奶。我的朋友们、请吃、我所亲爱的、请喝、且多多的喝。
5:2 我身睡卧、我心却醒。这是我良人的声音。他敲门、说、我的妹子、我的佳偶、我的鸽子、我的完全人、求你给我开门、因我的头满了露水、我的头发被夜露滴湿。
5:3 我回答说、我脱了衣裳、怎能再穿上呢。我洗了脚、怎能再玷污呢。  
5:4 我的良人从门孔里伸进手来、我便因他动了心。  
5:5 我起来、要给我良人开门。我的两手滴下没药、我的指头有没药汁滴在门闩上。  

5:6 我给我的良人开了门。我的良人却已转身走了。他说话的时候、我神不守舍。我寻找他、竟寻不见。我呼叫他、他却不回答。  
5:7 城中巡逻看守的人遇见我、打了我、伤了我。看守城墙的人夺去我的披肩。  
5:8 耶路撒冷的众女子阿、我嘱咐你们、若遇见我的良人、要告诉他、我因思爱成病。  
5:9 你这女子中极美丽的、你的良人、比别人的良人有何强处。你的良人、比别人的良人有何强处、你就这样嘱咐我们。  
5:10 我的良人、白而且红、超乎万人之上。  

5:11 他的头像至精的金子。他的头发厚密累垂、黑如乌鸦。  
5:12 他的眼如溪水旁的鸽子眼、用奶洗净、安得合式。  
5:13 他的两腮如香花畦、如香草台。他的嘴唇像百合花、且滴下没药汁。  
5:14 他的两手好像金管、镶嵌水苍玉。他的身体如同雕刻的象牙、周围镶嵌蓝宝石。  
5:15 他的腿好像白玉石柱、安在精金座上。他的形状如利巴嫩、且佳美如香柏树。  

5:16 他的口极其甘甜。他全然可爱。耶路撒冷的众女子阿、这是我的良人、这是我的朋友。
