1:1 The song of songs, which is Solomon's.

1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.

1:3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

1:4 <b>Draw</b> me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.<a id="1_ref" href = "#1">[1]</a> <label class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">    Song of Solomon 1:4 : [Hos. 11:4; John 6:44; 12:32]

1:5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

 
1:6 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.

1:7 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

1:8 If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.

1:9 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.

1:10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.

 
1:11 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

1:12 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.

1:13 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.

1:14 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.

1:15 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.

 
1:16 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.

1:17 The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.
