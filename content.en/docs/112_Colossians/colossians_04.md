4:1 Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.  
4:2 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;  
4:3 Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:  
4:4 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.  
4:5 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.  
4:6 Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.  
4:7 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:  
4:8 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;  
4:9 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.  
4:10 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)  
4:11 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.  
4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.  
4:13 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.  
4:14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.  
4:15 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.  
4:16 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.  
4:17 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.  
4:18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.

4:1 你们作主人的、要公公平平的待仆人、因为知道你们也有一位主在天上。  
4:2 你们要恒切祷告、在此儆醒感恩。  
4:3 也要为我们祷告、求　神给我们开传道的门、能以讲基督的奥秘、（我为此被捆锁)  
4:4 叫我按着所该说的话、将这奥秘发明出来。  
4:5 你们要爱惜光阴、用智慧与外人交往。  

4:6 你们的言语要常常带着和气、好像用盐调和、就可知道该怎样回答各人。  
4:7 有我亲爱的兄弟推基古要将我一切的事都告诉你们。他是忠心的执事、和我一同作主的仆人。  
4:8 我特意打发他到你们那里去、好叫你们知道我们的光景、又叫他安慰你们的心。  
4:9 我又打发一位亲爱忠心的兄弟阿尼西母同去。他也是你们那里的人。他们要把这里一切的事都告诉你们。  
4:10 与我一同坐监的亚里达古问你们安。巴拿巴的表弟马可也问你们安。（说到这马可、你们已经受了吩咐。他若到了你们那里、你们就接待他。)  

4:11 耶数又称为犹士都、也问你们安。奉割礼的人中、只有这三个人、是为　神的国与我一同作工的、也是叫我心里得安慰的。  
4:12 有你们那里的人、作基督耶稣仆人的以巴弗问你们安。他在祷告之间、常为你们竭力的祈求、愿你们在　神一切的旨意上、得以完全、信心充足、能站立得稳。  
4:13 他为你们和老底嘉并希拉波立的弟兄、多多的劳苦。这是我可以给他作见证的。  
4:14 所亲爱的医生路加、和底马问你们安。  
4:15 请问老底嘉的弟兄和宁法、并他家里的教会安。  

4:16 你们念了这书信、便交给老底嘉的教会、叫他们也念。你们也要念从老底嘉来的书信。  
4:17 要对亚基布说、务要谨慎、尽你从主所受的职分。  
4:18 我保罗亲笔问你们安。你们要记念我的捆锁。愿恩惠常与你们同在。
