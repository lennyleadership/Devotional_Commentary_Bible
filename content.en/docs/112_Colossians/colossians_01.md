1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,  
1:2 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
1:3 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,  
1:4 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,  
1:5 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;  
1:6 Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:  
1:7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;  
1:8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.  
1:9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;  
1:10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;  
1:11 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;  
1:12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:  
1:13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:  
1:14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:  
1:15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:  
1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: <a class = "marginnote">v16: Be submissive to authority because they were created by Jesus and for Jesus</a>  
1:17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.  
1:18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.  
1:19 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;  
1:20 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.  
1:21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
1:22 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:  
1:23 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;  
1:24 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:  
1:25 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;  
1:26 Even <a class = "blue">the mystery</a> which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:  
1:27 To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of <a class = "blue">this mystery</a> among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:  
1:28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:  
1:29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.

1:1 奉　神旨意、作基督耶稣使徒的保罗、和兄弟提摩太、  
1:2 写信给歌罗西的圣徒、在基督里有忠心的弟兄。愿恩惠平安、从　神我们的父、归与你们。  
1:3 我们感谢　神我们主耶稣基督的父、常常为你们祷告。  
1:4 因听见你们在基督耶稣里的信心、并向众圣徒的爱心。  
1:5 是为那给你们存在天上的盼望。这盼望就是你们从前在福音真理的道上所听见的。  

1:6 这福音传到你们那里、也传到普天之下、并且结果增长、如同在你们中间、自从你们听见福音、真知道　神恩惠的日子一样。  
1:7 正如你们从我们所亲爱、一同作仆人的以巴弗所学的。他为我们〔有古卷作你们〕作了基督忠心的执事。  
1:8 也把你们因圣灵所存的爱心告诉了我们。  
1:9 因此、我们自从听见的日子、也就为你们不住的祷告祈求、愿你们在一切属灵的智慧悟性上、满心知道　神的旨意。  
1:10 好叫你们行事为人对得起主、凡事蒙他喜悦、在一切善事上结果子、渐渐的多知道　神。  

1:11 照他荣耀的权能、得以在各样的力上加力、好叫你们凡事欢欢喜喜的忍耐宽容。  
1:12 又感谢父、叫我们能与众圣徒在光明中同得基业。  
1:13 他救了我们脱离黑暗的权势、把我们迁到他爱子的国里。  
1:14 我们在爱子里得蒙救赎、罪过得以赦免。  
1:15 爱子是那不能看见之　神的像、是首生的、在一切被造的以先。<a class = "marginnote">KJV 的翻译是 the firstborn of every creature。非常受争议的经文。<br>李常受弟兄的解经是，耶稣既是创造者，又是受造者。见 [https://www.jdt365.net/post/902.html]</a>

1:16 因为万有都是靠他造的、无论是天上的、地上的、能看见的、不能看见的、或是有位的、主治的、执政的、掌权的、一概都是借着他造的、又是为他造的。  
1:17 他在万有之先。万有也靠他而立。  
1:18 他也是教会全体之首。他是元始、是从死里首先复生的、使他可以在凡事上居首位。  
1:19 因为父喜欢叫一切的丰盛、在他里面居住。  
1:20 既然借着他在十字架上所流的血、成就了和平、便借着他叫万有、无论是地上的、天上的、都与自己和好了。  

1:21 你们从前与　神隔绝、因着恶行、心里与他为敌。  
1:22 但如今他借着基督的肉身受死、叫你们与自己和好、都成了圣洁、没有瑕疵、无可责备、把你们引到自己面前。  
1:23 只要你们在所信的道上恒心、根基稳固、坚定不移、不至被引动失去〔原文作离开〕福音的盼望。这福音就是你们所听过的、也是传与普天下万人听的。〔万人原文作凡受造的〕我保罗也作了这福音的执事。  
1:24 现在我为你们受苦、倒觉欢乐、并且为基督的身体、就是为教会、要在我肉身上补满基督患难的缺欠。  
1:25 我照　神为你们所赐我的职分、作了教会的执事、要把　神的道理传得全备。  

1:26 这道理就是历世历代所隐藏的奥秘、但如今向他的圣徒显明了。  
1:27 　神愿意叫他们知道、这奥秘在外邦人中有何等丰盛的荣耀。就是基督在你们心里成了有荣耀的盼望。  
1:28 我们传扬他、是用诸般的智慧、劝戒各人、教导各人。要把各人在基督里完完全全的引到　神面前。  
1:29 我也为此劳苦、照着他在我里面运用的大能、尽心竭力。
