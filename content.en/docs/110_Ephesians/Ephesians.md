Ephesians Chapter 1   
1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:  
1:2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.  
1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:  
1:4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:  
1:5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,  
 
1:6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.  
1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;  
1:8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;  
1:9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:  
1:10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:  
 
1:11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:  
1:12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.  
1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,  
1:14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.  
1:15 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,  
 
1:16 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;  
1:17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:  
1:18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,  
1:19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,  
1:20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,  
 
1:21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:  
1:22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,  
1:23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

Ephesians Chapter 2   
2:1 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;  
2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:  
2:3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.  
2:4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,  
2:5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)  
 
2:6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:  
2:7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.  
2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  
2:9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.  
2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.  
 
2:11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;  
2:12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:  
2:13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.  
2:14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;  
2:15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;  
 
2:16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:  
2:17 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.  
2:18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.  
2:19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;  
2:20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;  
 
2:21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:  
2:22 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.

Ephesians Chapter 3   
3:1 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,  
3:2 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:  
3:3 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,  
3:4 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)  
3:5 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;  
 
3:6 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:  
3:7 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.  
3:8 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;  
3:9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:  
3:10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,  
 
3:11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:  
3:12 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.  
3:13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.  
3:14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
3:15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,  
 
3:16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;  
3:17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,  
3:18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;  
3:19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.  
3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,  
 
3:21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.

Ephesians Chapter 4   
4:1 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,  
4:2 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;  
4:3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.  
4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;  
4:5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,  
 
4:6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.  
4:7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.  
4:8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.  
4:9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
4:10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)  
 
4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;  
4:12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:  
4:13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:  
4:14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;  
4:15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:  
 
4:16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.  
4:17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,  
4:18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:  
4:19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.  
4:20 But ye have not so learned Christ;  
 
4:21 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:  
4:22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;  
4:23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;  
4:24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.  
4:25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.  
 
4:26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:  
4:27 Neither give place to the devil.  
4:28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.  
4:29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.  
4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.  
 
4:31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:  
4:32 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

Ephesians Chapter 5   
5:1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;  
5:2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.  
5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;  
5:4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.  
5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.  
 
5:6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.  
5:7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.  
5:8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:  
5:9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)  
5:10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.  
 
5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.  
5:12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.  
5:13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.  
5:14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.  
5:15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,  
 
5:16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.  
5:17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.  
5:18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;  
5:19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;  
5:20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;  
 
5:21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.  
5:22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  
5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.  
5:24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.  
5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;  
 
5:26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,  
5:27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.  
5:28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.  
5:29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:  
5:30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.  
 
5:31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.  
5:32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.  
5:33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

Ephesians Chapter 6   
6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.  
6:2 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;  
6:3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.  
6:4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.  
6:5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;  
 
6:6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;  
6:7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:  
6:8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.  
6:9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.  
6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.  
 
6:11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  
6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.  
6:13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.  
6:14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;  
6:15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;  
 
6:16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.  
6:17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:  
6:18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;  
6:19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,  
6:20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.  
 
6:21 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:  
6:22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.  
6:23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
6:24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.  


1:1 奉　神旨意、作基督耶稣使徒的保罗、写信给在以弗所的圣徒、就是在基督耶稣里有忠心的人。  
1:2 愿恩惠平安、从　神我们的父、和主耶稣基督、归与你们。  
1:3 愿颂赞归与我们主耶稣基督的父　神、他在基督里、曾赐给我们天上各样属灵的福气。  
1:4 就如　神从创立世界以前、在基督里拣选了我们、使我们在他面前成为圣洁、无有瑕疵。  
1:5 又因爱我们、就按着自己意旨所喜悦的、预定我们、借着耶稣基督得儿子的名分、  

1:6 使他荣耀的恩典得着称赞。这恩典是他在爱子里所赐给我们的。  
1:7 我们借这爱子的血、得蒙救赎、过犯得以赦免、乃是照他丰富的恩典。  
1:8 这恩典是　神用诸般智慧聪明、充充足足赏给我们的、  
1:9 都是照他自己所预定的美意、叫我们知道他旨意的奥秘、  
1:10 要照所安排的、在日期满足的时候、使天上地上一切所有的、都在基督里面同归于一。  

1:11 我们也在他里面得了基业、〔得或作成〕这原是那位随己意行作万事的、照着他旨意所预定的。  
1:12 叫他的荣耀、从我们这首先在基督里有盼望的人、可以得着称赞。  
1:13 你们既听见真理的道、就是那叫你们得救的福音、也信了基督、既然信他、就受了所应许的圣灵为印记。  
1:14 这圣灵、是我们得基业的凭据、〔原文作质〕直等到　神之民〔民原文作产业〕被赎、使他的荣耀得着称赞。  
1:15 因此、我既听见你们信从主耶稣、亲爱众圣徒、  

1:16 就为你们不住的感谢　神、祷告的时候、常提到你们。  
1:17 求我们主耶稣基督的　神、荣耀的父、将那赐人智慧和启示的灵、赏给你们、使你们真知道他。  
1:18 并且照明你们心中的眼睛、使你们知道他的恩召有何等指望。他在圣徒中得的基业、有何等丰盛的荣耀。  
1:19 并知道他向我们这信的人所显的能力、是何等浩大、  
1:20 就是照他在基督身上、所运行的大能大力、使他从死里复活、叫他在天上坐在自己的右边、  

1:21 远超过一切执政的、掌权的、有能的、主治的、和一切有名的。不但是今世的、连来世的也都超过了。  
1:22 又将万有服在他的脚下、使他为教会作万有之首。  
1:23 教会是他的身体、是那充满万有者所充满的。

以弗所书 2章  

2:1 你们死在过犯罪恶之中、他叫你们活过来。  
2:2 那时、你们在其中行事为人随从今世的风俗、顺服空中掌权者的首领、就是现今在悖逆之子心中运行的邪灵。  
2:3 我们从前也都在他们中间、放纵肉体的私欲、随着肉体和心中所喜好的去行、本为可怒之子、和别人一样。  
2:4 然而　神既有丰富的怜悯。因他爱我们的大爱、  
2:5 当我们死在过犯中的时候、便叫我们与基督一同活过来。（你们得救是本乎恩)  

2:6 他又叫我们与基督耶稣一同复活、一同坐在天上、  
2:7 要将他极丰富的恩典、就是他在基督耶稣里向我们所施的恩慈、显明给后来的世代看。  
2:8 你们得救是本乎恩、也因着信、这并不是出于自己、乃是　神所赐的。  
2:9 也不是出于行为、免得有人自夸。  
2:10 我们原是他的工作、在基督耶稣里造成的、为要叫我们行善、就是　神所预备叫我们行的。  

2:11 所以你们应当记念、你们从前按肉体是外邦人、是称为没受割礼的这名原是那些凭人手在肉身上称为受割礼之人所起的。  
2:12 那时、你们与基督无关、在以色列国民以外、在所应许的诸约上是局外人。并且活在世上没有指望、没有　神。  
2:13 你们从前远离　神的人、如今却在基督耶稣里、靠着他的血、已经得亲近了。  
2:14 因他使我们和睦、〔原文作因他是我们的和睦〕将两下合而为一、拆毁了中间隔断的墙。  
2:15 而且以自己的身体、废掉冤仇、就是那记在律法上的规条。为要将两下、借着自己造成一个新人、如此便成就了和睦。  

2:16 既在十字架上灭了冤仇、便借这十字架、使两下归为一体、与　神和好了。  
2:17 并且来传和平的福音给你们远处的人、也给那近处的人。  
2:18 因为我们两下借着他被一个圣灵所感、得以进到父面前。  
2:19 这样、你们不再作外人、和客旅、是与圣徒同国、是　神家里的人了。  
2:20 并且被建造在使徒和先知的根基上、有基督耶稣自己为房角石。  

2:21 各〔或作全〕房靠他联络得合式、渐渐成为主的圣殿。  
2:22 你们也靠他同被建造成为　神借着圣灵居住的所在。  

------------------------------------------

以弗所书 3章  

3:1 因此、我保罗为你们外邦人作了基督耶稣被囚的、替你们祈祷。〔此句乃照对十四节所加〕
3:2 谅必你们曾听见　神赐恩给我、将关切你们的职分托付我、  
3:3 用启示使我知道福音的奥秘、正如我以前略略写过的。  
3:4 你们念了、就能晓得我深知基督的奥秘。  
3:5 这奥秘在以前的世代、没有叫人知道、像如今借着圣灵启示他的圣使徒和先知一样。  

3:6 这奥秘就是外邦人在基督耶稣里、借着福音、得以同为后嗣、同为一体、同蒙应许。  
3:7 我作了这福音的执事、是照　神的恩赐。这恩赐是照他运行的大能赐给我的。  
3:8 我本来比众圣徒中最小的还小。然而他还赐我这恩典、叫我把基督那测不透的丰富、传给外邦人。  
3:9 又使众人都明白、这历代以来隐藏在创造万物之　神里的奥秘、是如何安排的。  
3:10 为要借着教会、使天上执政的、掌权的、现在得知　神百般的智慧。  

3:11 这是照　神从万世以前、在我们主基督耶稣里所定的旨意。  
3:12 我们因信耶稣、就在他里面放胆无惧、笃信不疑的来到　神面前。  
3:13 所以我求你们、不要因我为你们所受的患难丧胆。这原是你们的荣耀。  
3:14 因此。我在父面前屈膝、  
3:15 （天上地上的各〔或作全〕家、都是从他得名)  

3:16 求他按着他丰盛的荣耀、借着他的灵、叫你们心里的力量刚强起来、  
3:17 使基督因你们的信、住在你们心里、叫你们的爱心、有根有基、  
3:18 能以和众圣徒一同明白基督的爱、是何等长阔高深、  
3:19 并知道这爱是过于人所能测度的、便叫　神一切所充满的、充满了你们。  
3:20 　神能照着运行在我们心里的大力、充充足足的成就一切超过我们所求所想的。  

3:21 但愿他在教会中、并在基督耶稣里、得着荣耀、直到世世代代、永永远远。阿们。

以弗所书 4章   

4:1 我为主被囚的劝你们、既然蒙召、行事为人就当与蒙召的恩相称。  
4:2 凡事谦虚、温柔、忍耐、用爱心互相宽容、  
4:3 用和平彼此联络、竭力保守圣灵所赐合而为一的心。  
4:4 身体只有一个、圣灵只有一个、正如你们蒙召、同有一个指望、  
4:5 一主、一信、一洗、  

4:6 一　神、就是众人的父、超乎众人之上、贯乎众人之中、也住在众人之内。  
4:7 我们各人蒙恩、都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。  
4:8 所以经上说、『他升上高天的时候、掳掠了仇敌、将各样的恩赐赏给人。』  
4:9 （既说升上、岂不是先降在地下么。  
4:10 那降下的、就是远升诸天之上要充满万有的。)  

4:11 他所赐的有使徒、有先知。有传福音的。有牧师和教师。  
4:12 为要成全圣徒、各尽其职、建立基督的身体。  
4:13 直等到我们众人在真道上同归于一、认识　神的儿子、得以长大成人、满有基督长成的身量。  
4:14 使我们不再作小孩子、中了人的诡计、和欺骗的法术、被一切异教之风摇动、飘来飘去、就随从各样的异端。  
4:15 惟用爱心说诚实话、凡事长进、连于元首基督。  

4:16 全身都靠他联络得合式、百节各按各职、照着各体的功用、彼此相助、便叫身体渐渐增长、在爱中建立自己。  
4:17 所以我说、且在主里确实的说、你们行事、不要再像外邦人存虚妄的心行事。  
4:18 他们心地昏昧、与　神所赐的生命隔绝了、都因自己无知、心里刚硬。  
4:19 良心既然丧尽、就放纵私欲、贪行种种的污秽。  
4:20 你们学了基督、却不是这样。  

4:21 如果你们听过他的道、领了他的教、学了他的真理、  
4:22 就要脱去你们从前行为上的旧人。这旧人是因私欲的迷惑、渐渐变坏的。  
4:23 又要将你们的心志改换一新。  
4:24 并且穿上新人。这新人是照着　神的形像造的、有真理的仁义、和圣洁。  
4:25 所以你们要弃绝谎言、各人与邻舍说实话。因为我们是互相为肢体。  

4:26 生气却不要犯罪。不可含怒到日落。  
4:27 也不可给魔鬼留地步。  
4:28 从前偷窃的、不要再偷。总要劳力、亲手作正经事、就可有余、分给那缺少的人。  
4:29 污秽的言语、一句不可出口、只要随事说造就人的好话、叫听见的人得益处。  
4:30 不要叫　神的圣灵担忧。你们原是受了他的印记、等候得赎的日子来到。  

4:31 一切苦毒、恼恨、忿怒、嚷闹、毁谤、并一切的恶毒、〔或作阴毒〕都当从你们中间除掉。  
4:32 并要以恩慈相待、存怜悯的心、彼此饶恕、正如　神在基督里饶恕了你们一样。

以弗所书 5章   

5:1 所以你们该效法　神、好像蒙慈爱的儿女一样。  
5:2 也要凭爱心行事、正如基督爱我们、为我们舍了自己、当作馨香的供物、和祭物、献与　神。  
5:3 至于淫乱、并一切污秽、或是贪婪、在你们中间连提都不可、方合圣徒的体统。  
5:4 淫词、妄语、和戏笑的话、都不相宜、总要说感谢的话。  
5:5 因为你们确实的知道、无论是淫乱的、是污秽的、是有贪心的、在基督和　神的国里、都是无分的。有贪心的、就与拜偶像的一样。  

5:6 不要被人虚浮的话欺哄。因这些事、　神的忿怒必临到那悖逆之子。  
5:7 所以你们不要与他们同伙。  
5:8 从前你们是暗昧的、但如今在主里面是光明的、行事为人就当像光明的子女。  
5:9 光明所结的果子、就是一切良善、公义、诚实。  
5:10 总要察验何为主所喜悦的事。  

5:11 那暗昧无益的事、不要与人同行、倒要责备行这事的人。  
5:12 因为他们暗中所行的、就是提起来、也是可耻的。  
5:13 凡事受了责备、就被光显明出来。因为一切能显明的、就是光。  
5:14 所以主说、你这睡着的人、当醒过来、从死里复活、基督就要光照你了。  
5:15 你们要谨慎行事、不要像愚昧人、当像智慧人。  

5:16 要爱惜光阴、因为现今的世代邪恶。  
5:17 不要作糊涂人、要明白主的旨意如何。  
5:18 不要醉酒、酒能使人放荡、乃要被圣灵充满。  
5:19 当用诗章、颂词、灵歌、彼此对说、口唱心和的赞美主。  
5:20 凡事要奉我们主耶稣基督的名、常常感谢父　神。  

5:21 又当存敬畏基督的心、彼此顺服。  
5:22 你们作妻子的、当顺服自己的丈夫、如同顺服主。  
5:23 因为丈夫是妻子的头、如同基督是教会的头。他又是教会全体的救主。  
5:24 教会怎样顺服基督、妻子也要怎样凡事顺服丈夫。  
5:25 你们作丈夫的、要爱你们的妻子、正如基督爱教会、为教会舍己。  

5:26 要用水借着道、把教会洗净、成为圣洁、  
5:27 可以献给自己、作个荣耀的教会、毫无玷污皱纹等类的病、乃是圣洁没有瑕疵的。  
5:28 丈夫也当照样爱妻子、如同爱自己的身子。爱妻子、便是爱自己了。  
5:29 从来没有人恨恶自己的身子、总是保养顾惜、正像基督待教会一样。  
5:30 因我们是他身上的肢体。〔有古卷在此有就是他的骨他的肉〕

5:31 为这个缘故、人要离开父母、与妻子连合、二人成为一体。  
5:32 这是极大的奥秘、但我是指着基督和教会说的。  
5:33 然而你们各人都当爱妻子、如同爱自己一样。妻子也当敬重他的丈夫。

以弗所书 6章  

6:1 你们作儿女的、要在主里听从父母、这是理所当然的。  
6:2 要孝敬父母、使你得福、在世长寿。这是第一条带应许的诫命。  
6:3 见上节
6:4 你们作父亲的、不要惹儿女的气、只要照着主的教训和警戒、养育他们。  
6:5 你们作仆人的、要惧怕战兢、用诚实的心听从你们肉身的主人、好像听从基督一般。  

6:6 不要只在眼前事奉、像是讨人喜欢的、要像基督的仆人、从心里遵行　神的旨意。  
6:7 甘心事奉、好像服事主、不像服事人。  
6:8 因为晓得各人所行的善事、不论是为奴的、是自主的、都必按所行的得主的赏赐。  
6:9 你们作主人的待仆人、也是一理、不要威吓他们。因为知道他们和你们、同有一位主在天上、他并不偏待人。  
6:10 我还有末了的话、你们要靠着主、倚赖他的大能大力、作刚强的人。  

6:11 要穿戴　神所赐的全副军装、就能抵挡魔鬼的诡计。  
6:12 因我们并不是与属血气的争战、乃是与那些执政的、掌权的、管辖这幽暗世界的、以及天空属灵气的恶魔争战。〔两争战原文都作摔跤〕
6:13 所以要拿起　神所赐的全副军装、好在磨难的日子、抵挡仇敌、并且成就了一切、还能站立得住。  
6:14 所以要站稳了、用真理当作带子束腰、用公义当作护心镜遮胸。  
6:15 又用平安的福音、当作预备走路的鞋穿在脚上。  

6:16 此外又拿着信德当作藤牌、可以灭尽那恶者一切的火箭。  
6:17 并戴上救恩的头盔、拿着圣灵的宝剑、就是　神的道。  
6:18 靠着圣灵、随时多方祷告祈求、并要在此儆醒不倦、为众圣徒祈求、  
6:19 也为我祈求、使我得着口才、能以放胆、开口讲明福音的奥秘、  
6:20 （我为这福音的奥秘、作了带锁链的使者)并使我照着当尽的本分、放胆讲论。  

6:21 今有所亲爱忠心事奉主的兄弟推基古、他要把我的事情并我的景况如何、全告诉你们叫你们知道。  
6:22 我特意打发他到你们那里去、好叫你们知道我们的光景、又叫他安慰你们的心。  
6:23 愿平安、仁爱、信心、从父　神和主耶稣基督、归与弟兄们。  
6:24 并愿所有诚心爱我们主耶稣基督的人、都蒙恩惠。
