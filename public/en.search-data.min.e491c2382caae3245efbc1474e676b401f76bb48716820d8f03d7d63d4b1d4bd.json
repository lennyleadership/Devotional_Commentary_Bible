参考资源：希伯来书第1章逐节注解、祷读\n第一章的主题是「圣子超越万有」，与十三章「圣徒超越逆境」首尾呼应。\n1-4节原文是由多个子句组成的一句话，堪称古典希腊文中最高雅的杰作之一，「古时 πάλαι」、「众先知 προφήταις」、「多次 πολυμερῶς」、「多方πολυτρόπως」、「列祖 πατράσιν」原文都是用希腊字母「派 π」开头。作者首先用22节经文阐明了神儿子的所是和所作（一1-二8），然后才指出：神的儿子就是耶稣基督（二9）。\n神「在古时借着众先知多次多方地晓谕列祖」（1节），循序渐进地透过旧约时代的先知，以不同的方式向犹太人的祖先启示祂的旨意。神若不主动向人说话，人就不可能认识神；神在古时所说的话，在每个世代都有现实意义。因为神是「永不改变」（12节）的，永恒的真理既不会过时，也不必与时俱进；「从前一次交付圣徒的真道」（犹3），不需要根据现实问题进行「神学创新」。\n「末世」（2节）并非指将来的世代，而是我们现在正处于的世代（林前十11），指从弥赛亚第一次降世到祂再来之间的新约时代（九26），又称为「末后的日子」（徒二17）。在犹太人的观念中，历史可以分为现今的世代和弥赛亚来临之后的未来的世代，即「今世、来世」（太十二32；可十30；路十八30），但新约进一步教导，「来世」因着主耶稣已经临到了。现在是两个世代互相重叠的「末世」，信徒已经被拯救脱离了现今「罪恶的世代」（加一4），并且已经开始尝到「来世权能」（来六5）。\n「在这末世借着祂儿子晓谕我们」（2节），指神儿子的道成肉身开启了「末世」。旧约的历史是有价值的，因为神透过历史说话；但旧约的历史也是不完全的，因为只有神的儿子才是启示的顶峰。神自我启示的顶点，就是「借着祂儿子」来发表祂自己。神「借着众先知」所说的一切话，都是为「祂儿子」作预备。「众先知」说出了神的「道」，而神的儿子自己就是神的「道」（约一1）。因为「从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来」（约一18），圣子在地上的所是和所作（2-3节），向世人显明了圣父的所是和所作。 神借着旧约众先知晓谕列祖（1节）、又借着祂儿子晓谕我们（2节），但却从来没有借着使徒发表晓谕（二2-4；十二25）。新约圣经所有的内容，都是在圣灵的引导下阐明神儿子自己的启示（约十四26；十六13-14）。\n1-4节宣告了神的儿子超越万有的所是和所作：\n\r祂是所有者：神「早已立祂为承受万有的」（2节），神的儿子拥有世界（林前十26），「从创立世界以前」（弗一4）就是神荣耀计划的目的、永远旨意的中心（弗一10）。正因为如此，宇宙的存在才有了根据和意义。 祂是创造者：神的儿子就是神的道（约一1），神「曾借着祂创造诸世界」（2节；约一3；创一1-3；诗三十三6），包括物质与非物质的世界（创一1；约一1-3；林前八6），也为人类的命运制定了美好的旨意。历史的目的就是让神国临到地上、神的儿子作王（林前十五25）。因此，人的一生若与神的计划无关，无论做什么都没有永恒的意义。「诸世界」原文是「诸世代」，是犹太人的惯用语，指宇宙的时间和空间。\r祂与神合一：神的儿子「是神荣耀所发的光辉，是神本体的真像」（3节），「与父原为一」（约十30），与神的本性完全相同。「神本性一切的丰盛都有形有体地居住在基督里面」（西二9），祂的圣洁、公义、怜悯、慈爱、荣耀、大能、智慧，都是神本性的彰显（约一14）。神的本性是合一的，并没有某种属性凌驾于别的属性之上或之先。神的儿子在地上的服事，见证了神的荣耀（约二11），人看见祂就看见了神（约十四9；西一15）、认识了神，而祂所彰显的不但是一位慈爱拯救的神（约壹四10）、也是一位公义审判的神（徒十七31）。「本体」原文指本性、本质。「真像 χαρακτήρ/charakter」原文是印模在钱币上压出的印记，后来演变为英文的「性格 character」。\r祂是护理者：「常用祂权能的命令托住万有」（3节），话语里带着权柄和能力。「托住万有」，指维持宇宙井然有序地稳定运行，把宇宙和历史带向神所既定的目标（林前十五24-25；启二十二5）。神的儿子就是「道」，神借着「道」创造了万有（约一1-3；创一3），也借着「道」维持万有，「祂在万有之先；万有也靠祂而立」（西一17）。科学家至今仍搞不清维系宇宙万物的引力、电磁力、强作用力、弱作用力的本质到底是什么。他们发现宇宙的总物质不足以产生足够的引力来维持星系，就假设存在不可探测的暗物质；他们发现宇宙的总能量不足以解释宇宙的加速膨胀，就猜测存在不可探测的暗能量。结果，根据兰姆达暗物质模型（ΛCDM Model）和普朗克卫星的探测数据，整个宇宙的构成中，常规物质占4.9%，暗物质占26.8%，暗能量占68.3%。也就是说，科学家们为了自圆其说，凭信心在数学模型中加入了「眼不能见」（罗一20）的「信心常数」，结果发现，这个宇宙竟然要靠95.1%「眼不能见」的暗物质和暗能量来维持，完全颠覆了「眼见为实」的传统唯物观。而神早就「晓谕」我们，是祂的儿子「常用祂权能的命令托住万有」；创造万有的神并非自然神论者所说的钟表匠，造好钟表、上紧发条以后，就任宇宙自生自灭。\r祂是救赎者：「洗净了人的罪」（3节），是真正的赎罪日献祭（十3-4）。「因为祂一次献祭，便叫那得以成圣的人永远完全」（十14），让人「得与神和好」（罗五10），把万有恢复到神起初的旨意里去。神的儿子一面「托住万有」，令人高不可攀；一面又「洗净了人的罪」，让人可近可亲。宇宙如此之大，人类如此渺小，但人的罪却需要宇宙的创造者和护理者亲自施行救赎，可见罪已经严重危害了神的创造（罗八22），任何一种试图「不讲、淡化或排除」罪的「神学创新」，都是否定救赎的「别的福音」（加一6）。\r祂是得胜者：现在「坐在高天至大者的右边」（3节），等候神使祂的仇敌作祂的脚凳（13节；十13）。祂之所以能登上宝座，是因为祂「洗净了人的罪」，再一次强调了罪对创造的危害是何等严重。会幕和圣殿里都没有祭司的座位，因为他们的工作从未完成、也没有资格坐在圣洁之神面前。但是，神的儿子「献了一次永远的赎罪祭」（十12），就完成了救赎大工，不必多次献祭，「因为祂一次献祭，便叫那得以成圣的人永远完全」（十14）。「右边」在古代中东代表尊荣的地位（王上二19；诗四十五9；结十3；路一11），犹太人都知道坐在神宝座右边的就是弥赛亚（诗一百一十1；徒二25、33-34）。\r祂超越天使：神的儿子道成肉身后，「比天使微小一点」（二7）、降卑于天使之下，但却借着死而复活，被「神将祂升为至高，又赐给祂那超乎万名之上的名」（腓二9）。在圣经里，名字代表一个人的特性（撒上二十五25）。只有神的儿子才配作神完全的发表（约十四11），「祂所承受的名」（4节）乃是「儿子」（5节）的名，所以「比天使的名更尊贵」（4节），「因为在天下人间，没有赐下别的名，我们可以靠着得救」（徒四12）。因此，神「借着祂儿子」向人类说话，也「远超过天使」（4节），比借着天使所传的律法更有权威（二2）。当时的犹太人非常推崇「天使」，甚至可能「敬拜天使」（西二18）。死海古卷表明，当时有些犹太人相信将有两位弥赛亚，君王弥赛亚低于祭司弥赛亚，而两位弥赛亚都在天使长米迦勒之下，天使在神国的地位高于人。而现代的耶和华见证人则认为弥赛亚是天使长米迦勒，但圣经却告诉我们，天使只是「服役的灵」（14节）。\r\r5-14节引用了七段旧约经文，从七个方面宣告神的儿子超越天使：\n祂是受生的儿子（5节）；\n祂接受天使的敬拜（6节）；\n祂的仆役是天使（7节）；\n祂是神国之王（8-9节）；\n祂是创造者（10节）；\n祂是长存者（10-12节）；\n祂是得胜者（13-14节）。\n第5节原文以「因为」（英文ESV译本）开始，表明5-14节是解释为什么神的儿子「远超过天使」（4节）。\n第5节引用了犹太人都接受的两节旧约弥赛亚预言：\n「祢是我的儿子，我今日生祢」（5节），引自诗二7弥赛亚诗篇。\n「我要作祂的父，祂要作我的子」（5节），引自撒下七14大卫之约。\n虽然天使也被称为「神的众子」（伯一6；诗二十九1），但他们都是受造之物。只有神的儿子才是被生的（5节），与神是在生命里的连结、并不是受造之物（西一15）。天使只是传递生命信息的使者，而神的儿子却是生命本身（约十一25；十四6）；神儿子把真正的生命显明在人面前，惟有祂才能叫人「得生命」（约五40；十10；二十31）。\n「神使长子到世上来」（6节），引自神对弥赛亚的应许：「我也要立祂为长子，为世上最高的君王」（诗八十九27）。\n「长子」指神的儿子复活之后的尊贵地位（出四22）。祂原是神的独生子（约一18），但因着祂的死而复活，让所有信祂的人都得着「长子」的尊贵地位，来到「有名录在天上诸长子之会所共聚的总会」（十二23）。\n「长子」也表明神的儿子超越的地位，祂不仅是「首生者」（西一15），也是「从死里首先复生的」（西一18），「在许多弟兄中作长子」（罗八29），配「在凡事上居首位」（西一18）。\n「神的使者都要拜祂」（6节），引自申三十二43：「诸天啊，当与祂一同欢乐；神的众子都要拜祂」（七十士译本、死海古卷、英文ESV译本），证明神儿子的神性。神差祂的儿子到地上来，不只是作传福音的使者，而且是要「叫一切在天上的、地上的，和地底下的，因耶稣的名无不屈膝，无不口称『耶稣基督为主』，使荣耀归与父神」（腓二9-11）。\n\rJesus in the Old Testment Psa 2:7-8 ESV 7 I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you.\n8 Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.\nProverbs 8 ESV\nWhat God Said Hebrews 1:5-12 NLT\n5 For God never said to any angel what he said to Jesus:\n“You are my Son.Today I have become your Father.” God also said, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son.”\n6 And when he brought his supreme Son into the world, God said,\n“Let all of God’s angels worship him.”\n7 Regarding the angels, he says,\n“He sends his angels like the winds, his servants like flames of fire.”\n8 But to the Son he says,\n“Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever. You rule with a scepter of justice.\n9 You love justice and hate evil.\nTherefore, O God, your God has anointed you, pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.”\n10 He also says to the Son,\n“In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundation of the earth and made the heavens with your hands.\n11 They will perish, but you remain forever.\nThey will wear out like old clothing.\n12 You will fold them up like a cloak\nand discard them like old clothing. But you are always the same; you will live forever.”\n Hebrews 1:5-12 NASB95\n5 For to which of the angels did He ever say,\n“You are My Son, Today I have fathered You”? And again, “I will be a Father to Him And He will be a Son to Me”?\n6 And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says,\n“And let all the angels of God worship Him.”\n7 And regarding the angels He says,\n“He makes His angels winds, And His ministers a flame of fire.”\n8 But regarding the Son He says,\n“Your throne, God, is forever and ever, And the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of His kingdom.\n9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;\nTherefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of joy above Your companions.”\n10 And, “You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the works of Your hands;\n11 They will perish, but You remain;\nAnd they all will wear out like a garment,\n12 And like a robe You will roll them up;\nLike a garment they will also be changed.But You are the same, And Your years will not come to an end.”\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/101_Matthew/Mat_01/","title":"Matthew 1","section":"Matthew","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r\r"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/127_Revelation/Revelation_01/","title":"Revelation 01","section":"Revelation","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:\n1:2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.\n1:3 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.\n1:4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;\n1:5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.

You guard all that is mine. \u0026#8617;\n[3] Brother L: 在基督里拣选的我们是那些在基督耶稣里有忠心的人。\u0026#8617;\n[4] 神在基督里的救恩是全备充足的，无论是重生得救、还是生命成长，都不需要我们用基督之外的事物来补足，只需「顺着圣灵而行」（加五16）。 \u0026#8617;\n[5] 「奥秘」（9节）指神在旧约里还没有完全启示，但在新约里已经启示的旨意。神不要我们作胡涂人，祂喜欢我们明白祂的旨意（五17）。 Brother M.Y.: It is easy for me to focus on my problems, because we are tend to be self-centered, and difficult for me to understand I am a part of God's plan. I need to pray for others, preach gospel. ... [2022-10-02, LBC] \u0026#8617;\n[6] 神的恩典不单是拣选我们（4节）、赦免我们（7节），使我们成为祂的儿女（5节），也是光照我们，「叫我们知道祂旨意的奥秘」（10-12节）。 神旨意的第一个目的，是让我们成为基督的样式，使万有「都在基督里面同归于一」（10节）。 「同归于一」（10节）原文用来形容把事物收集起来，以一整体的形式展示，比如希腊人习惯把一列数字加起来的总和写在该栏的顶端，演说家习惯在最后用摘要来总结每个部分与整个论点的关系。这字在本节中包含了三个概念：恢复、合一、基督为首。万物都是「在基督里面」被造的（西一16），虽然现在还充满堕落和混乱，但神的旨意是最后使万物顺服基督为唯一元首，恢复原有的功用（西一20）。 「天上、地上、一切所有的」（10节）在希腊文里代表万有，包括属灵和属物质的受造物。唯有基督有能力、也必然会使万物和好、同归于一，「在基督里面」（10节）万事都有真正的地位，都能合而为一，因此「在基督里面」的人生不分圣、俗。本节并非指所有人至终都会得救，神的恩典只有祂所拣选的人才能凭信心领受（4节）。 \u0026#8617;\n[7] 神旨意的第二个目的，是要我们「借着耶稣基督得儿子的名分」（5节），因此有权利在基督里得着神为我们预备的「基业」（11、14节），我们自己也成为神「在圣徒中得的基业」（18节），也就是属神的「子民」（出十九5）。「子民」（出十九5）原文就是「产业」。\u0026#8617;\n[8] 神旨意的第三个目的，是要使祂自己的荣耀「得着称赞」（12节）。「首先在基督里有盼望的人」（12节）可能指最早信主的一批信徒，主要是犹太人。\u0026#8617;\n[9] 「印记」指古时物主在信件或物品上所做的私人记号，证明谁是信件或物品的主人。圣灵是确认我们属神的「印记」（罗八15-16；加四6），因此我们应当顺服圣灵在凡事上的管理、引导、感动，使世人能看出我们是属神的。当一个人悔改相信归向神的同时，也就是他受圣灵的时候。\u0026#8617;\n[10] 圣灵的启示不但叫我们「真知道」神的所是，也照明我们「心中的眼睛」（18节），让我们「真知道」神的所作（18-23节）： 第一是「祂的恩召有何等指望」（18节），因为我们里面有圣灵作为「凭据」（14节），使我们被这荣耀的盼望（来二10）所吸引，这盼望就决定了我们今生的人生态度（约壹三2-3）。 第二是「祂在圣徒中得的基业有何等丰盛的荣耀」（18节），神呼召我们，不只是让我们重生得救，承受祂的「基业」（14节），更要我们长成基督的样式，被建造成基督的「身体」教会（23节）， 这渐渐长成的「主的圣殿」（二21）是神荣耀的「基业」（出十九5），是让神心满意足、得着安息的「家」（二19）。 第三是「祂向我们这信的人所显的能力是何等浩大」（19节），这能力是复活的能力（20节），神曾经运用在基督的身上，使基督复活、升高，如今要照样运用在信徒身上。 \u0026#8617;\n Ephesians第1章逐节注解、祷读\nNLT uses \u0026ldquo;the authority of Christ\u0026rdquo;.\n‪Ephesians‬1:10 NLT 10 And

大卫王年纪老迈、虽用被遮盖、仍不觉暖。\n1:2 所以臣仆对他说、不如为我主我王寻找一个处女、使他伺候王、奉养王、睡在王的怀中、好叫我主我王得暖。\n1:3 于是在以色列全境寻找美貌的童女、寻得书念的一个童女亚比煞、就带到王那里。\n1:4 这童女极其美貌、他奉养王、伺候王、王却没有与他亲近。\n1:5 那时、哈及的儿子亚多尼雅自尊、说、我必作王、就为自己预备车辆、马兵、又派五十人在他前头奔走。\n1:6 他父亲素来没有使他忧闷、说、你是作甚么呢。他甚俊美、生在押沙龙之后。\n1:7 亚多尼雅与洗鲁雅的儿子约押、和祭司亚比亚他商议。二人就顺从他、帮助他。\n1:8 但祭司撒督、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅、先知拿单、示每、利以、并大卫的勇士、都不顺从亚多尼雅。\n1:9

你进去见大卫王、对他说、我主我王阿、你不曾向婢女起誓说、你儿子所罗门必接续我作王、坐在我的位上么。现在亚多尼雅怎么作了王呢。\n1:14 你还与王说话的时候、我也随后进去、证实你的话。\n1:15 拔示巴进入内室见王、王甚老迈、书念的童女亚比煞正伺候王。\n1:16 拔示巴向王屈身下拜。王说、你要甚么。\n1:17 他说、我主阿、你曾向婢女指着耶和华你的　神起誓说、你儿子所罗门必接续我作王、坐在我的位上。\n1:18 现在亚多尼雅作王了、我主我王却不知道。\n1:19 他宰了许多牛羊、肥犊、请了王的众子、和祭司亚比亚他、并元帅约押、惟独王的仆人所罗门、他没有请。\n1:20 我主我王阿、以色列众人的眼目都仰望你、等你晓谕他们、在我主我王之后、谁坐你的位。\n1:21 若不然、到我主我王与列祖同睡以后、我和我儿子所罗门、必算为罪人了。\n1:22 拔示巴还与王说话的时候、先知拿单也进来了。\n1:23 有人奏告王说、先知拿单来了。拿单进到王前、脸伏于地。\n1:24 拿单说、我主我王果然应许亚多尼雅说、你必接续我作王、坐在我的位上么。\n1:25 他今日下去、宰了许多牛羊、肥犊、请了王的众子和军长、并祭司亚比亚他、他们正在亚多尼雅面前吃喝、说、愿亚多尼雅王万岁。\n1:26 惟独我、就是你的仆人、和祭司撒督、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅、并王的仆人所罗门、他都没有请。\n1:27 这事果然出乎我主我王么、王却没有告诉仆人们、在我主我王之后、谁坐你的位。\n1:28 大卫王吩咐说、叫拔示巴来、拔示巴就进来站在王面前。\n1:29 王起誓说、我指着救我性命脱离一切苦难、永生的耶和华起誓、\n1:30 我既然指着耶和华以色列的　神向你起誓、说、你儿子所罗门必接续我作王、坐在我的位上、我今日就必照这话而行。\n1:31 于是拔示巴脸伏于地、向王下拜、说、愿我主大卫王万岁。\n1:32 大卫王又吩咐说、将祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅召来、他们就都来到王面前。\n1:33 王对他们说、要带领你们主的仆人、使我儿子所罗门骑我的骡子、送他下到基训。\n1:34 在那里祭司撒督、和先知拿单要膏他作以色列的王。你们也要吹角、说、愿所罗门王万岁。\n1:35 然后要跟随他上来、使他坐在我的位上、接续我作王。我已立他作以色列和犹大的君。\n1:36 耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅、对王说、阿们。愿耶和华我主我王的　神、也这样命定。\n1:37 耶和华怎样与我主我王同在、愿他照样与所罗门同在、使他的国位、比我主大卫王的国位更大。\n1:38 于是祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅、和基利提人、比利提人、都下去使所罗门骑大卫王的骡子、将他送到基训。\n1:39 祭司撒督、就从帐幕中取了盛膏油的角来、用膏膏所罗门。人就吹角、众民都说、愿所罗门王万岁。\n1:40 众民跟随他上来、且吹笛、大大欢呼、声音震地。\n1:41 亚多尼雅和所请的众客筵宴方毕、听见这声音。约押听见角声就说、城中为何有这响声呢。\n1:42 他正说话的时候、祭司亚比亚他的儿子约拿单来了、亚多尼雅对他说、进来吧、你是个忠义的人、必是报好信息。\n1:43 约拿单对亚多尼雅说、我们的主大卫王、诚然立所罗门为王了。\n1:44 王差遣祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅、和基利提人、比利提人、都去使所罗门骑王的骡子。\n1:45 祭司撒督和先知拿单、在基训已经膏他作王。众人都从那里欢呼着上来、声音使城震动、这就是你们所听见的声音。\n1:46 并且所罗门登了国位。\n1:47 王的臣仆也来为我们的主大卫王祝福、说、愿王的　神使所罗门的名、比王的名更尊荣、使他的国位、比王的国位更大。王就在床上屈身下拜。\n1:48 王又说、耶和华以色列的　神是应当称颂的、因他赐我一人今日坐在我的位上、我也亲眼看见了。\n1:49 亚多尼雅的众客听见这话、就都惊惧、起来四散。\n1:50 亚多尼雅惧怕所罗门、就起来、去抓住祭坛的角。\n1:51 有人告诉所罗门说、亚多尼雅惧怕所罗门王、现在抓住祭坛的角、说、愿所罗门王今日向我起誓、必不用刀杀仆人。\n1:52 所罗门说、他若作忠义的人、连一根头发也不至落在地上。他若行恶、必要死亡。\n1:53 于是所罗门王差遣人、使亚多尼雅从坛上下来、他就来向所罗门王下拜、所罗门对他说、你回家去吧。\n

先前满有人民的城、现在何竟独坐、先前在列国中为大的、现在竟如寡妇。先前在诸省中为王后的、现在成为进贡的。\n1:2 他夜间痛哭、泪流满腮。在一切所亲爱的中间、没有一个安慰他的。他的朋友、都以诡诈待他、成为他的仇敌。1\n1:3 犹大因遭遇苦难、又因多服劳苦、就迁到外邦。他住在列国中、寻不着安息。追逼他的都在狭窄之地将他追上。\n1:4 锡安的路径、因无人来守圣节就悲伤。他的城门凄凉、他的祭司叹息。他的处女受艰难、自己也愁苦。2\n1:5 他的敌人为首。他的仇敌亨通。因耶和华为他许多的罪过、使他受苦。他的孩童被敌人掳去。3\n1:6 锡安城的威荣〔城原文作女子下同〕、全都失去。他的首领、像找不着草场的鹿、在追赶的人前、无力行走。\n1:7 耶路撒冷在困苦窘迫之时、就追想古时一切的乐境。他百姓落在敌人手中、无人救济。敌人看见、就因他的荒凉嗤笑。\n1:8 耶路撒冷大大犯罪。所以成为不洁之物。素来尊敬他的、见他赤露就都藐视他。他自己也叹息退后。\n1:9 他的污秽是在衣襟上。他不思想自己的结局。所以非常的败落、无人安慰他。他说、耶和华阿、求你看我的苦难、因为仇敌夸大。\n1:10 敌人伸手、夺取他的美物。他眼见外邦人进入他的圣所。论这外邦人你曾吩咐不可入你的会中。\n1:11 他的民都叹息、寻求食物。他们用美物换粮食、要救性命。他们说、耶和华阿、求你观看、因为我甚是卑贱。\n1:12 你们一切过路的人哪、这事你们不介意么。你们要观看、有像这临到我的痛苦没有、就是耶和华在他发烈怒的日子使我所受的苦。\n1:13 他从高天使火进入我的骨头、克制了我。他铺下网罗、绊我的脚、使我转回。他使我终日凄凉发昏。\n1:14 我罪过的轭、是他手所绑的、犹如轭绳缚在我颈项上。他使我的力量衰败。主将我交在我所不能敌挡的人手中。\n1:15 主轻弃我中间的一切勇士、招聚多人〔原文作大会〕攻击我、要压碎我的少年人。主将犹大居民踹下、像在酒醡中一样。\n1:16 我因这些事哭泣。我眼泪汪汪。因为那当安慰我、救我性命的、离我甚远。我的儿女孤苦、因为仇敌得了胜。\n1:17 锡安举手、无人安慰。耶和华论雅各已经出令、使四围的人作他仇敌。耶路撒冷在他们中间、像不洁之物。\n1:18 耶和华是公义的。他这样待我、是因我违背他的命令。众民哪、请听我的话、看我的痛苦、我的处女和少年人、都被掳去。\n1:19 我招呼我所亲爱的、他们却愚弄我。我的祭司和长老、正寻求食物救性命的时候、就在城中绝气。\n1:20 耶和华阿、求你观看、因为我在急难中。我心肠扰乱。我心在我里面翻转。因我大大悖逆。在外刀剑使人丧子、在家犹如死亡。\n1:21 听见我叹息的有人。安慰我的却无人。我的仇敌、都听见我所遭的患难。因你作这事他们都喜乐。你必使你报告的日子来到、他们就像我一样。\n1:22 愿他们的恶行、都呈在你面前。你怎样因我的一切罪过待我、求你照样待他们。因我叹息甚多、心中发昏。4 #    锡安离弃了那位安慰她、拯救她的真神（16节），转而倚靠外邦、投靠偶像。现在，当她「困苦窘迫」（7）、最需要帮助的时候，却发现求助无门、「无人安慰」。 「安慰 נָחַם/naw-kham’」（2节）是本诗的关键词，一共出现了五次（2、9、16、17、21节）。耶路撒冷所需要的「安慰」，并不是有人拉着她的手表示同情，而是实际地带来希望和帮助，这种「安慰」只能来自弥赛亚（16节；赛四十1）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「叹息 אָנַח/aw-nakh’」（4节）是本诗的另一个关键词，一共出现了五次（4、8、11、21、22节），叹息之中带着自责。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 耶路撒冷遭难，表面上是因为「她的仇敌亨通」（5节），好像外邦的偶像胜过了真神，实际上是「因耶和华为她许多的罪过使她受苦」（5节）。因此，我们不但要从顺境中看到神的作为，也要从逆境和仇敌的肆虐中看到神的心意。我们若不坚持自以为义、辩解自己无辜，而是承认神为我们的罪过使我们受苦，就能成为管教之中生命的转机。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 本诗充满了绝望的呼喊，百姓「无人救济」（7节）、「无人安慰」（2、9、17、21节），「在急难中」（20节）心肠扰乱、内心翻转。但绝望能驱使浪子踏上回家之路（路十五17），也能引导百姓迷途知返。耶路撒冷的可怕遭遇和绝望境地，实际上都是摩西早已预言的背约咒诅（申二十八15-16）。神早已不断「差遣祂的仆人众先知」（耶二十五4）发出警告，只是骄傲自恃的百姓（耶十三9）「没有听从，也没有侧耳而听」（耶二十五4），对警告无动于衷，所以无药可救地成了「不听从耶和华——他们神的话、不受教训的国民」（耶七28）。现在，绝望的百姓终于不再自以为义，而是承认自己「大大悖逆」（20节），承认自己是为罪接受公义的刑罚（5、12、18、22节）。当神的「拔出、拆毁」（耶一10）达到目的的时候，祂的「建立、栽植」（耶一10）也就快到了；当人发现地上「无人安慰」的时候，神的「安慰」（16节）也就不远了。\n耶利米哀歌第1章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

），当人以为自己最稳妥、最富足、最聪明的时候，往往就是败坏的开始。以扫是属肉体的人（创二十五32），他的后裔以东人是肉体生命的典型，目中无神，自以为可以「高飞」（4节），但神「必从那里拉下你来」（4节），使他们「在列国中为最小的，被人大大藐视」（2节）。\n以东「狂傲自欺」（3节）、自以为聪明（8节），却对存心「设下网罗」（7节）陷害自己的盟友毫无防备。今天，属肉体的世人也自以为聪明，不知道自己在地上所倚赖的，都会成为捆绑自己的「网罗」；结果聪明反被聪明误，「心里毫无聪明」（7节）。\n以东人通过南来北往的商旅收集了各样的知识。「提幔」（9节）位于以东境内（创三十六11），是约伯的朋友以利法的家乡（

我却要降火在推罗的城内、烧灭其中的宫殿。\n1:11 耶和华如此说、以东三番四次的犯罪、我必不免去他的刑罚。因为他拿刀追赶兄弟、毫无怜悯、发怒撕裂、永怀忿怒。\n1:12 我却要降火在提幔、烧灭波斯拉的宫殿。\n1:13 耶和华如此说、亚扪人三番四次的犯罪、我必不免去他们的刑罚。因为他们剖开基列的孕妇、扩张自己的境界。\n1:14 我却要在争战呐喊的日子、旋风狂暴的时候、点火在拉巴的城内、烧灭其中的宫殿。\n1:15 他们的王和首领必一同被掳去。这是耶和华说的。\n  主前733-732年，亚述王提革拉·毗列色三世发动第二次西征，征服了亚扪，应验了阿摩司的预言。\n阿摩司用同样的模式，发表了神对北国以色列周围七个国家的审判。每个审判，都是以「耶和华如此说」开始，宣告他们「三次犯罪，第四次我必不收回刑罚」（3、6、9、11、13节；二1、4）。神用「丰富的恩慈、宽容、忍耐」（罗二4）领人悔改，人却藐视神的恩典，继续作恶，任着自己「刚硬不悔改的心，为自己积蓄忿怒」（罗二5），结果神「必不收回刑罚」。每个「刑罚」都是从上而下，先是「降火、烧灭」君王所倚赖和自豪的「宫殿」（4、7、10、12、14节；二2、5），然后刑罚平民百姓；因为有什么样的百姓，就有什么样的君王。\n神要向北国说话，却先从她周围的列国说起（一3-二5）。从一3到二5，神首先发表了对北国以色列7个邻国的审判：亚兰、非利士、腓尼基、以东、亚扪、摩押和南国犹大。从外邦人（一3-二3）一直说到选民（二4-5），最后才说到北国以色列（二6-16）。神在本章中对5个外邦国家的审判，原因都是因为他们对付神的百姓（3、6、9、11、13节）。谴责仇敌的不义、宣讲对仇敌的审判，自然是百姓喜闻乐见的。阿摩司如果继续这样讲下去，可能很快就会成为北国广受欢迎的先知。不料，到了最后，百姓所听到的却是对自己的审判（二6-16），神宣告：「我民以色列的结局已经到了，我必不再宽恕他们」（八2）！\n今天，信徒听道，也常常觉得台上的信息正好适合自己所认识的某某人，如果某人在场就好了。但正如神对每个邻国的审判，实际上都是向北国宣告的，要让他们看到：神不但是以色列的神，也是外邦人的神；不但是北国的神，也是南国的神。「神不偏待人」（罗二11），祂「按各人行为审判人」（彼前一17），每一个国家、个人都要为自己的行为向神交账，没有人有犯罪的特权。因此，听道的人不要为别人而听，因为神的话语是要让每个罪人都扎心。\n阿摩司书第1章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

我也给司提反家施过洗。此外给别人施洗没有、我却记不清。\n1:17 基督差遣我、原不是为施洗、乃是为传福音。并不用智慧的言语、免得基督的十字架落了空。\n1:18 因为十字架的道理、在那灭亡的人为愚拙。在我们得救的人却为　神的大能。\n1:19 就如经上所记、『我要灭绝智慧人的智慧、废弃聪明人的聪明。』 1:20 智慧人在那里。文士在那里。这世上的辩士在那里。　神岂不是叫这世上的智慧变成愚拙么。\n1:21 世人凭自己的智慧、既不认识　神、　神就乐意用人所当作愚拙的道理、拯救那些信的人。这就是　神的智慧了。\n1:22 犹太人是要神迹、希利尼人是求智慧。\n1:23 我们却是传钉十字架的基督、在犹太人为绊脚石、在外邦人为愚拙、 1:24 但在那蒙召的、无论是犹太人、希利尼人、基督总为　神的能力、　神的智慧。\n1:25 因　神的愚拙总比人智慧。　神的软弱总比人强壮。\n1:26 弟兄们哪、可见你们蒙召的、按着肉体有智慧的不多、有能力的不多、有尊贵的也不多。\n1:27 神却拣选了世上愚拙的、叫有智慧的羞愧。又拣选了世上软弱的、叫那强壮的羞愧。\n1:28 神也拣选了世上卑贱的、被人厌恶的、以及那无有的、为要废掉那有的。\n1:29 使一切有血气的、在　神面前一个也不能自夸。\n1:30 但你们得在基督耶稣里、是本乎　神、　神又使他成为我们的智慧、公义、圣洁、救赎。\n1:31 如经上所记、『夸口的当指着主夸口12345 。』\n   2022年04月22日 域多利华人宣道会：同心出发 01-04 刘志雄\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

בָּלַע/baw-lah’」和「拆毁 שָׁחַת /shaw-khath’」也是本诗的关键词，意义相似。「吞灭」在本书原文只在本章出现了五次（2节、5节x2、8节「毁灭」原文、16节），「拆毁」在本书原文只在本章出现了三次（5节、6节「毁坏」原文、8节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神「在仇敌面前收回右手」（3节），比喻神不再用大能和奇事保护锡安（赛三十七36）、为自己的百姓争战（申一30）。相反，神反而「站着举起右手」（4节），「张弓好像仇敌」（4节），「如仇敌吞灭以色列和锡安的一切宫殿」（5节）——因「他们竟悖逆，使主的圣灵担忧。祂就转作他们的仇敌，亲自攻击他们」（赛六十三10）。今天，「凡想要与世俗为友的，就是与神为敌了」（雅四4），因为「圣灵和肉体相争，这两个彼此敌对」（加五17）。因此，凡是被神拣选的人，肉体一定会经历十字架的对付和圣灵的拆毁。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「他们在耶和华的殿中喧嚷，像在圣会之日一样」（7节），指得胜的敌军在圣殿中喧嚷，在神的耳中就像背弃圣约的百姓在「圣会之日」的敬拜一样。今天，许多有名无实的「表演式敬拜」，也许在神面前还不如世界的大型演唱会。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 百姓以为「耶和华的殿」（耶七4）可以确保自己平安，所以活在虚假的选民优越感里，却完全忽视立约之民的属灵责任。因此，人在神之外倚靠什么，神就会拆毁什么。但是，当神的拆毁临到时，不但犹大的保障被倾覆（2节）、荣耀的锡安被拆毁（8-10节），圣殿也遭到仇敌的玷污（7节）；表面被拆毁的是背约的百姓（2-5节），实际付代价的却是立约的神（6节）。同样，当我们的肉体被神拆毁的时候，表面上是人背起了自己的十字架（太十六24），实际上是主与我们同负一轭，祂的轭是容易的，祂的担子是轻省的（太十一30）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 这些无辜儿童的不幸，并非因为神的管教残忍，而是因为他们的父母自私刚硬、自食其果。百姓不但没有殷勤教导孩子敬畏神（申六6-9），反而全家同心敬拜偶像（耶七18）、焚烧儿女献给巴力（耶十九5）；不但「不思想自己的结局」（一9），也不思考儿女的命运，反而屡次拒绝了神给的出路。今天，在许多号称基督教传统的国家里，婚姻异化、家庭破碎，父亲缺失、儿女自由，这是潮流、文化，还是堕落失败呢？应该抱怨、鼓励，还是回到圣经呢？\n神早就多次警告：「住在这城里的必遭刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫而死；但出去归降迦勒底人的必得存活」（耶三十八2），「但西底家和他的臣仆，并国中的百姓，都不听从耶和华借先知耶利米所说的话」（耶三十七2），对生死攸关的事情出奇地漠不关心。「天作孽，犹可违；自作孽，不可活」，所以诗人感叹：「锡安的民哪，我可拿什么和你比较，好安慰你呢」（13节）？因为锡安的「裂口大如海」（13节），没有人能用类似的经历来安慰她。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 假先知没有让百姓正视自己的罪孽，却不断宣扬虚假的平安（耶六14；八11；十四13；二十八2-4），使百姓失去认罪悔改、扭转命运的机会，所以假先知必然会被神审判。但锡安的悲剧，并不能把全部责任都推给假先知，因为有什么样的百姓，就有什么样的假先知为他们「见虚假和愚昧的异象」（14节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「人所称为全美的」（15节），引自诗五十2；「称为全地所喜悦的」，引自诗四十八2。诗四十八宣告仇敌「见了这城就惊奇丧胆，急忙逃跑。他们在那里被战兢疼痛抓住，好像产难的妇人一样」（诗四十八5-6），因为「神必坚立这城，直到永远」（诗四十八8）。但现在，仇敌却兴高采烈地说：「我们吞灭她。这真是我们所盼望的日子临到了！我们亲眼看见了」（16节）。而这种在人看来让神蒙羞的失败，竟然能让「耶和华成就了祂所定的，应验了祂古时所命定的」（17节）。神「把以色列的角全然砍断，在仇敌面前收回右手」（3节），却「使你的仇敌向你夸耀；使你敌人的角也被高举」（17节），这让我们不得不思想：许多只会求神安慰、医治、赐福、帮助的人，真的是认识那位自我启示的真神吗？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 在末世的今天，信徒也不是没有能力分辨真假先知，而是只要心中没有神的地位，「有敬虔的外貌，却背了敬虔的实意」（提后三5），安慰的话语就一定比扎心的信息更加迎合肉体，假先知也一定会比真教师更受欢迎。对于这样的信徒和教会，神也会「倾覆了，并不顾惜」（17节），因为拆毁了、才能重建。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「夜间，每逢交更的时候」（19节），原文是「夜间更次开始的时候」（英文ESV译本）。古代以色列的一夜分为三更，每更四个小时（士七19）。锡安的百姓晚上每隔四小时就向神哀求，「在主面前倾心如水」（19节），比喻祷告的迫切和真诚。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 虽然诗人描述了灾难的可怕，但却没有自以为义地指责神、抱怨世界不公不义，因为他知道这是神「发怒的日子」（1、21、22节）到了，施行拆毁的乃是神自己，百姓的悲剧是长期背弃圣约的结果——「他们所种的是风，所收的是暴风」（何八7）。但是，无论百姓怎样顽梗悖逆、罪有应得，都可以「为他们的性命向主举手祷告」（19节）、求神「观看」（20节）这一幕人间惨剧；因为，既然背约的咒诅（利二十六14-39；申二十八15-65）应验了，复兴的应许（利二十六40-45；申三十1-10）还会远吗？同样，无论信徒怎样失败不配、咎由自取，都可以在管教中仰望神的怜悯；因为神的应许是：「无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的」（罗八38-39）。\n耶利米哀歌第2章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

Take care to see while you proclaim your knowledge of the way of salvation, that you yourself are rooted and grounded by faith in God. Never rely on the clearness of your presentation, but as you give your explanation make sure that you are relying on the Holy Spirit. Rely on the certainty of God’s redemptive power, and He will create His own life in people.\nOnce you are rooted in reality, nothing can shake you. If your faith is in experiences, anything that happens is likely to upset that faith. But nothing can ever change God or the reality of redemption. Base your faith on that, and you are as eternally secure as God Himself. Once you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, you will never be moved again. That is the meaning of sanctification. God disapproves of our human efforts to cling to the concept that sanctification is merely an experience, while forgetting that even our sanctification must also be sanctified (see John 17:19). I must deliberately give my sanctified life to God for His service, so that He can use me as His hands and His feet.\n WISDOM FROM OSWALD CHAMBERS The emphasis to-day is placed on the furtherance of an organization; the note is, “We must keep this thing going.” If we are in God’s order the thing will go; if we are not in His order, it won’t.

[**William MacDonald's Commentary**] Having set forth the example of Christ in such brilliant luster, the apostle is now ready to press home the exhortation based on it. The Philippians had always obeyed Paul when he was present with them. Now much more in his absence, they should work out their own salvation with fear and trembling. Again we come to a passage of Scripture concerning which there has been much confusion. At the outset, we should be very clear that Paul is not teaching that salvation can be earned by works. Throughout his writings, he repeatedly emphasizes that salvation is not by works but by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. What then does the verse mean? I. It may mean that we are to work out the salvation which God has placed within us. God has given us eternal life as a free gift. We are to live it out by lives of practical holiness. II. Salvation here may mean the solution of their problem at Philippian. They had been plagued with squabbles and strife. The apostle has given them the remedy. Now they are to apply the remedy by having the mind of Christ. Thus they would work out their own salvation, or the solution of their difficulty. The salvation spoken of here is not that of the soul, but deliverance from the snares which would hinder the Christian from doing the will of God. In a similar vein, Vine describes it as the present entire experience of deliverance from evil. Salvation has many different meanings in the NT. We have already noticed that in Php 1:19 it means deliverance from prison. In Php 1:28 it refers to the eventual salvation of our bodies from the very presence of sin. The meaning in any particular case must be determined in part, at least, by the context. We believe that in this passage salvation means the solution of the problem that was vexing the Philippians, that is, their contentions. [**Matthew Henry's Commentary**] [魂的救恩] I. He exhorts them to diligence and seriousness in the Christian course: **Work out your own salvation**. It is the salvation of our souls (1Pe 1:9) [^2], and our eternal salvation (Heb 5:9) [^3], and contains deliverance from all the evils sin had brought upon us and exposed us to, and the possession of all good and whatsoever is necessary to our complete and final happiness. Observe, It concerns us above all things to secure the welfare of our souls: whatever becomes of other things, let us take care of our best interests. It is our own salvation, the salvation of our own souls. It is not for us to judge other people; we have enough to do to look to ourselves; and, though we must promote the common salvation (Jud 1:3) as much as we can, yet we must upon no account neglect our own. We are required to work out our salvation, *katergazesthe*. The word signifies working thoroughly at a thing, and taking true pains. Observe, We must be diligent in the use of all the means which conduce to our salvation. We must not only work at our salvation, by doing something now and then about it; but we must work out our salvation, by doing all that is to be done, and persevering therein to the end. Salvation is the great thing we should mind, and set our hearts upon; and we cannot attain salvation without the utmost care and diligence. He adds, With fear and trembling, that is, with great care and circumspection: “Trembling for fear lest you miscarry and come short. Be careful to do every thing in religion in the best manner, and fear lest under all your advantages you should so much as seem to come short,” Heb 4:1 [^4]. Fear is a great guard and preservative from evil. II. He urges this from the consideration of their readiness always to obey the gospel: “As you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, Php 2:12. You have been always willing to comply with every discovery of the will of God; and that in my absence as well as presence. You make it to appear that regard to Christ, and care of your souls, sway more with you than any mode of showing respect whatsoever.” They were not merely awed by the apostle's presence, but did it even much more in his absence. “And because it is God who worketh in you, do you work out your salvation. Work, for he worketh.” It should encourage us to do our utmost, because our labour shall not be in vain. God is ready to concur with his grace, and assist our faithful endeavours. Observe, Though we must use our utmost endeavours in working out our salvation, yet still we must go forth, and go on, in a dependence upon the grace of God. His grace works in us in a way suitable to our natures, and in concurrence with our endeavours; and the operations of God's grace in us are so far from excusing, that they are intended to quicken and engage our endeavours. “And work out our salvation with fear and trembling, for he worketh in you.” All our working depends upon his working in us. “Do not trifle with God by neglects and delays, lest you provoke him to withdraw his help, and all your endeavours prove in vain. Work with fear, for he works of his good pleasure.” - To will and to do: he gives the whole ability. It is the grace of God which inclines the will to that which is good: and then enables us to perform it, and to act according to our principles. Thou hast wrought all our works in us, Isa 26:12. Of his good pleasure. As there is no strength in us, so there is no merit in us. As we cannot act without God's grace, so we cannot claim it, nor pretend to deserve it. God's good will to us is the cause of his good work in us; and he is under no engagements to his creatures, but those of his gracious promise. [^2]: 彼前一9 并且得着你们信心的果效、就是灵魂的救恩。 (1Pe 1:9 KJV) Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. [^3]: 希五9 他既得以完全、就为凡顺从他的人、成了永远得救的根源。 (Heb 5:9 KJV) And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; [^4]: 希四1 我们既蒙留下有进入他安息的应许、就当畏惧、免得我们中间、〔我们原文作你们〕或有人似乎是赶不上了。 (Heb 4:1 KJV) Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. [**John MacArthur's Commentary**] **work out your own salvation** The Gr. verb rendered \"work out\" means \"to continually work to bring something to fulfillment or completion.\" It can't refer to salvation by works (cf. Rom. 3:21-24; Eph. 2:8-9), but it does refer to the believer's responsibility for active pursuit of obedience in the process of sanctification (see notes on 3:13,14; Rom 6:19; cf. 1Cor. 9:24-27; 15:58; 2Cor. 7:1; Gal. 6:7-9; Eph 4:1; Col. 3:1-17; Heb. 6:10, 11; 12:1,2; 2Pet. 1:5-11) **fear and trembling**. The attitude with which Christians are to pursue their sanctification. It involves a healthy fear of offending God and a rightous awe and respect for Him (cf. Prov. 1:7; 9:10; Is. 66:1,2).\r\u0026#8617;\n"},{"id":41,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/039_Malachi/Malachi_02/","title":"玛二章","section":"Malachi","content":"玛拉基书\n2:1 众祭司阿、这诫命是传给你们的。\n2:2

神第一次吩咐百姓「在锡安吹角」（1节），是为了报警，让「国中的居民都要发颤」（1节），好让他们「撕裂心肠」（13节）归向神。今天，我们若只敢传讲恩典、安慰，却不敢「吹出大声」（1节）、让人「发颤」，也不能让人真正「撕裂心肠」、悔改蒙福。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神在宣告审判的同时，也宣告了救恩的应许；在执行刑罚之前，先指出了得救的门路（12-14节），呼吁百姓「归向耶和华——你们的神」（13节），并提醒他们神在立约时自我启示的性情：「耶和华，耶和华，是有怜悯有恩典的神，不轻易发怒，并有丰盛的慈爱和诚实」（出三十四6）。\n「要撕裂心肠，不撕裂衣服」（13节），意思是内心的悔改比外表的伤痛更加重要，因为「神所要的祭就是忧伤的灵」（诗五十一17）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「后悔」（13、14节）原文的意思包括「遗憾、怜悯、同情、后悔、使舒坦」，这里可译为「减弱」（英文ESV、NASB译本）。「以色列的大能者必不致说谎，也不致后悔；因为祂迥非世人，决不后悔」（撒上十五29）。因此，神「后悔不降所说的灾」（13节）、「转意后悔」（14节），并不是说神的计划会根据人的反应而改变，因为「在祂并没有改变，也没有转动的影儿」（雅一17）；而是表明神「有恩典，有怜悯，不轻易发怒，有丰盛的慈爱」（13节），必定会向回转的百姓施行恩典。但神是全知的（诗一百三十九16），祂早就知道哪些人会回转归向祂（何三5）、哪些人不肯归向祂（何五4），不需要根据人的反应调整管教的力度。\n神愿意在审判之中「留下余福」（14节），是为了在审判之后恢复每日的献祭（一9、13），作为神与人恢复正常关系的标志。同样，神赐给我们恩典，并不是为了让我们在地上安逸满足，而是要用恩典带领我们正确地活在神面前。蒙恩的人若忽略了与神的关系，恩典就失去了意义，早晚会失去恩典。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 律法规定「新郎」（16节）可以有一年的时间免除兵役与公职（申二十四5），但神要求「新郎、新妇」也走出洞房，不管百姓有无义务、是否有罪，都要在神面前认罪悔改。今天，教会若出现了破口，全体都要悔改，没有人可以独善其身、自命清高，因为「若一个肢体受苦，所有的肢体就一同受苦；若一个肢体得荣耀，所有的肢体就一同快乐。你们就是基督的身子，并且各自作肢体」（林前十二26-27）。神所要的是「建立基督的身体」（弗四12），彰显团体的见证。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 17节不是祭司主动的祷告，而是神教导祭司如何祈求救恩。神不但赐给人救恩的应许和得救的门路（12-14节），也引导人用准确的祷告来支取救恩。这个祷告单单高举神的怜悯和荣耀，而不是标榜人的悔改和回转。神借着这个祷告启示我们：救恩完全是因着神主动的恩典，而不是因为人的悔改或努力，因为人连怎样祈求救恩都不会。因此，「神救了我们，以圣召召我们，不是按我们的行为，乃是按祂的旨意和恩典」（提后一9）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「耶和华应允祂的百姓说」（19节），原文是「耶和华将应允祂的百姓说」。因此，18-20节并不是神回应百姓已经作出的祷告，而是神应许祂将怎样回应百姓的祷告。人的祷告不可能改变神的心意，神之所以应允人的祷告（17节），是因为神主动预备了救恩，并且引导人用合神心意的祷告去支取（15-16节）。正如保罗所说的：「你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸」（弗二8-9）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 蝗虫不知情地执行神的管教，但却最终被神消灭（20节）。神对待那些被用来管教以色列的仇敌，不论是亚述（赛十5-19）还是巴比伦（哈二6-19），也是如此。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「以后」（28节），指第一阶段物质的恢复（18-27节）之后，神将开始第二阶段属灵的恢复（28-32节）。第一阶段是物质的「补还」（25节），第二阶段是属灵更新。物质的恢复是属灵恢复的证据与记号，神百姓的物质生活和属灵生活是密不可分的（赛三十二9-20）。\n「凡有血气的」（28节），在这里特指以色列人。\n「浇灌」（28节）原文是「倾倒」。在此之前，圣灵只降临在少数被神使用的人身上，如基甸（士六34）、参孙（士十四6）、扫罗（撒上十6）和大卫（撒上十六13）。但经过了蝗灾的重大管教和百姓的彻底回转，神不止要在物质上「补还」百姓（18-27节），更要将圣灵倾倒给「凡有血气的」的以色列余民，使他们有能力重新成为「祭司的国度」（出十九6），正如摩西所盼望的：「惟愿耶和华的百姓都受感说话！愿耶和华把他的灵降在他们身上」（民十一29）。\n教会的第一个五旬节，门徒们「都被圣灵充满」（徒二4），这是约珥的预言实现的开始（徒二15-18）。那时，使徒彼得宣告，圣灵也将赐给「一切在远方的人，就是主——我们神所召来的」（徒二39）外邦人。\n「说预言」、「做异梦」、「见异象」（28节），并不是说某种人只能用某种方式领受神的旨意，也不是说只有这三种方式能领受神的旨意，而是使用诗歌的对称手法，宣告圣灵将亲自引导「凡有血气的」百姓，不分尊卑（28节）和性别（29节）。这个预言的重点是宣告神将赐下圣灵，而不是谈圣灵的特殊工作。\n在希伯来圣经里，28-32节独立成为约珥书的第三章。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

and the earth.\n1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\n1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\n1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.\n1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\n1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\n1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.\n1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.\n1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\n1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.\n1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.\n1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:\n1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.\n1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.\n1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,\n1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.\n1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.\n1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.\n1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\n1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.\n1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\n1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\n1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\n1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.\n1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\n     Genesis Chapter 2\n2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.\n2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.\n2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,\n2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.\n2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.\n2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\n2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.\n2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.\n2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold:\n2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\n2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.\n2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.\n2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\n2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:\n2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\n2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.\n2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.\n2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.\n2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:\n2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.\n2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\n2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.\n     Genesis Chapter 3\n3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\n3:2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:\n3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.\n3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:\n3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\n3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.\n3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.\n3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.\n3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?\n3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\n3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\n3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\n3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\n3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:\n3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\n3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\n3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life:\n3:18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field:\n3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\n3:20 And Adam called his wife\u0026rsquo;s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.\n3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.\n3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:\n3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.\n3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\n     Genesis Chapter 4\n4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.\n4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\n4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.\n4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:\n4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.\n4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?\n4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\n4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\n4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother\u0026rsquo;s keeper?\n4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother\u0026rsquo;s blood crieth unto me from the ground.\n4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother\u0026rsquo;s blood from thy hand:\n4:12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\n4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.\n4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.\n4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\n4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.\n4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.\n4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.\n4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.\n4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.\n4:21 And his brother\u0026rsquo;s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.\n4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.\n4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\n4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\n4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.\n4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.\n     Genesis Chapter 5\n5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him:\n5:2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.\n5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:\n5:4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:\n5:5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\n5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:\n5:7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:\n5:8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.\n5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:\n5:10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:\n5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.\n5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:\n5:13 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:\n5:14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.\n5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:\n5:16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:\n5:17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.\n5:18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:\n5:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:\n5:20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.\n5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:\n5:22 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:\n5:23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:\n5:24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.\n5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:\n5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:\n5:27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.\n5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:\n5:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.\n5:30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:\n5:31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.\n5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n     Genesis Chapter 6\n6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,\n6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.\n6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\n6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.\n6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.\n6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.\n6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\n6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.\n6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.\n6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\n6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.\n6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.\n6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.\n6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.\n6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.\n6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.\n6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.\n6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.\n6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.\n     Genesis Chapter 7\n7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.\n7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.\n7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.\n7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.\n7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.\n7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.\n7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.\n7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,\n7:9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.\n7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.\n7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah\u0026rsquo;s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\n7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\n7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah\u0026rsquo;s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark:\n7:14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.\n7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.\n7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.\n7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.\n7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.\n7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.\n7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.\n7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:\n7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.\n7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\n7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.\n     Genesis Chapter 8\n8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged:\n8:2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained:\n8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.\n8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.\n8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.\n8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:\n8:7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.\n8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground:\n8:9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.\n8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark:\n8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.\n8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.\n8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.\n8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.\n8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,\n8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.\n8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.\n8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:\n8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.\n8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.\n8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man\u0026rsquo;s sake; for the imagination of man\u0026rsquo;s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.\n8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\n     Genesis Chapter 9\n9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\n9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.\n9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.\n9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.\n9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man\u0026rsquo;s brother will I require the life of man.\n9:6 Whoso sheddeth man\u0026rsquo;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.\n9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.\n9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,\n9:9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you:\n9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.\n9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.\n9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:\n9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.\n9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:\n9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.\n9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.\n9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\n9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.\n9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.\n9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:\n9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.\n9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.\n9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father\u0026rsquo;s nakedness.\n9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.\n9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\n9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\n9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.\n     Genesis Chapter 10\n10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.\n10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.\n10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\n10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\n10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\n10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.\n10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.\n10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.\n10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\n10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,\n10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.\n10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,\n10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.\n10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,\n10:16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,\n10:17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,\n10:18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.\n10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.\n10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.\n10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.\n10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.\n10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.\n10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.\n10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother\u0026rsquo;s name was Joktan.\n10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,\n10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,\n10:28 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,\n10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.\n10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.\n10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.\n10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.\n     Genesis Chapter 11 11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.\n11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.\n11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.\n11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\n11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.\n11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\n11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another\u0026rsquo;s speech.\n11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.\n11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\n11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:\n11:11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.\n11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:\n11:13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.\n11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:\n11:15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.\n11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:\n11:17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.\n11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:\n11:19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.\n11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:\n11:21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.\n11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:\n11:23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.\n11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:\n11:25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.\n11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\n11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.\n11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.\n11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram\u0026rsquo;s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor\u0026rsquo;s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.\n11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.\n11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son\u0026rsquo;s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram\u0026rsquo;s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.\n11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.\n     Genesis Chapter 12\n12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father\u0026rsquo;s house, unto a land that I will shew thee:\n12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:\n12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.\n12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.\n12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother\u0026rsquo;s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.\n12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.\n12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.\n12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.\n12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.\n12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.\n12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:\n12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.\n12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.\n12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.\n12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s house.\n12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.\n12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram\u0026rsquo;s wife.\n12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?\n12:19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.\n12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.\n     Genesis Chapter 13\n13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.\n13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\n13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai:\n13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.\n13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.\n13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.\n13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram\u0026rsquo;s cattle and the herdmen of Lot\u0026rsquo;s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.\n13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.\n13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\n13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.\n13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.\n13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.\n13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.\n13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:\n13:15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.\n13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.\n13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.\n13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.\n     Genesis Chapter 14\n14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations:\n14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.\n14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.\n14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.\n14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,\n14:6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.\n14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.\n14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim:\n14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.\n14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.\n14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.\n14:12 And they took Lot, Abram\u0026rsquo;s brother\u0026rsquo;s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.\n14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.\n14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.\n14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.\n14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.\n14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king\u0026rsquo;s dale.\n14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.\n14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:\n14:20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.\n14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.\n14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,\n14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:\n14:24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.\n     Genesis Chapter 15\n15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.\n15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?\n15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.\n15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.\n15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.\n15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\n15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.\n15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?\n15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.\n15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.\n15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.\n15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.\n15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years:\n15:14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.\n15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.\n15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\n15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.\n15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:\n15:19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,\n15:20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,\n15:21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\n     Genesis Chapter 16\n16:1 Now Sarai Abram\u0026rsquo;s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.\n16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\n16:3 And Sarai Abram\u0026rsquo;s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.\n16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.\n16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.\n16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.\n16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai\u0026rsquo;s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.\n16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.\n16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.\n16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.\n16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man\u0026rsquo;s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.\n16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?\n16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.\n16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son\u0026rsquo;s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.\n16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.\n     Genesis Chapter 17\n17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.\n17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.\n17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,\n17:4 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.\n17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.\n17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.\n17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.\n17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\n17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.\n17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.\n17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.\n17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.\n17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.\n17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.\n17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.\n17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.\n17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?\n17:18 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!\n17:19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.\n17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.\n17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.\n17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.\n17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham\u0026rsquo;s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.\n17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.\n17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.\n     Genesis Chapter 18\n18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day:\n18:2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,\n18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:\n18:4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:\n18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.\n18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.\n18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.\n18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.\n18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\n18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\n18:13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?\n18:14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.\n18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\n18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do:\n18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\n18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\n18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous:\n18:21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\n18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\n18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\n18:24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?\n18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n18:26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:\n18:28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.\n18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty\u0026rsquo;s sake.\n18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\n18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty\u0026rsquo;s sake.\n18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten\u0026rsquo;s sake.\n18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\n     Genesis Chapter 19\n19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground:\n19:2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant\u0026rsquo;s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.\n19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.\n19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:\n19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.\n19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,\n19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\n19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.\n19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.\n19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.\n19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\n19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:\n19:13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.\n19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.\n19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\n19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.\n19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\n19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:\n19:19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:\n19:20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.\n19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.\n19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven:\n19:25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.\n19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\n19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:\n19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.\n19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.\n19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:\n19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\n19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.\n19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.\n     Genesis Chapter 20\n20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\n20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man\u0026rsquo;s wife.\n20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?\n20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.\n20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\n20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.\n20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.\n20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.\n20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?\n20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife\u0026rsquo;s sake.\n20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\n20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father\u0026rsquo;s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.\n20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.\n20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.\n20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.\n20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.\n20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham\u0026rsquo;s wife.\n     Genesis Chapter 21\n21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.\n21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.\n21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.\n21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.\n21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.\n21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.\n21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.\n21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.\n21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.\n21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.\n21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham\u0026rsquo;s sight because of his son.\n21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.\n21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.\n21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.\n21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.\n21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.\n21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.\n21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.\n21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\n21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.\n21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.\n21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:\n21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son\u0026rsquo;s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\n21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.\n21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech\u0026rsquo;s servants had violently taken away.\n21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.\n21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.\n21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?\n21:30 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.\n21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.\n21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.\n21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\n21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.\n     Genesis Chapter 22\n22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.\n22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\n22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.\n22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.\n22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\n22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.\n22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\n22:8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.\n22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\n22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.\n22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\n22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.\n22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.\n22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.\n22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,\n22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:\n22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies:\n22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.\n22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.\n22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor:\n22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,\n22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham\u0026rsquo;s brother.\n22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\n     Genesis Chapter 23\n23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.\n23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\n23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,\n23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.\n23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n23:6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.\n23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.\n23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,\n23:9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.\n23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,\n23:11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.\n23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.\n23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.\n23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n23:15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.\n23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.\n23:17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.\n23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.\n23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.\n     Genesis Chapter 24\n24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.\n24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:\n24:3 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:\n24:4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.\n24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?\n24:6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.\n24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father\u0026rsquo;s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.\n24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.\n24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.\n24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.\n24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.\n24:12 And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.\n24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:\n24:14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.\n24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham\u0026rsquo;s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\n24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.\n24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.\n24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.\n24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.\n24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.\n24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.\n24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold:\n24:23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father\u0026rsquo;s house for us to lodge in?\n24:24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.\n24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.\n24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.\n24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master\u0026rsquo;s brethren.\n24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother\u0026rsquo;s house these things.\n24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.\n24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister\u0026rsquo;s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.\n24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.\n24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men\u0026rsquo;s feet that were with him.\n24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.\n24:34 And he said, I am Abraham\u0026rsquo;s servant.\n24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.\n24:36 And Sarah my master\u0026rsquo;s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.\n24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\n24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father\u0026rsquo;s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.\n24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.\n24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father\u0026rsquo;s house:\n24:41 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.\n24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:\n24:43 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink:\n24:44 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master\u0026rsquo;s son.\n24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.\n24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.\n24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor\u0026rsquo;s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.\n24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master\u0026rsquo;s brother\u0026rsquo;s daughter unto his son.\n24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.\n24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.\n24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master\u0026rsquo;s son\u0026rsquo;s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.\n24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham\u0026rsquo;s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.\n24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.\n24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.\n24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.\n24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.\n24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.\n24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham\u0026rsquo;s servant, and his men.\n24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.\n24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.\n24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.\n24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.\n24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.\n24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.\n24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\n24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah\u0026rsquo;s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother\u0026rsquo;s death.\n     Genesis Chapter 25\n25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.\n25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.\n25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.\n25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.\n25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.\n25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.\n25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham\u0026rsquo;s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.\n25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.\n25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre:\n25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.\n25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.\n25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham\u0026rsquo;s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah\u0026rsquo;s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:\n25:13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,\n25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,\n25:15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:\n25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.\n25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.\n25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.\n25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham\u0026rsquo;s son: Abraham begat Isaac:\n25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.\n25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.\n25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.\n25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.\n25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.\n25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.\n25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau\u0026rsquo;s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.\n25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.\n25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.\n25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:\n25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.\n25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.\n25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?\n25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.\n25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.\n     Genesis Chapter 26 26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.\n26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:\n26:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father:\n26:4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed:\n26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\n26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:\n26:7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.\n26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.\n26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.\n26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.\n26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\n26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.\n26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:\n26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.\n26:15 For all the wells which his father\u0026rsquo;s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.\n26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.\n26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.\n26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.\n26:19 And Isaac\u0026rsquo;s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.\n26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac\u0026rsquo;s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.\n26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.\n26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.\n26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.\n26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham\u0026rsquo;s sake.\n26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac\u0026rsquo;s servants digged a well.\n26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.\n26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?\n26:28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee:\n26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.\n26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.\n26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.\n26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac\u0026rsquo;s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.\n26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.\n26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:\n26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\n     Genesis Chapter 27 27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.\n27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:\n27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison:\n27:4 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.\n27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,\n27:7 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.\n27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.\n27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:\n27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.\n27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:\n27:12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.\n27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.\n27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.\n27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:\n27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:\n27:17 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?\n27:19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.\n27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.\n27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob\u0026rsquo;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\n27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau\u0026rsquo;s hands: so he blessed him.\n27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\n27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son\u0026rsquo;s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.\n27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.\n27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:\n27:28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:\n27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother\u0026rsquo;s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.\n27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\n27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son\u0026rsquo;s venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.\n27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.\n27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.\n27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.\n27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?\n27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?\n27:38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\n27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above:\n27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.\n27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.\n27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.\n27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran:\n27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother\u0026rsquo;s fury turn away:\n27:45 Until thy brother\u0026rsquo;s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?\n27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?\n     Genesis Chapter 28\n28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.\n28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother\u0026rsquo;s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother\u0026rsquo;s brother.\n28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people:\n28:4 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.\n28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob\u0026rsquo;s and Esau\u0026rsquo;s mother.\n28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan:\n28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram:\n28:8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father:\n28:9 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham\u0026rsquo;s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.\n28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\n28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.\n28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.\n28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed:\n28:14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\n28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.\n28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.\n28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\n28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.\n28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.\n28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,\n28:21 So that I come again to my father\u0026rsquo;s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:\n28:22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God\u0026rsquo;s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.\n     Genesis Chapter 29 29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.\n29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well\u0026rsquo;s mouth.\n29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well\u0026rsquo;s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well\u0026rsquo;s mouth in his place.\n29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.\n29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.\n29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.\n29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well\u0026rsquo;s mouth; then we water the sheep.\n29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father\u0026rsquo;s sheep: for she kept them.\n29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother\u0026rsquo;s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother\u0026rsquo;s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well\u0026rsquo;s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother\u0026rsquo;s brother.\n29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father\u0026rsquo;s brother, and that he was Rebekah\u0026rsquo;s son: and she ran and told her father.\n29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister\u0026rsquo;s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.\n29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.\n29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?\n29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.\n29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.\n29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.\n29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.\n29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.\n29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.\n29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.\n29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?\n29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.\n29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.\n29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.\n29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\n29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.\n29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.\n29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.\n29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.\n29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.\n     Genesis Chapter 30 30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.\n30:2 And Jacob\u0026rsquo;s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God\u0026rsquo;s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\n30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.\n30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.\n30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.\n30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.\n30:7 And Bilhah Rachel\u0026rsquo;s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.\n30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.\n30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.\n30:10 And Zilpah Leah\u0026rsquo;s maid bare Jacob a son.\n30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.\n30:12 And Zilpah Leah\u0026rsquo;s maid bare Jacob a second son.\n30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.\n30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son\u0026rsquo;s mandrakes.\n30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son\u0026rsquo;s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son\u0026rsquo;s mandrakes.\n30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son\u0026rsquo;s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.\n30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.\n30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.\n30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.\n30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.\n30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.\n30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:\n30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.\n30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.\n30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.\n30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.\n30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\n30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.\n30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?\n30:31 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.\n30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.\n30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.\n30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.\n30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\n30:36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban\u0026rsquo;s flocks.\n30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.\n30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.\n30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban\u0026rsquo;s cattle.\n30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.\n30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban\u0026rsquo;s, and the stronger Jacob\u0026rsquo;s.\n30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\n     Genesis Chapter 31\n31:1 And he heard the words of Laban\u0026rsquo;s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father\u0026rsquo;s; and of that which was our father\u0026rsquo;s hath he gotten all this glory.\n31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.\n31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\n31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,\n31:5 And said unto them, I see your father\u0026rsquo;s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.\n31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.\n31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\n31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.\n31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.\n31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.\n31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.\n31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\n31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father\u0026rsquo;s house?\n31:15 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.\n31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children\u0026rsquo;s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.\n31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels:\n31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.\n31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father\u0026rsquo;s.\n31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.\n31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.\n31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.\n31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?\n31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\n31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.\n31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father\u0026rsquo;s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?\n31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.\n31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.\n31:33 And Laban went into Jacob\u0026rsquo;s tent, and into Leah\u0026rsquo;s tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah\u0026rsquo;s tent, and entered into Rachel\u0026rsquo;s tent.\n31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel\u0026rsquo;s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.\n31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.\n31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?\n31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.\n31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.\n31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.\n31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\n31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.\n31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.\n31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?\n31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.\n31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.\n31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.\n31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:\n31:49 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.\n31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.\n31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:\n31:52 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.\n31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.\n31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.\n31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.\n     Genesis Chapter 32\n32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God\u0026rsquo;s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.\n32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.\n32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:\n32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.\n32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.\n32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands:\n32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.\n32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:\n32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.\n32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.\n32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother:\n32:14 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,\n32:15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.\n32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.\n32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?\n32:18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob\u0026rsquo;s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.\n32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.\n32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.\n32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.\n32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.\n32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.\n32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.\n32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob\u0026rsquo;s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.\n32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\n32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\n32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\n32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.\n32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\n32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.\n32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob\u0026rsquo;s thigh in the sinew that shrank.\n     Genesis Chapter 33\n33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.\n33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.\n33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.\n33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.\n33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.\n33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.\n33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.\n33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.\n33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.\n33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.\n33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.\n33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.\n33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.\n33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\n33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.\n33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.\n33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem\u0026rsquo;s father, for an hundred pieces of money.\n33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.\n     Genesis Chapter 34\n34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.\n34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.\n34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.\n34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.\n34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.\n34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.\n34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob\u0026rsquo;s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.\n34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.\n34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.\n34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.\n34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.\n34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.\n34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:\n34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:\n34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised:\n34:16 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.\n34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.\n34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor\u0026rsquo;s son.\n34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob\u0026rsquo;s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.\n34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,\n34:21 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.\n34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.\n34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.\n34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.\n34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah\u0026rsquo;s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.\n34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem\u0026rsquo;s house, and went out.\n34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.\n34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,\n34:29 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.\n34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.\n34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?\n     Genesis Chapter 35\n35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.\n35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:\n35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.\n35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.\n35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.\n35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.\n35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.\n35:8 But Deborah Rebekah\u0026rsquo;s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.\n35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.\n35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.\n35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins:\n35:12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.\n35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.\n35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.\n35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.\n35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.\n35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.\n35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.\n35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.\n35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel\u0026rsquo;s grave unto this day.\n35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.\n35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father\u0026rsquo;s concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:\n35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob\u0026rsquo;s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:\n35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:\n35:25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel\u0026rsquo;s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:\n35:26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah\u0026rsquo;s handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.\n35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\n35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.\n35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.\n     Genesis Chapter 36 36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.\n36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite:\n36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael\u0026rsquo;s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.\n36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel:\n36:5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.\n36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.\n36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.\n36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.\n36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:\n36:10 These are the names of Esau\u0026rsquo;s sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.\n36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.\n36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau\u0026rsquo;s son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau\u0026rsquo;s wife.\n36:13 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau\u0026rsquo;s wife.\n36:14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau\u0026rsquo;s wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.\n36:15 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,\n36:16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.\n36:17 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau\u0026rsquo;s son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau\u0026rsquo;s wife.\n36:18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau\u0026rsquo;s wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau\u0026rsquo;s wife.\n36:19 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.\n36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,\n36:21 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.\n36:22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan\u0026rsquo;s sister was Timna.\n36:23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.\n36:24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.\n36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.\n36:26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.\n36:27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.\n36:28 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.\n36:29 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,\n36:30 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.\n36:31 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.\n36:32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.\n36:33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.\n36:34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.\n36:35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.\n36:36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.\n36:37 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.\n36:38 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.\n36:39 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife\u0026rsquo;s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.\n36:40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,\n36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,\n36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,\n36:43 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.\n     Genesis Chapter 37 37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.\n37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father\u0026rsquo;s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.\n37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.\n37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.\n37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.\n37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:\n37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.\n37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.\n37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\n37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?\n37:11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.\n37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father\u0026rsquo;s flock in Shechem.\n37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.\n37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\n37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?\n37:16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.\n37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.\n37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.\n37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\n37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.\n37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.\n37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.\n37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him:\n37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.\n37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.\n37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?\n37:27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.\n37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.\n37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.\n37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?\n37:31 And they took Joseph\u0026rsquo;s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood:\n37:32 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son\u0026rsquo;s coat or no.\n37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son\u0026rsquo;s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.\n37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.\n37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.\n37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s, and captain of the guard.\n     Genesis Chapter 38 38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\n38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.\n38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.\n38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.\n38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.\n38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.\n38:7 And Er, Judah\u0026rsquo;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.\n38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother\u0026rsquo;s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\n38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother\u0026rsquo;s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.\n38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.\n38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father\u0026rsquo;s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father\u0026rsquo;s house.\n38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah\u0026rsquo;s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.\n38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.\n38:14 And she put her widow\u0026rsquo;s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.\n38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.\n38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?\n38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?\n38:18 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.\n38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.\n38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman\u0026rsquo;s hand: but he found her not.\n38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.\n38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.\n38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\n38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.\n38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.\n38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.\n38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.\n38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.\n38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.\n38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.\n     Genesis Chapter 39\n39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.\n39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.\n39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.\n39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.\n39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian\u0026rsquo;s house for Joseph\u0026rsquo;s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.\n39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph\u0026rsquo;s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.\n39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master\u0026rsquo;s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.\n39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master\u0026rsquo;s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand:\n39:9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\n39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\n39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.\n39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\n39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,\n39:14 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:\n39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.\n39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.\n39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:\n39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.\n39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.\n39:20 And Joseph\u0026rsquo;s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king\u0026rsquo;s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.\n39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph\u0026rsquo;s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.\n39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.\n     Genesis Chapter 40\n40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.\n40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.\n40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.\n40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.\n40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.\n40:7 And he asked Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s officers that were with him in the ward of his lord\u0026rsquo;s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?\n40:8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.\n40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me:\n40:10 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:\n40:11 And Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s hand.\n40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:\n40:13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.\n40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:\n40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.\n40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:\n40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.\n40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:\n40:19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.\n40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.\n40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s hand:\n40:22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.\n40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.\n     Genesis Chapter 41 41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.\n41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.\n41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.\n41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.\n41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.\n41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.\n41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\n41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.\n41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:\n41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard\u0026rsquo;s house, both me and the chief baker:\n41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.\n41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.\n41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.\n41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.\n41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.\n41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.\n41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:\n41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:\n41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:\n41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:\n41:21 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.\n41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:\n41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:\n41:24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.\n41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.\n41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.\n41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.\n41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.\n41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:\n41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land:\n41:31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.\n41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.\n41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.\n41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.\n41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.\n41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.\n41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.\n41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?\n41:39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:\n41:40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.\n41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.\n41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph\u0026rsquo;s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck:\n41:43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.\n41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\n41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph\u0026rsquo;s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.\n41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.\n41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.\n41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.\n41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.\n41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.\n41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father\u0026rsquo;s house.\n41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.\n41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.\n41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.\n41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.\n41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\n41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.\n     Genesis Chapter 42 42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?\n42:2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.\n42:3 And Joseph\u0026rsquo;s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.\n42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.\n42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.\n42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.\n42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\n42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.\n42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.\n42:11 We are all one man\u0026rsquo;s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.\n42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.\n42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.\n42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:\n42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.\n42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.\n42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.\n42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:\n42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:\n42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\n42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\n42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.\n42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.\n42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.\n42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man\u0026rsquo;s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.\n42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.\n42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack\u0026rsquo;s mouth.\n42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?\n42:29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,\n42:30 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.\n42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:\n42:32 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:\n42:34 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.\n42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man\u0026rsquo;s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.\n42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.\n42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.\n42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n     Genesis Chapter 43\n43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.\n43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.\n43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\n43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:\n43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\n43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?\n43:7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?\n43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.\n43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:\n43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.\n43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:\n43:12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:\n43:13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:\n43:14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.\n43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.\n43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.\n43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph\u0026rsquo;s house.\n43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph\u0026rsquo;s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.\n43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph\u0026rsquo;s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,\n43:20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:\n43:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man\u0026rsquo;s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.\n43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.\n43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.\n43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph\u0026rsquo;s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.\n43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.\n43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.\n43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?\n43:28 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.\n43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother\u0026rsquo;s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.\n43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.\n43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.\n43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.\n43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.\n43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.\n     Genesis Chapter 44\n44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men\u0026rsquo;s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man\u0026rsquo;s money in his sack\u0026rsquo;s mouth.\n44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack\u0026rsquo;s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.\n44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.\n44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?\n44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\n44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.\n44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:\n44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord\u0026rsquo;s house silver or gold?\n44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord\u0026rsquo;s bondmen.\n44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.\n44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.\n44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s sack.\n44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.\n44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph\u0026rsquo;s house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.\n44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?\n44:16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord\u0026rsquo;s servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.\n44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.\n44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord\u0026rsquo;s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.\n44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?\n44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\n44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.\n44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.\n44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\n44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.\n44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.\n44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man\u0026rsquo;s face, except our youngest brother be with us.\n44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:\n44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:\n44:29 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad\u0026rsquo;s life:\n44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\n44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.\n44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.\n44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.\n     Genesis Chapter 45\n45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.\n45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.\n45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.\n45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.\n45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.\n45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.\n45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\n45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.\n45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:\n45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children\u0026rsquo;s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:\n45:11 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.\n45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.\n45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.\n45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.\n45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.\n45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s house, saying, Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.\n45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan:\n45:18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.\n45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.\n45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.\n45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.\n45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.\n45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.\n45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.\n45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,\n45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob\u0026rsquo;s heart fainted, for he believed them not.\n45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:\n45:28 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.\n     Genesis Chapter 46\n46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.\n46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob.

And he said, I will do as thou hast said.\n47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed\u0026rsquo;s head.\n     Genesis Chapter 48\n48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.\n48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.\n48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,\n48:4 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.\n48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.\n48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.\n48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.\n48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph\u0026rsquo;s sons, and said, Who are these?\n48:9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.\n48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.\n48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.\n48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.\n48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel\u0026rsquo;s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel\u0026rsquo;s right hand, and brought them near unto him.\n48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim\u0026rsquo;s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh\u0026rsquo;s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.\n48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,\n48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.\n48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father\u0026rsquo;s hand, to remove it from Ephraim\u0026rsquo;s head unto Manasseh\u0026rsquo;s head.\n48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.\n48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.\n48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.\n48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.\n48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.\n     Genesis Chapter 49\n49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.\n49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob;

thy father\u0026rsquo;s children shall bow down before thee.\n49:9 Judah is a lion\u0026rsquo;s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion;

every one according to his blessing he blessed them.\n49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,\n49:30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.\n49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.\n49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.\n49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.\n     Genesis Chapter 50\n50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father\u0026rsquo;s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.\n50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.\n50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.\n50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,\n50:5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.\n50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.\n50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,\n50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father\u0026rsquo;s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.\n50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.\n50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.\n50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.\n50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:\n50:13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.\n50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\n50:15 And when Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.\n50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,\n50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.\n50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.\n50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?\n50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.\n50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.\n50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father\u0026rsquo;s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.\n50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim\u0026rsquo;s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph\u0026rsquo;s knees.\n50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.\n50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n"},{"id":44,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/123_1_John/1John_03/","title":"1 John 3","section":"1 John","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r3:1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.\n3:2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.\n3:3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.\n3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.\n3:5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.\n3:6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.\n3:7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.\n3:8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning.

3:1 我是因耶和华忿怒的杖、遭遇困苦的人。\n3:2 他引导我、使我行在黑暗中、不行在光明里。 (1)\n3:3 他真是终日再三反手攻击我。\n3:4 他使我的皮肉枯干。他折断〔或作压伤〕我的骨头。 (2)\n3:5 他筑垒攻击我、用苦楚〔原文作苦胆〕和艰难围困我。\n3:6 他使我住在幽暗之处、像死了许久的人一样。\n3:7 他用篱笆围住我、使我不能出去。他使我的铜链沉重。 (3)\n3:8 我哀号求救、他使我的祷告、不得上达。\n3:9 他用凿过的石头、挡住我的道。他使我的路弯曲。\n3:10 他向我如熊埋伏、如狮子在隐密处。\n3:11 他使我转离正路、将我撕碎、使我凄凉。\n3:12 他张弓将我当作箭靶子。\n3:13 他把箭袋中的箭、射入我的肺腑。\n3:14 我成了众民的笑话。他们终日以我为歌曲。\n3:15 他用苦楚充满我、使我饱用茵蔯。\n3:16 他又用沙石碜断我的牙、用灰尘将我蒙蔽。\n3:17 你使我远离平安。我忘记好处。\n3:18 我就说、我的力量衰败、我在耶和华那里、毫无指望。\n3:19 耶和华阿、求你记念我如茵蔯和苦胆的困苦窘迫。 (4)\n3:20 我心想念这些、就在里面忧闷。\n3:21 我想起这事、心里就有指望。\n3:22 我们不至消灭、是出于耶和华诸般的慈爱、是因他的怜悯、不至断绝。\n3:23 每早晨这都是新的。你的诚实、极其广大。[ (^5])\n3:24 我心里说、耶和华是我的分。因此、我要仰望他。\n3:25 凡等候耶和华、心里寻求他的、耶和华必施恩给他。 (5)\n3:26 人仰望耶和华、静默等候他的救恩、这原是好的。\n3:27 人在幼年负轭、这原是好的。\n3:28 他当独坐无言、因为这是耶和华加在他身上的。\n3:29 他当口贴尘埃、或者有指望。\n3:30 他当由人打他的腮颊。要满受凌辱。 (6)\n3:31 因为主必不永远丢弃人。\n3:32 主虽使人忧愁、还要照他诸般的慈爱发怜悯。\n3:33 因他并不甘心使人受苦、使人忧愁。\n3:34 人将世上被囚的、踹〔原文作压〕在脚下、 3:35 或在至高者面前屈枉人、\n3:36 或在人的讼事上、颠倒是非。这都是主看不上的。\n3:37 除非主命定、谁能说成就成呢。\n3:38 祸福不都出于至高者的口么。\n3:39 活人因自己的罪受罚、为何发怨言呢。 (7)\n3:40 我们当深深考察自己的行为、再归向耶和华。\n3:41 我们当诚心向天上的　神举手祷告。\n3:42 我们犯罪背逆、你并不赦免。 (8)\n3:43 你自被怒气遮蔽、追赶我们。你施行杀戮、并不顾惜。 (9)\n3:44 你以黑云遮蔽自己、以至祷告不得透入。 (10)\n3:45 你使我们在万民中成为污秽和渣滓。\n3:46 我们的仇敌、都向我们大大张口。\n3:47 恐惧和陷坑、残害和毁灭、都临近我们。\n3:48 因我众民遭的毁灭、我就眼泪下流如河。\n3:49 我的眼多多流泪、总不止息、 3:50 直等耶和华垂顾、从天观看。\n3:51 因我本城的众民、我的眼、使我的心伤痛。 (11)\n3:52 无故与我为仇的追逼我、像追雀鸟一样。\n3:53 他们使我的命在牢狱中断绝、并将一块石头抛在我身上。 (12)\n3:54 众水流过我头。我说、我命断绝了。\n3:55 耶和华阿、我从深牢中求告你的名。\n3:56 你曾听见我的声音。我求你解救、你不要掩耳不听。\n3:57 我求告你的日子、你临近我、说、不要惧怕。\n3:58 主阿、你伸明了我的冤。你救赎了我的命。 (13)\n3:59 耶和华阿、你见了我受的委屈。求你为我伸冤。\n3:60 他们仇恨我、谋害我、你都看见了。\n3:61 耶和华阿、你听见他们辱骂我的话、知道他们向我所设的计、 3:62 并那些起来攻击我的人、口中所说的话、以及终日向我所设的计谋。\n3:63 求你观看、他们坐下起来、都以我为歌曲。\n3:64 耶和华阿、你要按着他们手所作的、向他们施行报应。 (14)\n3:65 你要使他们心里刚硬、使你的咒诅临到他们。\n3:66 你要发怒追赶他们、从耶和华的天下除灭他们。 (15)\n \r  并非「人的尽头是神的开头」，因为神的工作在人还不知道的时候就开始了。「祂引导我，使我行在黑暗中，不行在光明里」（2节），亲自把我们领到「人的尽头」；祂为自己的名引导我们「行过死荫的幽谷」（诗二十三4），好让我们经历祂的同在（诗二十三4）、把我们带到生命中更加丰盛的草场（诗二十三5）。我们若是不肯跟着牧人「行过死荫的幽谷」，却始终停留在黑暗中，所受的苦就枉然了。\n「祂真是终日再三反手攻击我」（3节），表明诗人承认自己所遭遇的一切都是出于神。过去，百姓在埃及作奴仆，神「用大能的手和伸出来的膀臂」（申五15）将他们从那里领出来，与他们立约（出十九4-6）。现在，立约之民一面享受圣约的恩典、一面背弃圣约，所以神就「用伸出来的手，并大能的膀臂」（耶二十一5）亲自攻击他们。神用「永远的爱」（耶三十一３）爱自己的百姓，并不是用永无止境的安慰和宽容。无论是帮助的手、还是管教的手，都是神的工作。人若在黑暗中能看到神手的工作，生命就有了转机。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 每一个经历过神的「拔出、拆毁、毁坏、倾覆」（耶一10）的信徒，都可以从中找到共鸣，甚至也会感受到自己「远离平安」（17节）、「毫无指望」（18节），但也同样将经历神的「建立、栽植」（耶一10）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 当我们不愿祷告的时候，灵里已经陷入罪的监牢。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「耶和华啊，求祢记念我如茵陈和苦胆的困苦窘迫」（19节），这是本诗的转折点。尽管诗人的感受是「祂使我的祷告不得上达」（8节）、「我在耶和华那里毫无指望」（18节），但他实在从地上找不到任何出路，身外的一切都已被夺去（4-18节），所以苦难煎熬中不得不把眼光从自己（4节）、从难处（5节）、从环境（14节）转向神。\n人若停留在苦难里顾影自怜，不但会「远离平安、忘记好处」（17节），而且会觉得自己「力量衰败、毫无指望」（18节）。但是，当人在苦难中思想神的应许、凭信心求神记念自己「如茵陈和苦胆的困苦窘迫」（19节）时，就会经历一个意想不到的转变：一开始还「在里面忧闷」（20节），但很快「心里就有指望」（21节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 人若想每天仰望神新鲜的慈爱和怜悯（23-24节），就应当学会「等候耶和华」（25节）。「等候耶和华」既不在乎时间长短，也不在乎情辞迫切，而在乎等候的态度。真正「心里寻求祂的，耶和华必施恩给他」（25节）。而那些口里寻求神、心中却早有定意的人（耶三十八14-15；四十二5-6），并不能得着什么。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 26-30节说出了「等候耶和华」的人当有的态度：\n1) 等候神的人应当放下自己、心中平静安稳——「人仰望耶和华，静默等候祂的救恩，这原是好的」（26节），因为「你们得救在乎归回安息；你们得力在乎平静安稳」（赛三十15）。\n2) 等候神的人应当有颗愿意成长的心——「人在幼年负轭，这原是好的」（27节）。正如年轻人需要经历磨练才能成长，属灵的婴孩也需要经历管教才能成熟（来十二6）。神所允许的环境风浪，对灵命的成长是有好处的，我们不必急着挣脱。\n3) 等候神的人应当认识神的作为、甘心接受神的管教——「他当独坐无言，因为这是耶和华加在他身上的」（28节）。无论神加在我们身上什么轭，祂总是公义的，祂的应许和祂的审判一样实在（林后一20）。因此，我们不要挣扎、也不要辩解，而要寻求神的怜悯、学习该学的功课。正如大卫所说的：「因我所遭遇的是出于祢，我就默然不语」（诗篇三十九9）。\n4) 等候神的人应当谦卑降服在神的手下——「他当口贴尘埃，或者有指望」（29节）。大卫在示每落井下石的时候愿意自卑（撒下十六11-12），最终被神恢复；同样，「你们要自卑，服在神大能的手下，到了时候，祂必叫你们升高」（彼前五6）。\n5) 等候神的人应当停止肉体的手——「他当由人打他的腮颊，要满受凌辱」（30节），才能让神的手来做工，正如主耶稣的榜样（太二十六67；路二十二64；约十八22；十九3；赛五十6；彼前二21）。人若对神真有信心，就应当「不要自己伸冤，宁可让步，听凭主怒」（罗十二19）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 31-39节说出了「等候耶和华」的人对神当有的基本认识：\n1) 「主必不永远丢弃人」（31节），而是要永远得着人。因此，人可以失败、背约，神却永远信实守约，「祂总不撇下你，不灭绝你，也不忘记祂起誓与你列祖所立的约」（申四31），所以「主虽使人忧愁，还要照祂诸般的慈爱发怜悯」（32节）。神所允许的忧愁是带领我们进入救恩、经历怜悯的道路——「因为依着神的意思忧愁，就生出没有后悔的懊悔来，以致得救」（林后七10），所以「哀恸的人有福了！因为他们必得安慰」（太五4）。\n2) 「祂并不甘心使人受苦，使人忧愁」（33节）。因此，神管教的终点不是「拔出、拆毁、毁坏、倾覆」（一20），而是「建立、栽植」（一20）；不是忍辱负重，而是把我们的生命提升到高处，让荣耀、羞辱、恶名、美名都碰不着我们；不是停留在「受苦」和「忧愁」里，而是要「领我到宽阔之处」（诗十八19），得着真正的平安和喜乐。\n3) 一切不公不义「都是主看不上的」（36节）。一方面，神并不喜爱欺压弱者（34节）、屈枉正直（35节）、颠倒是非（36a）；但另一方面，凡事「除非主命定，谁能说成就成呢？祸福不都出于至高者的口吗」（37-38节），一切不公不义都是在神的主权之下发生（赛四十五7；摩三6）。因此，信靠祂的人应当耐心忍受，相信神必叫「万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处」（罗八28）。信徒即使受到不公义的对待，神也必会伸冤。\n4) 神绝不会无故惩罚人。因此，「活人因自己的罪受罚，为何发怨言呢」（39节；彼前二19-20）；相反，人若认识自己的罪、承认自己的罪，就是等候神的人经历神的慈爱和怜悯的起点（22、32节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 一个人若是认识到自己的罪（40-42节），也认识到自己与神之间已经被罪阻隔（43-45节），更认识到罪的可怕后果（46-51节），就是灵命苏醒的开始。人若觉得自己大体上是一个好人，有问题的都是别人；虽然「人非圣贤，孰能无过」，自己却罪不至死，所以神应该对自己好一点，这「便是以神为说谎的，祂的道也不在我们心里了」（约壹一10）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「祢自被怒气遮蔽」（43节）、「祢以黑云遮蔽自己」（43节），形容人的罪惹动了神的忿怒（耶七16-19），以致「神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上，就是那些行不义阻挡真理的人」（罗一18），成为神与罪人之间的阻隔，就像浓密的「黑云」、「以致祷告不得透入」（44节）。实际上，「耶和华的膀臂并非缩短，不能拯救，耳朵并非发沉，不能听见，但你们的罪孽使你们与神隔绝；你们的罪恶使祂掩面不听你们」（赛五十九2）。因此，罪人绝不可能倚靠自己的行为突破拦阻、自我拯救。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 虽然神「以黑云遮蔽自己，以致祷告不得透入」（44节），似乎「使我的祷告不得上达」（8节），但祂却不会拒绝人真诚的眼泪；而装腔作势的祷告，无论多么动听都不蒙垂听。「我的眼多多流泪，总不止息，直等耶和华垂顾，从天观看」（49-50节），表明人「若转向祂，祂必不转脸不顾你们」（代下三十9），因为神必不轻看「忧伤痛悔的心」（诗五十一17）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「我的眼，使我的心伤痛」（51节），表明先知眼见的犯罪恶果，引起了内心的伤痛，所以才能与众民认同（48节）、为百姓代祷。人若自称「用爱心说诚实话」（弗四15），但眼见的事实并没有使自己的内心「伤痛」，表明我们并非与罪人认同、而是自以为义、居高临下，等于「是说自己没有犯过罪，便是以神为说谎的，祂的道也不在我们心里了」（约壹一10）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神允许罪把我们追赶到令人窒息绝望的「牢狱中」（53节），就是要我们落到一无所有、一无所靠的地步，才能完全放下自己，「从深牢中求告」（55节）祂的名、「从深处」（诗一百三十1）向祂求告。\nThink of Pat\u0026rsquo;s grandson, David. Pray for him (2022.08.13)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 虽然神的怒气好像已经使祂与人隔绝（43-45节），也使祷告无法穿透（8、44节），但祂永远都会垂听真诚的祷告，因为神也应许：「你们要转向我，我就转向你们」(亚一3；玛三7；代下三十9；雅四8）。因此，虽然诗人担心神「掩耳不听」（56节），但只要「从深牢」一开口「求告」（57节），就会发现神立刻「临近」（57节）、好像从来没有离开（赛五十八9；六十五24）。那位「施行杀戮，并不顾惜」（43节）的神，忽然发出了鼓励和安慰；祂就像从前一样对自己的百姓说：「不要惧怕」（57节；创十五1；二十六24；书八1），因为拯救已经临到（58节）！\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 人只有彻底认清了自己的罪，才能求神「按着他们手所做的向他们施行报应」（64节）；否则，「你论断行这样事的人，自己所行的却和别人一样，你以为能逃脱神的审判吗」（罗二3）？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 诗人在求神拯救的祷告（52-57节）得蒙垂听之后（58节），竟然得寸进尺、求神报应仇敌（58-66节）。人若得蒙赦免，岂不应该心中充满饶恕吗（太十八21-35）？人若蒙神恩典，岂不应该更爱自己的仇敌吗（太五38-48）？但这些只是个人恩怨的原则，并不适合于神的仇敌。虽然犹大被神管教是咎由自取，但那些被神用来审判犹大的器皿也是神的仇敌。他们设计谋害（60-62节）、嘲弄（63节）神的百姓，动机并非出于公义，「都是主看不上的」（36节）。所以神早已预言，祂在管教之后必「要伸祂仆人流血的冤，报应祂的敌人，洁净祂的地，救赎祂的百姓」（申三十二43），包括亚述（赛十12）、巴比伦（耶五十-五十一章）和周围的列邦（耶四十六-四十九章）。因为神管教自己的百姓，不是要让人对神退避三舍，而是要让世人都认识祂、敬畏祂，因此「当以嘴亲子，恐怕祂发怒，你们便在道中灭亡，因为祂的怒气快要发作。凡投靠祂的，都是有福的」（诗二12）。\n今天，面对抵挡神的世人，信徒不可滥用廉价的爱心、应许虚假的平安，以致他们心安理得地在无知之中走向灭亡，因为神说：「这恶人必死在罪孽之中；我却要向你讨他丧命的罪」（结三18）。相反，每一个主的门徒都「当以基督耶稣的心为心」（腓二5），求神「发怒追赶他们，从耶和华的天下除灭他们」（66节），好「叫一切在天上的、地上的，和地底下的，因耶稣的名无不屈膝，无不口称『耶稣基督为主』，使荣耀归与父神」（腓二10-11）。而除灭神仇敌的最好方法，就是「劝人与祂和好」（林后五18）。「因为我们作仇敌的时候，且借着神儿子的死，得与神和好」（罗五10），所以我们也当作基督的使者、替基督求世人与神和好（林后五20 ）！\n耶利米哀歌第3章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":53,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/029_Joel/Joel_03/","title":"珥三章","section":"Joel","content":"3:1 到那日、我使犹大和耶路撒冷被掳之人归回的时候、1\n3:2 我要聚集万民、带他们下到约沙法谷。在那里施行审判、因为他们将我的百姓、就是我的产业以色列、分散在列国中。又分取我的地土。\n3:3 且为我的百姓拈阄、将童子换妓女、卖童女买酒喝。\n3:4 推罗西顿、和非利士四境的人哪、你们与我何干。你们要报复我么。若报复我、我必使报应速速归到你们的头上。\n3:5 你们既然夺取我的金银、又将我可爱的宝物带入你们宫殿、〔或作庙中〕\n3:6 并将犹大人、和耶路撒冷人、卖给希腊人〔原文是雅完人〕使他们远离自己的境界。\n3:7 我必激动他们离开你们所卖到之地、又必使报应归到你们的头上。\n3:8 我必将你们的儿女卖在犹大人的手中、他们必卖给远方示巴国的人。这是耶和华说的。\n3:9 当在万民中宣告说、要预备打仗。激动勇士。使一切战士上前来。\n3:10 要将犁头打成刀剑、将镰刀打成戈矛。软弱的要说、我有勇力。\n3:11 四围的列国阿、你们要速速地来、一同聚集。耶和华阿、求你使你的大能者降临。\n3:12 万民都当兴起、上到约沙法谷。因为我必坐在那里、审判四围的列国。\n3:13 开镰吧。因为庄稼熟了。践踏吧。因为酒醡满了、酒池盈溢。他们的罪恶甚大。\n3:14 许多许多的人在断定谷。因为耶和华的日子临近断定谷。\n3:15 日月昏暗、星宿无光。\n3:16 耶和华必从锡安吼叫、从耶路撒冷发声。天地就震动。耶和华却要作他百姓的避难所、作以色列人的保障。\n3:17 你们就知道我是耶和华你们的　神、且又住在锡安我的圣山。那时、耶路撒冷必成为圣、外邦人不再从其中经过。\n3:18 到那日、大山要滴甜酒、小山要流奶子、犹大溪河、都有水流。必有泉源从耶和华的殿中流出来、滋润什亭谷。\n3:19 埃及必然荒凉、以东变为凄凉的旷野、都因向犹大人所行的强暴、又因在本地流无辜人的血。\n3:20 但犹大必存到永远。耶路撒冷必存到万代。\n3:21 我未曾报复〔或作洗除下同〕流血的罪、现在我要报复、因为耶和华住在锡安。\n  神的救赎计划，不但要使祂所拣选的百姓得着恢复，也要使抵挡祂的仇敌受到审判。因此，神在启示了救恩的真理之后（二18-32），马上就启示了审判的计划（1-21节）。今天，我们若只敢传讲神的拯救，却不敢传讲神的审判，就是在传讲「别的福音」（加一6）。\n约珥书第3章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":54,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/104_John/John_03/","title":"John 03","section":"Book of John","content":"Book of John\n3:1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:\n3:2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.\n3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\n3:4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?

百姓在圣殿重建完成之后，已经等了83年，还没有等到神「回到锡安」（亚八3），所以失望地质疑：「公义的神在哪里呢」（二17）？但「想望耶和华日子来到的有祸了」（摩五18），因为他们表面「所寻求、所仰慕」的，实际上并不是他们心里想要的；正如他们按部就班的献祭，实际上也不是神所要的爱的回应（一2）、不是「凭公义献供物给耶和华」（3节）。为了显明人的愚昧，神宣告：「你们所寻求的主必忽然进入祂的殿」（1节），使「耶和华的荣光充满了殿」（结四十三5）；祂将彻底洁净百姓（3节），使「犹大和耶路撒冷所献的供物必蒙耶和华悦纳」（4节）。但弥赛亚的「审判」（5节）却不是「叶公好龙」的百姓所等候的。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 今天，主耶稣也是许多信徒「所寻求、所仰慕」（1节）的。但实际上，他们「所寻求的」只是一个能满足自己的主，「所仰慕的」只是一个能安慰自己的神，一切都是为了爱自己。但主耶稣「临近」（5节）我们，却是要用火「熬炼」我们，让我们能用爱来回应神、「凭公义献供物给耶和华」。如果我们把祂当作一个叫作「主耶稣」的偶像，「祂来的日子，谁能当得起呢？祂显现的时候，谁能立得住呢」（2节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「我必临近你们」（5节），正是神对「公义的神在哪里呢」（二17）的回答。百姓以为弥赛亚的拯救是为了对付他们的仇敌，不料弥赛亚却要从他们开始「施行审判」（5节），用审判来恢复神的百姓。\n本节列出的罪，包括得罪神和得罪人两大类。而得罪人的原因，是因为不敬畏神。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神在87年前，已经借着先知撒迦利亚呼吁「你们要转向我，我就转向你们」（亚一3）。现在，神再次呼召百姓回转（7节）。但口口声声「公义」（二17）的百姓却一脸无辜地问：「我们如何才是转向呢」（7节）？他们觉得自己追求公义良善、献祭也按部就班，并没有「常常偏离」（7节）。当人觉得自己没有问题的时候，可能已经愚昧到不认识自己的地步了。但神却以「丰富的恩慈、宽容、忍耐」（罗二4）来领他们悔改，继续光照这些自以为没有「偏离」的百姓，耐心地指出他们的问题（8-11节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「当献的供物」（8节），包括百姓所献的祭牲中归给祭司的分（出二十九27-28；利七32；民五9 ），每年带到耶路撒冷与仆婢、利未人分享的第二个十分之一（申十四22-23），以及每逢第三年与本城的利未人、寄居的和孤儿寡妇分享的第三个十分之一（申十四28-29）。因此，以色列人平均每年大约要奉献25%。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「试试」（10节）原文与「试探」（15节；诗九十五9）是同一个词。神禁止人「试探神」（申六16；诗九十五9），在此却鼓励百姓「试试」祂，实际上是一种讽刺。百姓一面在当尽的本分上「行诡诈」（一14），一面义愤填膺地质问「公义的神在哪里呢」（二17）。因此，神用讽刺的口气建议他们不要停留在嘴上，不妨付点代价「试试」神，看看神是不是真实的。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 这些「顶撞」（13节）神的不是普通人，而是自以为敬虔事奉（14节）、比别人更加谦卑良善（15节）的人。他们可能是对祭司失望的百姓，也可能是缺乏供应的利未人，他们在等候中失去了耐心，开始抱怨神、「顶撞」神。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 在等候神的过程中，有的人失去了耐心，质疑「公义的神在哪里呢」（二17）；而有的人凭信心等候。「敬畏耶和华的彼此谈论」（16节），神必「侧耳而听」（16节），并且记在「纪念册」（16节）上。今天，「凡人所说的闲话，当审判的日子，必要句句供出来；因为要凭你的话定你为义，也要凭你的话定你有罪」（路六36-37）。许多信徒自以为虔诚，却不能勒住自己的舌头，实际上是自欺欺人；圣灵说：「这人的虔诚是虚的」（雅一26），「因为心里所充满的，口里就说出来」（路六45）。

和合本)\n魂的得救是得胜。\n林前三章描述了一些属肉体的基督徒。没有赏赐，将来不能进入千年国度，反在黑暗中切齿哀哭。\n跌倒是当时的亏损，还能起来；堕落就很难回到起初的地位了。\nBrother L: 你的意思是说，这些属肉体的基督徒虽然仅仅得救，但不能进千年国度？ Brother D: 是。\n王进来观看宾客，见那里有一个没有穿礼服的，就对他说：‘朋友，你到这里来怎么不穿礼服呢？’那人无言可答。于是王对使唤的人说：‘捆起他的手脚来，把他丢在外边的黑暗里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。’(马太福音 22:11-13 和合本)\n衣服代表行为。有光明洁白的细麻衣，有参加婚宴的礼服。有义的行为，与所蒙恩相配，就是约束自己思想感情意志的，魂顺服灵生命的，舍己的，背十字架的得胜者。\n神国是指神掌权的地方，启示录第11章15节，世界上的万国要成为我主和主基督的国。就是神的国降在人间了。\n那时是神国的实现( Realization)，如今神在我们里面掌权，我们就在神的国里是指神国的实际( Reality)\n千年国度有时间限制，只有一千年，是一个赏赐，千年国度之后，新天新地是永远。\nBrother L: 那么，传福音的时候，若是单单讲悔改，得救就可以进天堂，就是不够的。甚至还是错的？\n“天堂”这个概念是不是太不明确？\nBrother D: 是。\nBrother L: 仅仅得救的基督徒会在“黑暗里”，这样的结局震撼到我！\n我一直以为，得救了（哪怕仅仅得救），就等于有了一张将来进天堂的门票，可以与耶稣在一起。\nBrother D: 一千年也长，也不长。盼望我们都成为魂得救的。\nBrother L: 你的意思是说：在将来的千年国度时期，得胜的基督徒在国度里，不得胜的基督徒在黑暗里。千年以后的新天新地时期，得胜的基督徒和不得胜的基督徒都与耶稣在一起？\nBrother D: 是。\nBut I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

第1节\n保罗在此并非是教导一些该做什么、不该做什么的基督教伦理，用基督教的律法来代替犹太教的律法。神不需要我们靠自己努力遵行基督教伦理来「行事为人」，而是先赐给我们「恩」，供应我们「心里的力量」（三16）来「行事为人」，我们只需要「顺着圣灵而行」（加五16），把所得着的「恩」实际地活出来。神并不把重担加给我们，不需要我们活出自己所没有的，只要把已经从神手中接过来的活出来就行了；祂不需要我们多活，只要「与蒙召的恩相称」就够了，若不「相称」就亏欠了神。\u0026#8617;\n[2]: 第2节\n「谦虚、温柔、忍耐、爱心、和平」（2节）是「与蒙召的恩相称」（1节）的生活的五个特质，这些都不是天然人所具备的品德，而是 神的性情，是圣灵所结的果子（加五22-23）。 \u0026#8617;\n[3]: 第8节\n「恩赐」（8节）表面上看是人所具备的一种特长，但又不同于世人的特长。恩赐是圣灵的供应（林前十二4-11），不是人学习、模仿、训练、努力的结果。一切学来的东西都不是恩赐，工作方法是可以从训练中学到，但恩赐不能从训练中产生出来。 神赐下恩赐的目的是为了「建立基督的身体」（12节），在建造基督的身体上不可或缺的特长才是恩赐，可有可无的就不算恩赐。神不能使用不是恩赐的特长去建造祂的教会，只有神借着圣灵赐下来的、目的为建立基督的身体的特长，才是能被神所使用的恩赐，才能让神在教会中得着荣耀（三21）。这恩赐只有在实际的事奉中才能显明出来，并在不住的运用中成为老练。 \u0026#8617;\n[4]: 第12节\n我们应当好好思想，今天各种关于教会管理、增长的方法和制度，是神赐下的恩赐，还是人发明的东西呢？神赐下恩赐，让肢体用恩赐彼此配搭、同心事奉，目的是「建立基督的身体」（12节），而不是为了表现某个人的能力、属灵。 \u0026#8617;\n[5]: 第16节\n每个肢体的目标不是个人得造就，而是基督身体的长进、教会整体的建立。\u0026#8617;\n[6]: 第20节\n「却不是这样」（20节），指属乎基督的人领受了基督的新生命，不再「与神所赐的生命隔绝了」（18节），因此就不会再故意「无知，心里刚硬」（18节），人生不再「虚妄」（17节）、心地不再「昏昧」（18节），也不再能继续「放纵私欲，贪行种种的污秽」（19节），因为圣灵会代替我们的良心责备我们、引导我们、管理我们。\u0026#8617;\n[7]: 第22节\n「旧人」（22节）指「旧的本质」，包括我们天然的心思言行、生活方式。神不是让我们去改善「旧人」，除掉缺点、留下优点，而是像脱旧衣服那样完全「脱去」（22节），把「旧人」里的好、坏、缺点、优点完全丢弃。因为这「旧人」不但已经变坏，而且会像烂苹果继续传染，使人继续变坏。 我们无法靠自己的努力「脱去」旧人，只有进入基督里，让圣灵使我们「脱去旧人、心志改换一新、穿上新人」（23-24节）。在基督里我们已经是新造的人，基督的生命、性情、心思在我们里面，我们稍微要转离神的道路，里面的圣灵就会立刻责备我们，这样我们才可能脱去「从前行为上的旧人」（22节）。 \u0026#8617;\n[8]: 第23节\n人的败坏是「虚妄的心」（17节）与神隔绝（18节）的结果，所以神的恢复也从「心志」（23节）着手，借着圣灵把我们的心志「改换一新」（23节），用新生命去对付旧生命，才能完全「脱去从前行为上的旧人」（22节）。 「改换一新」原文是被动式，不是我们自己能靠自己更新心志，乃是我们的心志被圣灵更新。原文又是现在式，指不断地更新，人靠自己只能更新一时、一事，只有在基督里才能保持不断的更新。\r我们的心志被圣灵「改换一新」的结果，是「穿上新人」（24节），用「新人」（24节）来完全代替「旧人」，不保留「旧人」里的任何事物，无论是人看为坏的、还是看为好的。 \u0026#8617;\n[9]: 第24节\n「神的形象」最重要的是「真理的仁义和圣洁」（24节）。「仁义」是「新人」在人前的本分，就是凡事合乎神的法则；「圣洁」是「新人」在神前的本分，就是凡事合乎神的性情。而这两者都是根据基督里的「真理」，而不是人的标准。在基督里新造的人，必然能让人看见身上有「真理的仁义和圣洁」的流露，看见「神的形象」。\u0026#8617;\n[10]: 第26节\n「生气却不要犯罪」（26节）引自七十士译本的诗四4。「生气」是神所造的七情六欲，本身并不是犯罪，主耶稣也曾「生气」（可三5；约二13-17），但祂的「生气」是为神发「义怒」，并未得罪神。「旧人」的特点是「放纵私欲」（19节），包括毫无节制地放纵自己的怒气，害人害己，成为得罪神的「犯罪」。而「新人」是照着神的心意表达自己的情绪，在圣灵的管理下控制自己的情绪，而不是让肉体支配、放纵自己的情绪。 \u0026#8617;\n[11]: 第30节\n圣灵的印记，在信主的时候发生了。约十四16-18那里说圣灵是一份礼物。\u0026#8617;\n[12]: 第32节\n从「旧人」里面出来的饶恕，只是出于人的修养，过后还是耿耿于怀；而从「新人」里面出来的饶恕，就像神那样无条件而彻底，「东离西有多远，祂叫我们的过犯离我们也有多远」（诗一百零三12）。

该隐先献，但是他并不认真，他随便拿地里的一些出产来献。\nProverbs3章9-10节，所罗门说，“你要以财物和一切初熟的土产尊荣耶和华。这样，你的仓房必充满有余；你的酒醡有新酒盈溢。”\n请留意，该隐只是拿“地里的出产为供物献给耶和华”，没有说“初熟的”。可见他并不是抱着尊荣神的心在献。该隐可能心想，“为什么要有个上帝，我还得向祂献祭，真麻烦！”就随意凑和，拿点地里的出产为供物来献。按照犹太拉比的说法，该隐献的是一些烂掉的果子。该隐行得不好，他那藐视神的态度，在神面前就不蒙悦纳。\n曾经有一个喻道故事，是这么说的，有一个人作了一个梦，梦见撒但和邪灵污鬼开会：商量用什么办法，可以破坏基督的工作？有一个污鬼说，“有一次有许多人要前往非洲要传福音；他们过大西洋时，我就刮了一阵大风，把船吹翻，人都淹死了。”撒但说这个办法好是好，但是你要知道他们还是有人会继续前去。又有一个污鬼说，“有一次有人前往阿拉伯传福音，我就叫强盗在半路抢劫他，并且杀了他。”撒但说这还是不行，还是会有人不顾性命继续到阿拉伯去传道。\n末了有一个污鬼说，“我曾用了十几年工夫，叫一个信徒马马虎虎的过日子，作不冷不热的会友。”撒但一听这个法子，眼睛就亮了，说，“好极了！”于是下令所有的污鬼，都照这个诡计去行。\n该隐不管“神”要做什么，他只想“自己”想做的。他看献祭为麻烦，心存藐视。所献的就是“虚浮的供物”。他的心态就是“何必要理会神呢？我就是神！”\n可以推想，该隐的献祭只是“做做样子”。今天我们也要提醒自己，不要走了该隐的路。\n亚伯是第二个出生到世界的人，但却是第一个顺服神，走在合神心意道路中的人。\n孙大中推想，亚伯根据创世记3章15节，“我又要叫你和女人彼此为仇；你的后裔和女人的后裔，也彼此为仇。女人的后裔要伤你的头，你要伤他的脚跟。”以及创世记3章21节，“耶和华的为亚当和他妻子用皮子作衣服，给他们穿。”从神所说的和所做的当中，亚伯领悟到了福音真理。神说“我要……。”他就仰望神，把指望放在神的身上。\n在献祭的事上亚伯非常认真，他照着神所当受的敬畏，从羊群中“精挑细选”，把“精品”献上。按着神的圣洁、公义献上流血的祭。这是圣经最早记载的“血祭”。\n亚伯所献的不能除去他的罪。真正除去他的罪，洁净他的，是以后基督所流的宝血。但亚伯的“动机”和“心意”，是神所悦纳的。圣经说，“神看中了亚伯和他的供物。”\n亚伯的献祭是出于圣灵感动，是“因信”献上的。他清楚知道神要的是什么，他用虔诚敬畏的心，照着所明白的去做，把“最好的”献上。从他所献的“礼物”，见证了他对神的心意。\n亚伯敬畏神，把信心放在神“所说”的和神“所要做”的事情上，便得了称义的见证。\n有很多圣经学者推想，神可能指示过该隐、亚伯该怎么献祭，亚伯顺服照着去做，所以蒙神悦纳，但圣经没有这么说。\n孙大中的看法是，亚伯从神所说的和所做的，看见了“福音”的亮光。照着所明白的去献，神悦纳亚伯和他所献的祭。因为有“指着他的礼物所作的见证”，就成为后人所仿效，并成了神所定规的“献祭模式”──把羊群中头生的和羊的脂油献上。\n头生牛、羊的脂油和血，这些代表亚伯献祭的心。以后，神在利未记17章11节启示，“活物的生命是在血中。我把这血赐给你们，可以在坛上为你们的生命赎罪；因血里有生命，所以能赎罪。” 神的指示来到之前，亚伯已经照着这样的期望去献了。神接受了牛羊的血，作为基督宝血的“预表”。\n希伯来书9章22节，作者说，“按着律法，凡物差不多都是用血洁净的，若不流血，罪就不得赦免了。”\n亚伯的献祭，就成了神的羔羊作为“未来祭物”的一种最原始，最早的“图解”。这样的献祭，一直到基督在十字架上说，“成了”，就停止了。希伯来书7章27节，作者说，“他只一次将自己献上，就把这事成全了。”\n神接纳亚伯“代替性牺牲”的做法，设立祂的爱子基督作为挽回祭，保罗说，“是凭着耶稣的血，借着人的信，要显明神的义。”\n亚伯因着信献祭与神，就比该隐所献的更美。耶稣称亚伯是“义人亚伯”。\n2022年3月8日：亚伯的献祭\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

4:1 黄金何其失光。纯金何其变色。圣所的石头倒在各市口上。1\n4:2 锡安宝贵的众子、好比精金、现在何竟算为窑匠手所作的瓦瓶。\n4:3 野狗尚且把奶乳哺其子、我民的妇人倒成为残忍、好像旷野的鸵鸟一般。2\n4:4 吃奶孩子的舌头、因干渴贴住上膛。孩童求饼、无人擘给他们。\n4:5 素来吃美好食物的、现今在街上变为孤寒。素来卧朱红褥子的、现今躺卧粪堆。\n4:6 都因我众民的罪孽、比所多玛的罪还大。所多玛虽然无人加手于他、还是转眼之间被倾覆。3\n4:7 锡安的贵胄、素来比雪纯净、比奶更白。他们的身体、比红宝玉〔或作珊瑚〕更红、像光润的蓝宝石一样。\n4:8 现在他们的面貌比煤炭更黑、以致在街上无人认识。他们的皮肤、紧贴骨头、枯干如同槁木。\n4:9 饿死的、不如被刀杀的、因为这是缺了田间的土产、就身体衰弱、渐渐消灭。\n4:10 慈悲的妇人、当我众民被毁灭的时候、亲手煮自己的儿女作为食物。\n4:11 耶和华发怒成就他所定的、倒出他的烈怒。在锡安使火着起、烧毁锡安的根基。3\n4:12 地上的君王、和世上的居民、都不信敌人和仇敌能进耶路撒冷的城门。\n4:13 这都因他先知的罪恶、和祭司的罪孽。他们在城中流了义人的血。\n4:14 他们在街上如瞎子乱走、又被血玷污、以致人不能摸他们的衣服。\n4:15 人向他们喊着说、不洁净的。躲开、躲开、不要挨近我。他们逃走飘流的时候、列国中有人说、他们不可仍在这里寄居。\n4:16 耶和华发怒、将他们分散、不再眷顾他们。人不重看祭司、也不厚待长老。\n4:17 我们仰望人来帮助、以致眼目失明、还是枉然。我们所盼望的、竟盼望一个不能救人的国。\n4:18 仇敌追赶我们的脚步像打猎的、以致我们不敢在自己的街上行走。我们的结局临近、我们的日子满足、我们的结局来到了。\n4:19 追赶我们的、比空中的鹰更快。他们在山上追逼我们、在旷野埋伏、等候我们。\n4:20 耶和华的受膏者、好比我们鼻中的气、在他们的坑中被捉住。我们曾论到他说、我们必在他荫下、在列国中存活。4\n4:21 住乌斯地的以东民哪、只管欢喜快乐。苦杯也必传到你那里。你必喝醉、以致露体。\n4:22 锡安的民哪、你罪孽的刑罚受足了。耶和华必不使你再被掳去。以东的民哪、他必追讨你的罪孽、显露你的罪恶。5\n   「圣所的石头」（1节），原文是「圣洁的石头」（英文ESV译本）。以色列被神拣选「作祭司的国度，为圣洁的国民」（出十九6），本是神眼中的「黄金、纯金、圣洁的石头」（1节），但现在却失去了光泽、被弃置于街头，圣殿被劫掠、百姓被屠杀（王下二十五9；耶十二12-23）。那些自认是「精金」（2节）的人，如今却在仇敌眼中降卑为「瓦瓶」（2节），那些素来「吃美好食物、卧朱红褥子」（5节）的权贵，现在却「在街上变为孤寒、躺卧粪堆」（5节）。神的百姓在世界所追求的一切虚假，最终都会被世界夺走，因为这是他们当得的。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「好像旷野的鸵鸟一般」（3节），这是一句谚语，比喻母亲不顾孩子。因为古人观察到鸵鸟「把蛋留在地上，在尘土中使得温暖；却想不到被脚踹碎，或被野兽践踏」（伯三十九14-15），好像对雏鸟不管不顾。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 1-11节抚今思昔，回顾锡安被神拆毁时不堪回首的光景，承认这一切都是因为「众民的罪孽比所多玛的罪还大」（6节）。整体是一个交错平行的结构：\nA. 锡安的众子被降卑（1-2节）；\nB. 孩童与成人遭受饥荒（3-5节）；\nC. 承认百姓是因罪受罚（6节）\nA1. 锡安的贵胄被降卑（7-8节）；\nB1. 孩童与成人遭受饥荒（9-10节）；\nC1. 承认锡安是被神惩罚（11节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 12-20节列出神拆毁锡安的四个原因，根源都是因为百姓「仰望人来帮助」（17节），却不肯「诚实倚靠耶和华」（赛十20）：\n倚靠耶路撒冷（12节）；\n倚靠假先知和祭司（13-16节）；\n倚靠埃及（17节）；\n倚靠君王（18-20节）。\n「耶和华的受膏者」（20节）指西底家王，君王也成了百姓所倚靠的「鼻中的气」（20节），以为「必在他荫下，在列国中存活」（20节），结果他却自身难保。并非所有的大卫的后裔都能成为人的倚靠（耶三十三26），惟有那位大卫的后裔弥赛亚基督（提后二8）。\n无论在哪个世代，神的百姓若是「仰望人来帮助」（17节），无论仰赖的是圣城（12节）、祭司、先知（13节），还是埃及（17节）、君王（20节），无论倚靠的教会、牧者，还是外援、亲友，只要是定睛在人的身上，即使迫切到「以致眼目失明」（17节），终究「还是枉然」（17节）。因为我们倚靠什么，神就会拆毁什么；一定要把我们拆毁到一个地步，让我们能体会：「除祢以外，在天上我有谁呢？除祢以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的」（诗七十三25）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 21-22节预言了两种人的结局：一种是有所倚靠的「以东的民」（22节）、一种是无依无靠的「锡安的民」（22节）；一种是肉体的生命，一种是属灵的生命。\n一个属神的人，肉体的生命虽然会像锡安一样被神拆毁，但属灵的生命却是从圣灵而生，经历过风雨、必能见彩虹（创九14）。因此，「你罪孽的刑罚受足了，耶和华必不使你再被掳去」（22节）。这是不再仰望人（17节）的「锡安的民」所得的应许，也是「靠圣灵得生」（加五25）的人所蒙的安慰。当我们在地上所倚靠的一切都被拆毁以后（12-20节），神的恢复也就不远了（22节）。

耶和华的日子，并不是普救万民的日子。对于敬畏神、忠心等候神的人（2节），神的审判就像「公义的日头」（2节），给他们带来「医治」（赛五十七18-19）和「释放」（赛六十一1）；不自己伸冤的人，将来却必「践踏恶人」（3节）。而对于「凡狂傲的和行恶的」、包括那些自以为义地质问「公义的神在哪里呢」（二17）的人，神的审判却像「烧着的火炉」（1节），使他们「在那日必被烧尽，根本枝条一无存留」（1节）。今天，多少人「叶公好龙」地呼吁公义，却从来不想想，当公义之神真正临到的时候，自己会不会被「烧着的火炉」烧尽呢？「祂来的日子，谁能当得起呢？祂显现的时候，谁能立得住呢」（三2）？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 4-6节是本书的结语，也是《十二先知书》的结语。为了回避《十二先知书》以「咒诅」结束的尖锐事实，犹太人在读完第6节之后，要再读一次第5节。实际上，「咒诅」这个词完美地总结了旧约，因为整本旧约都在告诉我们：人已经「全然败坏」（申三十一29），无法倚靠肉体「遵守全律法」（雅二10）；因此，「凡以行律法为本的，都是被咒诅的」（加三10）。但神却为我们预备了更美的救恩：「律法既因肉体软弱，有所不能行的，神就差遣自己的儿子，成为罪身的形状，作了赎罪祭」（罗八3）。4-6节完美地总结了「律法和先知」（太七12）：「摩西」（4节）代表律法，「以利亚」（5节）代表先知，律法和先知都是为基督作见证（路二十四27）。主耶稣基督不是要「废掉律法和先知」（太五17），「乃是要成全」（太五17），所以祂在变像山与摩西和以利亚一起谈论「祂在耶路撒冷将要成的事」（路九31）。 圣灵使用本书，预备旧约百姓开始四百多年耐心的等候，让他们一面记念遵行「摩西的律法」（4节），一面警醒等候「先知以利亚」（4节）为基督开路。圣灵也使用本书，预备新约百姓盼望基督的到来，让他们承认自己是只配「咒诅」的罪人，接受「基督既为我们受了咒诅，就赎出我们脱离律法的咒诅」（加三13）。而在新天新地里，「以后再没有咒诅」（启二十二3；亚十四11），整本圣经将以「主耶稣的恩惠常与众圣徒同在」（启二十二21）结束！\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man\u0026rsquo;s blood upon us.\n5:29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.\n5:30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.\n5:31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.\n5:32 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.\n5:33 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.\n5:34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;\n5:35 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.\n5:36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.\n5:37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.\n5:38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:\n5:39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\n5:40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.\n5:41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.\n5:42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\n\r5:1 有一个人、名叫亚拿尼亚、同他的妻子撒非喇、卖了田产。\n5:2 把价银私自留下几分、他的妻子也知道、其余的几分、拿来放在使徒脚前。\n5:3 彼得说、亚拿尼亚为甚么撒但充满了你的心、叫你欺哄圣灵、把田地的价银私自留下几分呢。\n5:4 田地还没有卖、不是你自己的么。既卖了、价银不是你作主么。你怎么心里起这意念呢。你不是欺哄人、是欺哄　神了。\n5:5 亚拿尼亚听见这话、就仆倒断了气。听见的人都甚惧怕。\n5:6 有些少年人起来、把他包裹抬出去埋葬了。\n5:7 约过了三小时、他的妻子进来、还不知道这事。\n5:8 彼得对他说、你告诉我、你们卖田地的价银、就是这些么。他说、就是这些。\n5:9 彼得说、你们为甚么同心试探主的灵呢。埋葬你丈夫之人的脚、已到门口、他们也要把你抬出去。\n5:10 妇人立刻仆倒在彼得脚前、断了气。那些少年人进来、见他已经死了、就抬出去、埋在他丈夫旁边。\n5:11 全教会、和听见这事的人、都甚惧怕。\n5:12 主借使徒的手、在民间行了许多神迹奇事、（他们〔或作信的人〕都同心合意的在所罗门的廊下。\n5:13 其余的人、没有一个敢贴近他们。百姓却尊重他们。\n5:14 信而归主的人、越发增添、连男带女很多) 5:15 甚至有人将病人抬到街上、放在床上、或褥子上、指望彼得过来的时候、或者得他的影儿照在甚么人身上。\n5:16 还有许多人、带着病人、和被污鬼缠磨的、从耶路撒冷四围的城邑来、全都得了医治。\n5:17 大祭司和他的一切同人、就是撒都该教门的人、都起来、满心忌恨。\n5:18 就下手拿住使徒、收在外监。\n5:19 但主的使者、夜间开了监门、领他们出来、\n5:20 说、你们去站在殿里、把这生命的道、都讲给百姓听。\n5:21 使徒听了这话、天将亮的时候、就进殿里去教训人。大祭司和他的同人来了、叫齐公会的人、和以色列族的众长老、就差人到监里去、要把使徒提出来。\n5:22 但差役到了、不见他们在监里、就回来禀报说、\n5:23 我们看见监牢关得极妥当、看守的人也站在门外、及至开了门、里面一个人都不见。\n5:24 守殿官和祭司长听见这话、心里犯难、不知这事将来如何。\n5:25 有一个人来禀报说、你们收在监里的人、现在站在殿里教训百姓。\n5:26 于是守殿官和差役去带使徒来、并没有用强暴。因为怕百姓用石头打他们。\n5:27 带到了、便叫使徒站在公会前、大祭司问他们说、\n5:28 我们不是严严的禁止你们、不可奉这名教训人么。你们倒把你们的道理充满了耶路撒冷、想要叫这人的血归到我们身上。\n5:29 彼得和众使徒回答说、顺从　神、不顺从人、是应当的。\n5:30 你们挂在木头上杀害的耶稣、我们祖宗的　神已经叫他复活。\n5:31 神且用右手将他高举、〔或作他就是　神高举在自己的右边〕叫他作君王、作救主、将悔改的心、和赦罪的恩、赐给以色列人。\n5:32 我们为这事作见证。　神赐给顺从之人的圣灵、也为这事作见证。\n5:33 公会的人听见就极其恼怒、想要杀他们。\n5:34 但有一个法利赛人、名叫迦玛列、是众百姓所敬重的教法师、在公会中站起来、吩咐人把使徒暂且带到外面去。\n5:35 就对众人说、以色列人哪、论到这些人、你们应当小心怎样办理。\n5:36 从前丢大起来、自夸为大。附从他的人约有四百。他被杀后、附从他的全都散了、归于无有。\n5:37 此后报名上册的时候、又有加利利的犹大起来、引诱些百姓跟从他、他也灭亡、附从他的人也都四散了。\n5:38 现在我劝你们不要管这些人、任凭他们吧。他们所谋的、所行的、若是出于人、必要败坏。\n5:39 若是出于　神、你们就不能败坏他们。恐怕你们倒是攻击　神了。\n5:40 公会的人听从了他、便叫使徒来、把他们打了、又吩咐他们不可奉耶稣的名讲道、就把他们释放了。\n5:41 他们离开公会、心里欢喜。因被算是配为这名受辱。\n5:42 他们就每日在殿里、在家里、不住的教训人、传耶稣是基督。\n"},{"id":74,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/121_1_Peter/1Pt_05/","title":"1 Peter 5","section":"1 Peter","content":"KJV\r和合本\r\r5:1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:\n5:2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;\n5:3 Neither as being lords over God\u0026rsquo;s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.\n5:4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.\n5:5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder.

5:1 耶和华阿、求你记念我们所遭遇的事。观看我们所受的凌辱。 (1)\n5:2 我们的产业、归与外邦人。我们的房屋、归与外路人。\n5:3 我们是无父的孤儿。我们的母亲、好像寡妇。\n5:4 我们出钱才得水喝。我们的柴是人卖给我们的。\n5:5 追赶我们的、到了我们的颈项上。我们疲乏不得歇息。\n5:6 我们投降埃及人、和亚述人、为要得粮吃饱。\n5:7 我们列祖犯罪、而今不在了。我们担当他们的罪孽。 (2)\n5:8 奴仆辖制我们。无人救我们脱离他们的手。\n5:9 因为旷野的刀剑、我们冒着险、才得粮食。\n5:10 因饥饿燥热、我们的皮肤就黑如炉。\n5:11 敌人在锡安玷污妇人、在犹大的城邑玷污处女。\n5:12 他们吊起首领的手、也不尊敬老人的面。\n5:13 少年人扛磨石、孩童背木柴、都绊跌了。\n5:14 老年人在城门口断绝、少年人不再作乐。\n5:15 我们心中的快乐止息、跳舞变为悲哀。\n5:16 冠冕从我们的头上落下。我们犯罪了、我们有祸了。\n5:17 这些事我们心里发昏。我们的眼睛昏花。\n5:18 锡安山荒凉、野狗〔或作狐狸〕行在其上。\n5:19 耶和华阿、你存到永远、你的宝座、存到万代。\n5:20 你为何永远忘记我们、为何许久离弃我们。 (3)\n5:21 耶和华阿、求你使我们向你回转、我们便得回转。求你复新我们的日子、像古时一样。 (4)\n5:22 你竟全然弃绝我们、向我们大发烈怒。5\n   百姓的遭遇虽然悲惨（1-18节），但在地上却无人记念；因为这个世界没有最惨、只有更惨，再痛的苦楚也会被人忘却、无人关注，成为历史中的一粒尘埃，而历史的尘沙落在每个人身上都是一座大山。但人无论如何渺小、卑微、失败，「造他的主」（箴十四31；十七5）却始终关心他们，所以百姓可以求神「记念我们所遭遇的事，观看我们所受的凌辱」（1节）。神的「记念」不只是「观看」，更会伴随着拯救。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「我们列祖犯罪，而今不在了；我们担当他们的罪孽」（7节），指父母若是犯罪，必然会影响儿女（出二十5；申五9）；今天错误的决定，将来必然有苦果。冰冻三尺非一日之寒，今天的现实都是过去的结果。但选民的历史证明，亚当的后裔都是学坏容易学好难，人很难学习敬虔的父母（王上十一4），却很容易效法败坏的祖先（王下二十三32、37；二十四9、14）。因此，百姓并非只是代替祖先受罚（但九16），而是因为效法先祖犯罪（耶十一10；王下十七14），「各人必因自己的罪死亡；凡吃酸葡萄的，自己的牙必酸倒」（耶三十一30）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 若不是神主动施恩，人没有可能自己主动回转，所以诗人说：「神啊，求祢使我们回转，使祢的脸发光，我们便要得救」（诗八十3、7、19；八十五4）。\n「祢为何永远忘记我们？为何许久离弃我们」（20节），这是表达痛苦之中的感受（诗二十二1），也是呼求神在应验圣约中的背约咒诅之后（利二十六14-39；申二十八15-65），继续成就圣约中的复兴应许（利二十六40-45；申三十1-10）。先知耶利米当然不会认为神会永远离弃百姓（耶三十一36-37），因为他熟悉圣约的应许：「虽是这样，他们在仇敌之地，我却不厌弃他们，也不厌恶他们，将他们尽行灭绝，也不背弃我与他们所立的约，因为我是耶和华——他们的神」（利二十六44）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 百姓受苦，并非因为自己的神不如巴比伦的偶像，而是因为离弃了真神，所以被神管教（一12-15；二1-8；四11）。\n但是，若不是神主动施恩，人没有可能自己主动回转，所以诗人说：「神啊，求祢使我们回转，使祢的脸发光，我们便要得救」（诗八十3、7、19；八十五4）。同样，先知所求的最大的怜悯，是「求祢使我们向祢回转，我们便得回转」（21节）。而神使刚硬者回转、向顽梗者施怜悯的方式，就是「大发烈怒」（22节）；天性悖逆的人只有经历过神管教的「烈怒」，才能知道神是应当敬畏的，才肯回转归向祂，好使祂能「复新我们」（21节）。如果人拒绝管教，在管教中挣扎反抗，就拦阻了神施怜悯的管道，无法回转归向神。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「祢竟全然弃绝我们」（22节），这句话实在太沉重了，所以在犹太会堂里公开宣读本书时，会在读完第22节之后，把第21节再读一遍，以便用更加积极和充满希望的语调结束本书。犹太教在朗读《传道书》、《以赛亚书》、《耶利米哀歌》和《玛拉基书》时，都会采取这种回避现实、自欺欺人的态度；所以直到今天，他们还在等候那位想象中的弥赛亚，却拒绝承认那位不符合他们想象的耶稣基督。

and Joseph\u0026rsquo;s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.\n7:14 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.\n7:15 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,\n7:16 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.\n7:17 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,\n7:18 Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.\n7:19 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.\n7:20 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father\u0026rsquo;s house three months:\n7:21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.\n7:22 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.\n7:23 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.\n7:24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:\n7:25 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.\n7:26 And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?\n7:27 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?\n7:28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?\n7:29 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.\n7:30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.\n7:31 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,\n7:32 Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.\n7:33 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.\n7:34 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.\n7:35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.\n7:36 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.\n7:37 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.\n7:38 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:\n7:39 To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,\n7:40 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.\n7:41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.\n7:42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?\n7:43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.\n7:44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.\n7:45 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;\n7:46 Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.\n7:47 But Solomon built him an house.\n7:48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,\n7:49 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?\n7:50 Hath not my hand made all these things?\n7:51 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.\n7:52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:\n7:53 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.\n7:54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.\n7:55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,\n7:56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.\n7:57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,\n7:58 And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man\u0026rsquo;s feet, whose name was Saul.\n7:59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\n7:60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.\n\r7:1 大祭司就说、这些事果然有么。\n7:2 司提反说、诸位父兄请听。当日我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕在米所波大米还未住哈兰的时候、荣耀的　神向他显现、\n7:3 对他说、『你要离开本地和亲族、往我所要指示你的地方去。』\n7:4 他就离开迦勒底人之地住在哈兰。他父亲死了以后、　神使他从那里搬到你们现在所住之地。\n7:5 在这地方　神并没有给他产业、连立足之地也没有给他。但应许要将这地赐给他和他的后裔为业。那时他还没有儿子。\n7:6 神说、他的后裔、必寄居外邦、那里的人、要叫他们作奴仆、苦待他们四百年。\n7:7 神又说、使他们作奴仆的那国、我要惩罚、以后他们要出来、在这地方事奉我。\n7:8 神又赐他割礼的约。于是亚伯拉罕生了以撒、第八日给他行了割礼。以撒生雅各、雅各生十二位先祖。\n7:9 先祖嫉妒约瑟、把他卖到埃及去。　神却与他同在、\n7:10 救他脱离一切苦难、又使他在埃及王法老面前、得恩典有智慧。法老就派他作埃及国的宰相兼管全家。\n7:11 后来埃及和迦南全地遭遇饥荒、大受艰难、我们的祖宗、就绝了粮。\n7:12 雅各听见在埃及有粮、就打发我们的祖宗、初次往那里去。\n7:13 第二次约瑟与弟兄们相认、他的亲族也被法老知道了。\n7:14 约瑟就打发弟兄请父亲雅各、和全家七十五个人都来。\n7:15 于是雅各下了埃及、后来他和我们的祖宗都死在那里。\n7:16 又被带到示剑、葬于亚伯拉罕在示剑用银子从哈抹子孙买来的坟墓里。\n7:17 及至　神应许亚伯拉罕的日期将到、以色列民在埃及兴盛众多、\n7:18 直到有不晓得约瑟的新王兴起。\n7:19 他用诡计待我们的宗族、苦害我们的祖宗、叫他们丢弃婴孩、使婴孩不能存活。\n7:20 那时、摩西生下来、俊美非凡、在他父亲家里抚养了三个月。\n7:21 他被丢弃的时候、法老的女儿拾了去、养为自己的儿子。\n7:22 摩西学了埃及人一切的学问、说话行事、都有才能。\n7:23 他将到四十岁、心中起意、去看望他的弟兄以色列人。\n7:24 到了那里、见他们一个人受冤屈、就护庇他、为那受欺压的人报仇、打死了那埃及人。\n7:25 他以为弟兄必明白　神是借他的手搭救他们。他们却不明白。\n7:26 第二天、遇见两个以色列人争斗、就劝他们和睦、说、你们二位是弟兄、为甚么彼此欺负呢。\n7:27 那欺负邻舍的、把他推开说、『谁立你作我们的首领、和审判官呢。\n7:28 难道你要杀我、像昨天杀那埃及人么。』\n7:29 摩西听见这话就逃走了、寄居于米甸。在那里生了两个儿子。\n7:30 过了四十年、在西乃山的旷野、有一位天使、从荆棘火焰中、向摩西显现。\n7:31 摩西见了那异象、便觉希奇。正进前观看的时候、有主的声音说、\n7:32 『我是你列祖的　神、就是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神。』摩西战战兢兢、不敢观看。\n7:33 主对他说、『把你脚上的鞋脱下来。因为你所站之地是圣地。\n7:34 我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦、我实在看见了。他们悲叹的声音、我也听见了。我下来要救他们、你来、我要差你往埃及去。』\n7:35 这摩西、就是百姓弃绝说、谁立你作我们的首领、和审判官的。　神却借那在荆棘中显现之使者的手、差派他作首领、作救赎的。\n7:36 这人领百姓出来、在埃及、在红海、在旷野、四十年间行了奇事神迹。\n7:37 那曾对以色列人说、『　神要从你们弟兄中间、给你们兴起一位先知像我的、』就是这位摩西。\n7:38 这人曾在旷野会中、和西乃山上与那对他说话的天使同在、又与我们的祖宗同在、并且领受活泼的圣言传给我们。\n7:39 我们的祖宗不肯听从、反弃绝他、心里归向埃及、\n7:40 对亚伦说、『你且为我们造些神像、在我们前面引路。因为领我们出埃及地的那个摩西、我们不知道他遭了甚么事。』\n7:41 那时、他们造了一个牛犊、又拿祭物献给那像、欢喜自己手中的工作。\n7:42 神就转脸不顾、任凭他们事奉天上的日月星辰、正如先知书上所写的说、『以色列家阿、你们四十年间在旷野、岂是将牺牲和祭物献给我么。\n7:43 你们抬着摩洛的帐幕、和理番神的星。就是你们所造为要敬拜的像。因此、我要把你们迁到巴比伦外去。』\n7:44 我们的祖宗在旷野、有法柜的帐幕、是　神吩咐摩西叫他照所看见的样式作的。\n7:45 这帐幕、我们的祖宗相继承受、当　神在他们面前赶出外邦人去的时候、他们同约书亚把帐幕搬进承受为业之地、直存到大卫的日子。\n7:46 大卫在　神面前蒙恩、祈求为雅各的　神预备居所。\n7:47 却是所罗门为　神造成殿宇。\n7:48 其实至高者并不住人手所造的。就如先知所言、\n7:49 『主说、天是我的座位、地是我的脚凳。你们要为我造何等的殿宇、那里是我安息的地方呢。\n7:50 这一切不都是我手所造的么。』\n7:51 你们这硬着颈项、心与耳未受割礼的人、常时抗拒圣灵。你们的祖宗怎样、你们也怎样。\n7:52 那一个先知、不是你们祖宗逼迫呢。他们也把预先传说那义者要来的人杀了。如今你们又把那义者卖了、杀了。\n7:53 你们受了天使所传的律法、竟不遵守 7:54 众人听见这话、就极其恼怒、向司提反咬牙切齿。\n7:55 但司提反被圣灵充满、定睛望天、看见　神的荣耀、又看见耶稣站在　神的右边。\n7:56 就说、我看见天开了、人子站在　神的右边。\n7:57 众人大声喊叫、摀着耳朵、齐心拥上前去。\n7:58 把他推到城外、用石头打他。作见证的人、把衣裳放在一个少年人名叫扫罗的脚前。\n7:59 他们正用石头打的时候、司提反呼吁主说、求主耶稣接收我的灵魂。\n7:60 又跪下大声喊着说、主阿、不要将这罪归于他们。说了这话、就睡了。扫罗也喜悦他被害。\n"},{"id":89,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/119_Hebrews/hebrews_07/","title":"Hebrews 07","section":"Hebrews","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;\n7:2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all;

but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.\n7:4 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.\n7:5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:\n7:6 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.\n7:7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.\n7:8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.\n7:9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.\n7:10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.\n7:11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?\n7:12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.\n7:13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.\n7:14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.\n7:15 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,\n7:16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.\n7:17 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.\n7:18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.\n7:19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.\n7:20 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:\n7:21 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)\n7:22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.\n7:23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:\n7:24 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.\n7:25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.\n7:26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;\n7:27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people\u0026rsquo;s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.\n7:28 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity;

And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.\n8:2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.\n8:3 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.\n8:4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.\n8:5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.\n8:6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.\n8:7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.\n8:8 And there was great joy in that city.\n8:9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:\n8:10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.\n8:11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.\n8:12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.\n8:13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.\n8:14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:\n8:15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: verse 15: It was studied at the LBC on 2023.04.18 - Tuesday night, Chinese Bible study.\n8:16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)\n8:17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.\n8:18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,\n8:19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.\n8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.\n8:21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.\n8:22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.\n8:23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.\n8:24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.\n8:25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.\n8:26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.\n8:27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,\n8:28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.\n8:29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.\n8:30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?\n8:31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.\n8:32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:\n8:33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.\n8:34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?\n8:35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.\n8:36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?\n8:37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\n8:38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.\n8:39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.\n8:40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.\n\r8:1 从这日起、耶路撒冷的教会、大遭逼迫。除了使徒以外、门徒都分散在犹太和撒玛利亚各处。\n8:2 有虔诚的人、把司提反埋葬了、为他捶胸大哭。\n8:3 扫罗却残害教会、进各人的家、拉着男女下在监里。\n8:4 那些分散的人、往各处去传道。\n8:5 腓利下撒玛利亚城去、宣讲基督。\n8:6 众人听见了、又看见腓利所行的神迹、就同心合意的听从他的话。\n8:7 因为有许多人被污鬼附着、那些鬼大声呼叫、从他们身上出来。还有许多瘫痪的、瘸腿的、都得了医治。\n8:8 在那城里、就大有欢喜。\n8:9 有一个人、名叫西门、向来在那城里行邪术、妄自尊大、使撒玛利亚的百姓惊奇。\n8:10 无论大小、都听从他、说、这人就是那称为　神的大能者。\n8:11 他们听从他、因他久用邪术、使他们惊奇。\n8:12 及至他们信了腓利所传　神国的福音、和耶稣基督的名、连男带女就受了洗。\n8:13 西门自己也信了。既受了洗、就常与腓利在一处。看见他所行的神迹和大异能、就甚惊奇。\n8:14 使徒在耶路撒冷、听见撒玛利亚人领受了　神的道、就打发彼得约翰往他们那里去。\n8:15 两个人到了、就为他们祷告、要叫他们受圣灵。\n8:16 因为圣灵还没有降在他们一个人身上。他们只奉主耶稣的名受了洗。\n8:17 于是使徒按手在他们头上、他们就受了圣灵。\n8:18 西门看见使徒按手、便有圣灵赐下。就拿钱给使徒、\n8:19 说、把这权柄也给我、叫我手按着谁、谁就可以受圣灵。\n8:20 彼得说、你的银子、和你一同灭亡吧。因你想　神的恩赐、是可以用钱买的。\n8:21 你在这道上、无分无关。因为在　神面前、你的心不正。\n8:22 你当懊悔你这罪恶、祈求主。或者你心里的意念可得赦免。\n8:23 我看出你正在苦胆之中、被罪恶捆绑。\n8:24 西门说、愿你们为我求主、叫你们所说的、没有一样临到我身上。\n8:25 使徒既证明主道、而且传讲、就回耶路撒冷去、一路在撒玛利亚好些村庄传扬福音。\n8:26 有主的一个使者对腓利说、起来、向南走、往那从耶路撒冷下迦萨的路上去。那路是旷野。\n8:27 腓利就起身去了。不料、有一个埃提阿伯〔即古实见以赛亚十八章一节〕人、是个有大权的太监、在埃提阿伯女王干大基的手下总管银库、他上耶路撒冷礼拜去了。\n8:28 现在回来、在车上坐着、念先知以赛亚的书。\n8:29 圣灵对腓利说、你去贴近那车走。\n8:30 腓利就跑到太监那里、听见他念先知以赛亚的书、便问他说、你所念的、你明白么。\n8:31 他说、没有人指教我、怎能明白呢。于是请腓利上车、与他同坐。\n8:32 他所念的那段经、说、『他像羊被牵到宰杀之地、又像羊羔在剪毛的人手下无声、他也是这样不开口。\n8:33 他卑微的时候、人不按公义审判他。〔原文作他的审判被夺去〕谁能述说他的世代、因为他的生命从地上夺去。』\n8:34 太监对腓利说、请问、先知说这话、是指着谁、是指着自己呢、是指着别人呢。\n8:35 腓利就开口从这经上起、对他传讲耶稣。\n8:36 二人正往前走、到了有水的地方。太监说、看哪、这里有水、我受洗有甚么妨碍呢。〔有古卷在此有 8:37 腓利说、你若是一心相信、就可以。他回答说我信耶稣基督是　神的儿子〕 8:38 于是吩咐车站住、腓利和太监二人同下水里去、腓利就给他施洗。\n8:39 从水里上来、主的灵把腓利提了去、太监也不再见他了、就欢欢喜喜的走路。\n8:40 后来有人在亚锁都遇见腓利、他走遍那地方、在各城宣传福音、直到该撒利亚。\n\rverse 15 The baptism of the holy Spirit: Brother K. Y.: This is one occasion in the early church where we believe that God wanted to show that all who believe in Christ will receive the Holy Spirit as is told us in the Epistles. Irrespective of whether they are Jew or Samaritan as the early Jewish believers may doubt if the Samaritans can be part of the church. So when the apostles prayed and the Samaritan believers received the Holy Spirit it showed to everyone that all who are in Christ is part of the Church and have the Holy Spirit.\nAfter this occasion we know that as the new testament epistles tell us, all believer are sealed with the Holy Spirit the moment they believe.\nBut ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. (Romans 8:9 KJV)\nBelievers today receive the Holy Spirit at the point they put their trust in Christ and confess him as Saviour and Lord. Baptism has nothing to do with receiving of the Holy Spirit. Even though a believer may be baptised 2 year after believing and trusting the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour. The believer already is indwelled by the Holy Spirit at the point of believing 2 years ago. The moment a person believes in Christ the Holy Spirit comes and lives in Him.\n\n~~~\nBrother L. L.: In history, Jews and Samaritans hated each other. Most Jews would not travel through Samaria. They went by a longer route to avoid Samaria and any contact with Samaritans.\nIt was the first step that God called Philip, a Jew, to preach Jesus in the city of Samaria. As a result, the Samaritan believers got baptized in water (verse 12).\nIt was the second step that God called Peter and John, Jews, to laid their hands upon Samaritans and pray for their receiving the holy Spirit.\nGod orchestrated the baptism with the interactions between Philip, Peter, and John with Samaritans so that the relationship between Jews and Samaritans can be built up, and that both Jews and Samaritans can join in one body of God.\n\n~~~\nBelievers' Bible commentary by W. MacDonald\n8:14-17 When news that Samaria had avidly received the word reached the apostles \u0026hellip; at Jerusalem, they sent Peter and John to them. By the time they arrived, the believers had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, but they had not received the Holy Spirit. Obviously acting in accordance with divine guidance, the apostles prayed that these believers might receive the Holy Spirit and laid their hands on them. As soon as this was done, they received the Holy Spirit.\nThis immediately raises the question, “Why the difference between the order of events here and on the day of Pentecost?” At Pentecost the Jewish people:\n1. Repented.\n2. Were baptized.\n3. Received the Holy Spirit.\nHere the Samaritans:\n1. Believed.\n2. Were baptized.\n3. Had the apostles pray for them and lay their hands on them.\n4. Received the Holy Spirit.\nOf one thing we can be sure: they were all saved in the same way—by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the only Way of Salvation. However, during this transitional time, bridging Judaism and Christianity, God chose to act sovereignly in connection with various communities of believers. Jewish believers were asked to dissociate themselves from the nation of Israel by baptism before they received the Spirit. Now the Samaritans must have special prayer and the apostles' hands laid on them. But why?\nPerhaps the best answer is that it was intended to give expression to the unity of the church, whether made up of Jews or Samaritans. There was a real danger that the church in Jerusalem might retain ideas of Jewish superiority, and that they might continue to have no dealings with their Samaritan brethren. To avoid the possibility of schism, or the thought of two churches (one Jewish and one Samaritan), God sent the apostles to lay their hands on the Samaritans. This expressed full fellowship with them as believers in the Lord Jesus. They were all members of one body, all one in Christ Jesus.\n\n~~~\nJohn Darby\u0026rsquo;s commentary Philip however went down to Samaria, and preached Christ to them, and wrought miracles. They all give heed to him and are even baptised. A man who until then had bewitched them with sorcery, so that they had said he was the great power of God, even he also submits to the power which eclipsed his false marvels, and convinced him so much the more of its reality as he was conscious of the falseness of his own. The apostles make no difficulty with regard to Samaria. The history of Jesus must have enlightened them in that respect. Moreover, the Samaritans were not Gentiles. Still it was a Hellenist who preached the gospel there. A new truth comes out here in connection with the regular process of the assembly — namely, that the apostles conferred the Holy Ghost by means of prayer and the laying on of hands: a very important fact in the history of God\u0026rsquo;s dealings. Moreover Samaria was a conquest which all the energy of Judaism had never been able to make. It was a new and splendid triumph for the gospel. Spiritual energy to subdue the world appertained to the assembly. Jerusalem was set aside: its day was over in that respect.\n\n~~~\nMatthew Henry\u0026rsquo;s commentary How they advanced and improved those of them that were sincere. It is said (Acts 8:16), The Holy Ghost was as yet fallen upon none of them, in those extraordinary powers which were conveyed by the descent of the Spirit upon the day of pentecost. They were none of them endued with the gift of tongues, which seems then to have been the most usual immediate effect of the pouring out of the Spirit. See Acts 10:45, Acts 10:46. This was both an eminent sign to those that believed not, and of excellent service to those that did. This, and other such gifts, they had not, only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, and so engaged in him and interested in him, which was necessary to salvation, and in this they had joy and satisfaction (Acts 10:8), though they could not speak with tongues. Those that are indeed given up to Christ, and have experienced the sanctifying influences and operations of the Spirit of grace, have great reason to be thankful, and no reason to complain, though they have not those gifts that are for ornament, and would make them bright. But it is intended that they should go on to the perfection of the present dispensation, for the greater honour of the gospel. We have reason to think that Philip had received these gifts of the Holy Ghost himself, but had not a power to confer them; the apostles must come to do this; and they did it not upon all that were baptized, but upon some of them, and, it should seem, such as were designed for some office in the church, or at least to be eminent active members of it; and upon some of them one gift of the Holy Ghost, and upon others another. See 1 Co 12:4, 1 Co 12:8; 1 Co 14:26. Now in order to this, 1. The apostles prayed for them, Acts 8:15. The Spirit is given, not to ourselves only (Luke 11:13), but to others also, in answer to prayer: I will put my Spirit within you (Eze 36:27), but I will for this be enquired of, Acts 8:37. We may take encouragement from this example in praying to God to give the renewing graces of the Holy Ghost to those whose spiritual welfare we are concerned for - for our children, for our friends, for our ministers. We should pray, and pray earnestly, that they may receive the Holy Ghost; for this includes all blessings. 2. They laid their hands on them, to signify that their prayers were answered, and that the gift of the Holy Ghost was conferred upon them; for, upon the use of this sign, they received the Holy Ghost, and spoke with tongues. The laying on of hands was anciently used in blessing, by those who blessed with authority.

如今那些在基督耶稣里的、就不定罪了。\n8:2 因为赐生命圣灵的律、在基督耶稣里释放了我、使我脱离罪和死的律了。\n8:3 律法既因肉体软弱、有所不能行的、　神就差遣自己的儿子、成为罪身的形状、作了赎罪祭、在肉体中定了罪案。\n8:4 使律法的义、成就在我们这不随从肉体、只随从圣灵的人身上。\n8:5 因为随从肉体的人、体贴肉体的事。随从圣灵的人、体贴圣灵的事。\n8:6 体贴肉体的就是死。体贴圣灵的乃是生命平安。\n8:7 原来体贴肉体的、就是与　神为仇。因为不服　神的律法、也是不能服。\n8:8 而且属肉体的人、不能得　神的喜欢。\n8:9 如果　神的灵住在你们心里、你们就不属肉体、乃属圣灵了。人若没有基督的灵、就不是属基督的。\n8:10 基督若在你们心里、身体就因罪而死、心灵却因义而活。\n8:11 然而叫耶稣从死里复活者的灵、若住在你们心里、那叫基督耶稣从死里复活的、也必借着住在你们心里的圣灵、使你们必死的身体又活过来。\n8:12 弟兄们、这样看来、我们并不是欠肉体的债、去顺从肉体活着。\n8:13 你们若顺从肉体活着必要死。若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行必要活着。\n8:14 因为凡被　神的灵引导的、都是　神的儿子。\n8:15 你们所受的不是奴仆的心、仍旧害怕。所受的乃是儿子的心、因此我们呼叫阿爸、父。\n8:16 圣灵与我们的心同证我们是　神的儿女。\n8:17 既是儿女、便是后嗣、就是　神的后嗣、和基督同作后嗣。如果我们和他一同受苦、也必和他一同得荣耀。\n8:18 我想现在的苦楚、若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀、就不足介意了。\n8:19 受造之物、切望等候　神的众子显出来。\n8:20 因为受造之物服在虚空之下、不是自己愿意、乃是因那叫他如此的。\n8:21 但受造之物仍然指望脱离败坏的辖制、得享　神儿女自由的荣耀。〔享原文作入〕\n8:22 我们知道一切受造之物、一同叹息劳苦、直到如今。\n8:23 不但如此、就是我们这有圣灵初结果子的、也是自己心里叹息、等候得着儿子的名分、乃是我们的身体得赎。\n8:24 我们得救是在乎盼望。只是所见的盼望不是盼望。谁还盼望他所见的呢。〔有古卷作人所看见的何必再盼望呢〕\n8:25 但我们若盼望那所不见的、就必忍耐等候。\n8:26 况且我们的软弱有圣灵帮助、我们本不晓得当怎样祷告、只是圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息、替我们祷告。\n8:27 鉴察人心的、晓得圣灵的意思。因为圣灵照着　神的旨意替圣徒祈求。\n8:28 我们晓得万事都互相效力、叫爱　神的人得益处、就是按他旨意被召的人。\n8:29 因为他预先所知道的人、就预先定下效法他儿子的模样，使他儿子在许多弟兄中作长子。\n8:30 预先所定下的人又召他们来。所召来的人、又称他们为义。所称为义的人、又叫他们得荣耀。\n8:31 既是这样、还有甚么说的呢。　神若帮助我们、谁能敌挡我们呢。\n8:32 神既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了、岂不也把万物和他一同白白的赐给我们么。\n8:33 谁能控告　神所拣选的人呢。有　神称他们为义了。〔或作是称他们为义的　神么〕\n8:34 谁能定他们的罪呢。有基督耶稣已经死了、而且从死里复活、现今在　神的右边、也替我们祈求。〔有基督云云或作是已经死了而且从死里复活现今在　神的右边也替我们祈求的基督耶稣么〕\n8:35 谁能使我们与基督的爱隔绝呢。难道是患难么、是困苦么、是逼迫么、是饥饿么、是赤身露体么、是危险么、是刀剑么。\n8:36 如经上所记、『我们为你的缘故、终日被杀。人看我们如将宰的羊。』\n8:37 然而靠着爱我们的主、在这一切的事上、已经得胜有余了。\n8:38 因为我深信无论是死、是生、是天使、是掌权的、是有能的、是现在的事、是将来的事、\n8:39 是高处的、是低处的、是别的受造之物、都不能叫我们与　神的爱隔绝。这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。\n\r"},{"id":95,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/020_Proverbs/Prov_08/","title":"Proverbs 8","section":"Proverbs","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r8:1

And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.\n9:11 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,\n9:12 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.\n9:13 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:\n9:14 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.\n9:15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:\n9:16 For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name\u0026rsquo;s sake.\n9:17 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.\n9:18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.\n9:19 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.\n9:20 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.\n9:21 But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?\n9:22 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.\n9:23 And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:\n9:24 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.\n9:25 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.\n9:26 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.\n9:27 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.\n9:28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.\n9:29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.\n9:30 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.\n9:31 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.\n9:32 And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.\n9:33 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.\n9:34 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.\n9:35 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.\n9:36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.\n9:37 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.\n9:38 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.\n9:39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.\n9:40 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.\n9:41 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.\n9:42 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.\n9:43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.\n\r9:1 扫罗仍然向主的门徒、口吐威吓凶杀的话、去见大祭司、\n9:2 求文书给大马色的各会堂、若是找着信奉这道的人、无论男女、都准他捆绑带到耶路撒冷。\n9:3 扫罗行路、将到大马色、忽然从天上发光、四面照着他。\n9:4 他就仆倒在地、听见有声音对他说、扫罗、扫罗、你为甚么逼迫我。\n9:5 他说、主阿、你是谁。主说、我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。\n9:6 起来、进城去、你所当作的事、必有人告诉你。\n9:7 同行的人、站在那里、说不出话来、听见声音、却看不见人。\n9:8 扫罗从地上起来、睁开眼睛、竟不能看见甚么。有人拉他的手、领他进了大马色。\n9:9 三日不能看见、也不吃、也不喝。\n9:10 当下在大马色、有一个门徒、名叫亚拿尼亚。主在异象中对他说、亚拿尼亚。他说、主、我在这里。\n9:11 主对他说、起来、往直街去、在犹大的家里、访问一个大数人名叫扫罗。他正祷告。\n9:12 又看见了一个人、名叫亚拿尼亚、进来按手在他身上、叫他能看见。\n9:13 亚拿尼亚回答说、主阿、我听见许多人说、这人怎样在耶路撒冷多多苦害你的圣徒。\n9:14 并且他在这里有从祭司长得来的权柄捆绑一切求告你名的人。\n9:15 主对亚拿尼亚说、你只管去。他是我所拣选的器皿、要在外邦人和君王并以色列人面前、宣扬我的名。\n9:16 我也要指示他、为我的名必须受许多的苦难。\n9:17 亚拿尼亚就去了、进入那家、把手按在扫罗身上说、兄弟扫罗、在你来的路上、向你显现的主、就是耶稣、打发我来、叫你能看见、又被圣灵充满。\n9:18 扫罗的眼睛上、好像有鳞立刻掉下来、他就能看见、于是起来受了洗。\n9:19 吃过饭就健壮了。扫罗和大马色的门徒同住了些日子。\n9:20 就在各会堂里宣传耶稣、说他是　神的儿子。\n9:21 凡听见的人、都惊奇说、在耶路撒冷残害求告这名的、不是这人么。并且他到这里来、特要捆绑他们带到祭司长那里。\n9:22 但扫罗越发有能力、驳倒住大马色的犹太人、证明耶稣是基督。\n9:23 过了好些日子、犹太人商议要杀扫罗。\n9:24 但他们的计谋、被扫罗知道了。他们又昼夜在城门守候要杀他。\n9:25 他的门徒就在夜间、用筐子把他从城墙上缒下去。\n9:26 扫罗到了耶路撒冷、想与门徒结交。他们却都怕他、不信他是门徒。\n9:27 惟有巴拿巴接待他、领去见使徒、把他在路上怎么看见主、主怎么向他说话、他在大马色、怎么奉耶稣的名放胆传道、都述说出来。\n9:28 于是扫罗在耶路撒冷、和门徒出入来往、\n9:29 奉主的名、放胆传道。并与说希利尼话的犹太人、讲论辩驳。他们却想法子要杀他。\n9:30 弟兄们知道了就送他下该撒利亚、打发他往大数去。\n9:31 那时犹太、加利利、撒玛利亚、各处的教会都得平安、被建立。凡事敬畏主、蒙圣灵的安慰、人数就增多了。\n9:32 彼得周流四方的时候、也到了居住吕大的圣徒那里。\n9:33 遇见一个人、名叫以尼雅、得了瘫痪、在褥子上躺卧八年。\n9:34 彼得对他说、以尼雅、耶稣基督医好你了。起来、收拾你的褥子。他就立刻起来了。\n9:35 凡住吕大和沙仑的人、都看见了他、就归服主。\n9:36 在约帕有一个女徒、名叫大比大、翻希利尼话、就是多加。〔多加就是羚羊的意思〕他广行善事、多施赒济。\n9:37 当时、他患病而死。有人把他洗了、停在楼上。\n9:38 吕大原与约帕相近。门徒听见彼得在那里、就打发两个人去见他、央求他说、快到我们那里去、不要耽延。\n9:39 彼得就起身和他们同去。到了、便有人领他上楼。众寡妇都站在彼得旁边哭、拿多加与他们同在时、所做的里衣外衣给他看。\n9:40 彼得叫他们都出去、就跪下祷告、转身对着死人说、大比大、起来、他就睁开眼睛、见了彼得、便坐起来。\n9:41 彼得伸手扶他起来、叫众圣徒和寡妇进去、把多加活活的交给他们。\n9:42 这事传遍了约帕、就有许多人信了主。\n9:43 此后彼得在约帕一个硝皮匠西门的家里、住了多日。\n"},{"id":99,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/119_Hebrews/hebrews_09/","title":"Hebrews 09","section":"Hebrews","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r9:1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.\n9:2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.\n9:3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;\n9:4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron\u0026rsquo;s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;\n9:5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.\n9:6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.\n9:7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:\n9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:\n9:9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;\n9:10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.\n9:11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;\n9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.\n9:13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:\n9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?\n9:15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.\n9:16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.\n9:17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.\n9:18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.\n9:19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,\n9:20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.\n9:21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.\n9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.\n9:23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.\n9:24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true;

and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.\n\r9:1 原来前约有礼拜的条例、和属世界的圣幕。\n9:2 因为有预备的帐幕、头一层叫作圣所。里面有灯台、桌子、和陈设饼。\n9:3 第二幔子后、又有一层帐幕、叫作至圣所。\n9:4 有金香炉、〔炉或作坛〕有包金的约柜、柜里有盛吗哪的金罐、和亚伦发过芽的杖、并两块约版。\n9:5 柜上面有荣耀基路伯的影罩着施恩座。〔施恩原文作蔽罪〕这几件我现在不能一一细说。\n9:6 这些物件既如此预备齐了、众祭司就常进头一层帐幕、行拜　神的礼。\n9:7 至于第二层帐幕、惟有大祭司一年一次独自进去、没有不带着血、为自己和百姓的过错献上。\n9:8 圣灵用此指明、头一层帐幕仍存的时候、进入至圣所的路还未显明。\n9:9 那头一层帐幕作现今的一个表样、所献的礼物和祭物、就着良心说、都不能叫礼拜的人得以完全。\n9:10 这些事连那饮食和诸般洗濯的规矩、都不过是属肉体的条例、命定到振兴的时候为止。\n9:11 但现在基督已经来到、作了将来美事的大祭司、经过那更大更全备的帐幕、不是人手所造也不是属乎这世界的。\n9:12 并且不用山羊和牛犊的血、乃用自己的血、只一次进入圣所、成了永远赎罪的事。\n9:13 若山羊和公牛的血、并母牛犊的灰、洒在不洁的人身上、尚且叫人成圣、身体洁净。\n9:14 何况基督借着永远的灵、将自己无瑕无疵献给　神、他的血岂不更能洗净你们的心〔原文作良心〕除去你们的死行、使你们事奉那永生　神么。\n9:15 为此他作了新约的中保。既然受死赎了人在前约之时所犯的罪过、便叫蒙召之人得着所应许永远的产业。\n9:16 凡有遗命、必须等到留遗命的人死了。〔遗命原文与约字同〕 9:17 因为人死了、遗命才有效力、若留遗命的尚在、那遗命还有用处么。\n9:18 所以前约也不是不用血立的。\n9:19 因为摩西当日照着律法、将各样诫命传给众百姓、就拿朱红色绒和牛膝草、把牛犊山羊的血和水、洒在书上、又洒在众百姓身上、说、\n9:20 『这血就是　神与你们立约的凭据。』\n9:21 他又照样把血洒在帐幕、和各样器皿上。\n9:22 按着律法、凡物差不多都是用血洁净的、若不流血、罪就不得赦免了。\n9:23 照着天上样式作的物件、必须用这些祭物去洁净。但那天上的本物、自然当用更美的祭物去洁净。\n9:24 因为基督并不是进了人手所造的圣所、（这不过是真圣所的影像)乃是进了天堂、如今为我们显在　神面前。\n9:25 也不是多次将自己献上、像那大祭司每年带着牛羊的血进入圣所。〔牛羊的血原文作不是自己的血〕\n9:26 如果这样、他从创世以来、就必多次受苦了。但如今在这末世显现一次、把自己献为祭、好除掉罪。\n9:27 按着定命、人人都有一死、死后且有审判。\n9:28 像这样、基督既然一次被献、担当了多人的罪、将来要向那等候他的人第二次显现、并与罪无关、乃是为拯救他们。\n"},{"id":100,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/101_Matthew/Mat_09/","title":"Matthew 9","section":"Matthew","content":" KJV\r和合本\rv14-17 Commentary\rv14-17 Thoughts\r\r\r\r对禁食礼仪的挑战 9:14-17\n对观经文：可 2:18-22 路 5:32-39\n路 5:30 的记载可看出发问者是法利赛人，而马太记载是约翰的门徒来询问，因此这件事情可能是约翰的门徒和法利赛人一起来质疑耶稣不但不禁食，还与罪人同吃喝。\n（一）施洗约翰的门徒来见耶稣，质疑耶稣的门徒不像法利赛人与约翰的门徒一样常常禁食。(9:14)\n●「那时」：SG 5119，「在那时候」、「然后」，可能就是筵席举行之时，而按可 2:18 的记载，当时法利赛人和施洗约翰的门徒正在禁食。\n●「禁食」：SG 3522，「禁戒食物和饮料的宗教仪式」，摩西律法规定百姓一年一次（赎罪日）禁食，表示为罪痛悔 (利 23:27)。日后犹太人增添了其他纪念国难的禁食日 (斯 9:31, 亚 7:5, 8:19)。耶稣时代法利赛人一周禁食两次，在周一和周四禁食，施洗约翰的门徒亦用禁食表明他们悔改的心志。\n（二）耶稣以时间与场合不合适来解释为什么现在门徒不禁食。 (9:15)\n●「新郎」：SG 3566，耶稣自称新郎，可能是把自己看为是旧约 赛 62:5 何 2:19 的「新郎」，也就是与以色列人立了约的上帝。另外施洗约翰也称耶稣是新郎 约 3:29 。\n●「陪伴之人」：SG 3588+SG 5207+SG 3588+SG 3567，直译是「洞房之子」，意思是「婚礼的宾客」。在此应该是指「门徒」。\n●「要离开他们」：直译是「从他们被带走」、「从他们中间除去」，可能有暗示自己将被取去性命的意思。\n当耶稣与门徒同在时应当欢喜快乐，而非禁食。但当耶稣离开他们之时，禁食是合宜的表现。而在 约 3:22-30 中，施洗约翰把耶稣比成新郎，因此耶稣在此用施洗约翰的教训来回答施洗约翰的门徒，应该是很有说服力的。 显然法利赛人以禁食为敬虔的应有表现，而不顾禁食应有的内涵。但耶稣的回答显示他深知禁食的内涵。如果不是真心的伤心，又何必装成吃不下饭呢？\n（三）耶稣以新布与旧衣服、新酒与旧皮袋来说明新生命与旧传统难以相容。 9:16-17\n●「新」布：SG 46，「未缩水的」、「未加工的」、「新的」。\n● 旧「衣服」：SG 2440，「服饰」、「外袍」。\n「新布与旧衣服」：旧衣服已经缩水过了，而新布还没有缩过水，所以补在一起时，新布将缩水把旧衣服抓破了。\n●「新」酒：SG 3501，「年轻的」、「年幼的」。\n「新酒与旧皮袋」：当时用羊皮袋装酒，当新鲜的葡萄汁发酵成酒时，会产生气体，而新皮袋可随着伸展膨胀。但旧皮袋是已经膨胀过的，所以会被胀破。\n这些比喻都是表示耶稣带来的新启示是与传统的「仪式主义」不合的。然而传统的影响力还是十分惊人，大多数人还是选择传统。我们有什么文化或信仰传统是敌对真理的吗？\n来源：马太福音 9章14节 到 9章17节\n 旧约中，通常在叁种情形下禁食：\n第一：是当百姓犯罪悔改时，像君王或大祭司等领袖，披麻蒙灰禁食，最有名的就是尼尼微人。\n第二：是人为了某件事，求神应许。\n第叁：是律法规定某些节日需要禁食，这是法条的规定。\n在新约中，主耶稣被圣灵领到旷野，禁食了40天。耶稣禁食的原因，既不是为了苦难而求神应许，也不是为了犯罪悔改、或是律法规定，而是为了寻求神。因此我们知道禁食的另一种原因，就是要寻求神的旨意。\n禁食的另一个原因，在《马太福音》十七章19-21节，耶稣的门徒出去赶鬼的时候，有些鬼赶不走，「耶稣说：是因为你们的信心小；我实在告诉你们，你们若有信心像一粒芥菜种，就是对这座山说：你从这边挪到那边，它也必挪去；并且你们没有一件不能作的事了。至于这一类的鬼，若不祷告禁食，他就不出来。」\n从这句话我们知道，禁食也是一种「力量」，会有一个出乎你意料之外的力量，所以我们为某一件事情，不一定是赶鬼，也可以禁食。\n来源：基督教今日报 | 基督徒为什么要「禁食」？什么情况需要？\n 参考资料：\n来源：金灯台 | 禁食的正解 吴主光著\n\rThe problem of Pharisee: 2 Tim 3:5 NLV holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof: from these also turn away.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t laugh at Pharisee but examine ourselves.

This is not an anticlimax, but a great revelation of God.\nWe have a tendency to look for wonder in our experience, and we mistake heroic actions for real heroes. It’s one thing to go through a crisis grandly, yet quite another to go through every day glorifying God when there is no witness, no limelight, and no one paying even the remotest attention to us. If we are not looking for halos, we at least want something that will make people say, “What a wonderful man of prayer he is!” or, “What a great woman of devotion she is!” If you are properly devoted to the Lord Jesus, you have reached the lofty height where no one would ever notice you personally. All that is noticed is the power of God coming through you all the time.\nWe want to be able to say, “Oh, I have had a wonderful call from God!” But to do even the most humbling tasks to the glory of God takes the Almighty God Incarnate working in us. To be utterly unnoticeable requires God’s Spirit in us making us absolutely humanly His. The true test of a saint’s life is not successfulness but faithfulness on the human level of life. We tend to set up success in Christian work as our purpose, but our purpose should be to display the glory of God in human life, to live a life “hidden with Christ in God” in our everyday human conditions (Colossians 3:3). Our human relationships are the very conditions in which the ideal life of God should be exhibited.\nsource: My Utmost for His Highest - Still Human\n 仍然是人 无论作什么，都要为荣耀神而行。（林前十31）\n道成肉身的超其，湮没在平凡的童年生活；登山变象的辉煌光彩，消失在鬼附的山谷间；复活的荣耀，降卑成为海旁早餐。这不是反高潮，而是神极大的启示。\n我们总有一种倾向，就是想去追求超奇的经历；错把英雄感当作英雄。在重大关头昂然度过是一回事，在每天生活中荣耀神，没有人作证，没有光彩，丝毫没有被注意，又是另一回事。我们有时虽然不求中世纪那种圣人的光环，也想做些事令人家说：[看他是个多么会祈祷的人！]或[她多虔诚，多热心！]可是，若你对主耶稣有正确的献上，人所注意的是神透过你流露出来的大能。\n[噢，我从神得到一个奇妙的呼召！]其实要在最卑微的生活上荣耀神，正需要那全能的神在我们里面，才可以做得到。惟有圣灵在我们里面，才能使我们完全地属于他，以致全不为人所注意。圣徒生命的考验不在于成功，而是对实际生活的忠心。我们会以在基督教事工上的成功作目标，可是正确的目标，乃是在生活上彰显神的荣耀，在属世的环境下，活出与基督一同藏在神里面的生命。属神的理想生命，是在人与人之间的实际关系上表现出来。\n祈祷◆主啊，在今天的读经中，以下这句话使我的心灵震荡－－[摩西这样行，耶和华怎样吩咐他，他就照样行了。]\n来源： 每日灵粮：《竭诚为主》11月16日 仍然是人\n Brother LL Thoughts\r[2022.11.27]\n中国有一句智慧的话，勿以善小而不为，勿以恶小而为之。\n我常常不在乎对待家人的态度，在言语上表现不恭。养成了下意识的动作。\n\r"},{"id":109,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/021_Ecclesiastes/Ecc_10/","title":"传十章","section":"Ecclesiastes","content":""},{"id":110,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/001_Genesis/Genesis_10/","title":"Genesis 10","section":"Genesis","content":"Genesis\n 10:1 挪亚的儿子闪、含、雅弗的后代、记在下面。 洪水以后、他们都生了儿子。\n10:2 雅弗的儿子是歌篾、玛各、玛代、雅完、土巴、米设、提拉、\n10:3 歌篾的儿子是亚实基拿、利法、陀迦玛。\n10:4 雅完的儿子是以利沙、他施、基提、多单、\n10:5 这些人的后裔、将各国的地土、海岛、分开居住、各随各的方言宗族立国。\n10:6 含的儿子是古实、麦西、弗、迦南、\n10:7 古实的儿子是西巴、哈腓拉、撒弗他、拉玛、撒弗提迦、拉玛的儿子是示巴、底但。\n10:8 古实又生宁录、他为世上英雄之首。1\n10:9 他在耶和华面前是个英勇的猎户、所以俗语说、像宁录在耶和华面前是个英勇的猎户。\n10:10 他国的起头是巴别、以力、亚甲、甲尼、都在示拿地。\n10:11 他从那地出来往亚述去、建造尼尼微、利河伯、迦拉、\n10:12 和尼尼微、迦拉中间的利鲜、这就是那大城。\n10:13 麦西生路低人、亚拿米人、利哈比人、拿弗土希人、 10:14 帕斯鲁细人、迦斯路希人、迦斐托人、从迦斐托出来的有非利士人。\n10:15 迦南生长子西顿、又生赫、\n10:16 和耶布斯人、亚摩利人、革迦撒人、\n10:17 希未人、亚基人、西尼人、\n10:18 亚瓦底人、洗玛利人、哈马人、后来迦南的诸族分散了。\n10:19 迦南的境界是从西顿向基拉耳的路上、直到迦萨、又向所多玛、蛾摩拉、押玛、洗扁的路上、直到拉沙。\n10:20 这就是含的后裔、各随他们的宗族、方言、所住的地土、邦国。\n10:21 雅弗的哥哥闪、是希伯子孙之祖。他也生了儿子。\n10:22 闪的儿子是以拦、亚述、亚法撒、路德、亚兰。\n10:23 亚兰的儿子是乌斯、户勒、基帖、玛施。\n10:24 亚法撒生沙拉、沙拉生希伯、\n10:25 希伯生了两个儿子、一个名叫法勒、〔法勒就是分的意思〕、因为那时人就分地居住。 法勒的兄弟名叫约坍。\n10:26 约坍生亚摩答、沙列、哈萨玛非、耶拉、\n10:27 哈多兰、乌萨、德拉、\n10:28 俄巴路、亚比玛利、示巴、\n10:29 阿斐、哈腓拉、约巴、这都是约坍的儿子。\n10:30 他们所住的地方、是从米沙、直到西发东边的山。\n10:31 这就是闪的子孙、各随他们的宗族、方言、所住的地土、邦国。\n10:32 这些都是挪亚三个儿子的宗族、各随他们的支派立国、洪水以后、他们在地上分为邦国。\n   旷野吗哪 2022年5月5日：宁录\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":111,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/105_Acts/Acts_10/","title":"Acts 10","section":"Acts","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r10:1 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,\n10:2 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.\n10:3 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.\n10:4 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.\n10:5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:\n10:6 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.\n10:7 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;\n10:8 And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.\n10:9 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:\n10:10 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,\n10:11 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:\n10:12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.\n10:13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.\n10:14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.\n10:15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.\n10:16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.\n10:17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon\u0026rsquo;s house, and stood before the gate,\n10:18 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.\n10:19 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.\n10:20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.\n10:21 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?\n10:22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.\n10:23 Then called he them in, and lodged them.

And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.\n10:25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.\n10:26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.\n10:27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.\n10:28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.\n10:29 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?\n10:30 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,\n10:31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.\n10:32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.\n10:33 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.\n10:34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:\n10:35 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.\n10:36 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)\n10:37 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;\n10:38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.\n10:39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:\n10:40 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;\n10:41 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.\n10:42 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.\n10:43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.\n10:44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.\n10:45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.\n10:46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,\n10:47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?\n10:48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.\n\r10:1 在该撒利亚有一个人、名叫哥尼流、是义大利营的百夫长。\n10:2 他是个虔诚人、他和全家都敬畏　神、多多赒济百姓、常常祷告　神。\n10:3 有一天、约在申初、他在异象中、明明看见　神的一个使者进去、到他那里、说、哥尼流。\n10:4 哥尼流定睛看他、惊怕说、主阿、甚么事呢。天使说、你的祷告、和你的赒济、达到　神面前已蒙记念了。\n10:5 现在你当打发人往约帕去、请那称呼彼得的西门来。\n10:6 他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里。房子在海边上。\n10:7 向他说话的天使去后、哥尼流叫了两个家人、和常伺候他的一个虔诚兵来。\n10:8 把这事都述说给他们听、就打发他们往约帕去。\n10:9 第二天、他们行路将近那城、彼得约在午正、上房顶去祷告。\n10:10 觉得饿了、想要吃。那家的人正预备饭的时候、彼得魂游象外。\n10:11 看见天开了、有一物降下、好像一块大布。系着四角、缒在地上。\n10:12 里面有地上各样四足的走兽、和昆虫、并天上的飞鸟。\n10:13 又有声音向他说、彼得、起来、宰了吃。\n10:14 彼得却说、主阿、这是不可的、凡俗物、和不洁净的物、我从来没有吃过。\n10:15 第二次有声音向他说、　神所洁净的、你不可当作俗物。\n10:16 这样一连三次、那物随即收回天上去了。\n10:17 彼得心里正在猜疑之间、不知所看见的异象是甚么意思、哥尼流所差来的人、已经访问到西门的家、站在门外、\n10:18 喊着问、有称呼彼得的西门住在这里没有。\n10:19 彼得还思想那异象的时候、圣灵向他说、有三个人来找你。\n10:20 起来、下去、和他们同往、不要疑惑。因为是我差他们来的。\n10:21 于是彼得下去见那些人、说、我就是你们所找的人。你们来是为甚么缘故。\n10:22 他们说、百夫长哥尼流是个义人、敬畏　神、为犹太通国所称赞、他蒙一位圣天使指示、叫他请你到他家里去、听你的话。\n10:23 彼得就请他们进去、住了一宿。次日起身和他们同去、还有约帕的几个弟兄同着他去。\n10:24 又次日、他们进入该撒利亚。哥尼流已经请了他的亲属密友、等候他们。\n10:25 彼得一进去、哥尼流就迎接他、俯伏在他脚前拜他。\n10:26 彼得却拉他说、你起来。我也是人。\n10:27 彼得和他说着话进去、见有好些人在那里聚集、\n10:28 就对他们说、你们知道犹太人、和别国的人亲近来往、本是不合例的。但　神已经指示我、无论甚么人、都不可看作俗而不洁净的。\n10:29 所以我被请的时候、就不推辞而来。现在请问、你们叫我来有甚么意思呢。\n10:30 哥尼流说、前四天这个时候、我在家中守着申初的祷告、忽然有一个人、穿着光明的衣裳、站在我面前、\n10:31 说、哥尼流、你的祷告、已蒙垂听、你的赒济、达到　神面前已蒙记念了。\n10:32 你当打发人往约帕去、请那称呼彼得的西门来、他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里。\n10:33 所以我立时打发人去请你、你来了很好。现今我们都在　神面前、要听主所吩咐你的一切话。\n10:34 彼得就开口说、我真看出　神是不偏待人。\n10:35 原来各国中、那敬畏主行义的人、都为主所悦纳。\n10:36 神借着耶稣基督（他是万有的主)传和平的福音、将这道赐给以色列人。\n10:37 这话在约翰宣传洗礼以后、从加利利起、传遍了犹太。\n10:38 神怎样以圣灵和能力、膏拿撒勒人耶稣、这都是你们知道的。他周流四方行善事、医好凡被魔鬼压制的人。因为　神与他同在。\n10:39 他在犹太人之地、并耶路撒冷、所行的一切事、有我们作见证。他们竟把他挂在木头上杀了。\n10:40 第三日　神叫他复活、显现出来、\n10:41 不是显现给众人看、乃是显现给　神预先所拣选为他作见证的人看、就是我们这些在他从死里复活以后、和他同吃同喝的人。\n10:42 他吩咐我们传道给众人、证明他是　神所立定的、要作审判活人死人的主。\n10:43 众先知也为他作见证、说、凡信他的人、必因他的名、得蒙赦罪。\n10:44 彼得还说这话的时候、圣灵降在一切听道的人身上。\n10:45 那些奉割礼和彼得同来的信徒、见圣灵的恩赐也浇在外邦人身上、就都希奇。\n10:46 因听见他们说方言、称赞　神为大。\n10:47 于是彼得说、这些人既受了圣灵、与我们一样、谁能禁止用水给他们施洗呢。\n10:48 就吩咐奉耶稣基督的名给他们施洗。他们又请彼得住了几天。\n"},{"id":112,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/103_Luke/Luke_10/","title":"Luke 10","section":"Luke","content":"Book of Luke\n10:1 这事以后、主又设立七十个人、差遣他们两个两个的、在他前面往自己所要到的各城各地方去。\n10:2 就对他们说、要收的庄稼多、作工的人少。所以你们当求庄稼的主、打发工人出去收他的庄稼。\n10:3 你们去吧。我差你们出去、如同羊羔进入狼群。\n10:4 不要带钱囊、不要带口袋、不要带鞋。在路上也不要问人的安。\n10:5 无论进那一家、先要说、愿这一家平安。\n10:6 那里若有当得平安的人、〔当得平安的人原文作平安之子〕你们所求的平安就必临到那家、不然、就归与你们了。\n10:7 你们要住在那家、吃喝他们所供给的。因为工人得工价、是应当的。不要从这家搬到那家。\n10:8 无论进那一城、人若接待你们、给你们摆上甚么、你们就吃甚么。\n10:9 要医治那城里的病人、对他们说、　神的国临近你们了。\n10:10 无论进那一城、人若不接待你们、你们就到街上去、\n10:11 说、就是你们城里的尘土、粘在我们的脚上、我们也当着你们擦去。虽然如此、你们该知道　神的国临近了。\n10:12 我告诉你们、当审判的日子、所多玛所受的、比那城还容易受呢。\n10:13 哥拉汛哪、你有祸了。伯赛大阿、你有祸了。因为在你们中间所行的异能、若行在推罗西顿、他们早已披麻蒙灰坐在地上悔改了。\n10:14 当审判的日子、推罗西顿所受的、比你们还容易受呢。\n10:15 迦百农阿、你已经升到天上。〔或作你将要升到天上么〕将来必推下阴间。\n10:16 又对门徒说、听从你们的、就是听从我、弃绝你们的、就是弃绝我、弃绝我的、就是弃绝那差我来的。\n10:17 那七十个人欢欢喜喜的回来说、主阿、因你的名、就是鬼也服了我们。\n10:18 耶稣对他们说、我曾看见撒但从天上坠落、像闪电一样。\n10:19 我已经给你们权柄、可以践踏蛇和蝎子、又胜过仇敌一切的能力、断没有甚么能害你们。\n10:20 然而不要因鬼服了你们就欢喜。要因你们的名记录在天上欢喜。\n10:21 正当那时、耶稣被圣灵感动就欢乐、说、父阿、天地的主、我感谢你、因为你将这些事、向聪明通达人就藏起来、向婴孩就显出来。父阿、是的、因为你的美意本是如此。\n10:22 一切所有的、都是我父交付我的。除了父、没有人知道子是谁。除了子和子所愿意指示的、没有人知道父是谁。\n10:23 耶稣转身暗暗的对门徒说。看见你们所看见的、那眼睛就有福了。\n10:24 我告诉你们、从前有许多先知和君王、要看你们所看的、却没有看见。要听你们所听的、却没有听见。\n10:25 有一个律法师、起来试探耶稣说、夫子、我该作甚么才可以承受永生。 1\n10:26 耶稣对他说、律法上写的是甚么。你念的是怎样呢。\n10:27 他回答说、『你要尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意、爱主你的　神。又要爱邻舍如同自己。』 10:28 耶稣说、你回答的是。你这样行、就必得永生。\n10:29 那人要显明自己有理、就对耶稣说、谁是我的邻舍呢。\n10:30 耶稣回答说、有一个人从耶路撒冷下耶利哥去、落在强盗手中、他们剥去他的衣裳、把他打个半死、就丢下他走了。\n10:31 偶然有一个祭司、从这条路下来。看见他就从那边过去了。\n10:32 又有一个利未人、来到这地方、看见他、也照样从那边过去了。\n10:33 惟有一个撒玛利亚人、行路来到那里。看见他就动了慈心、 10:34 上前用油和酒倒在他的伤处、包裹好了、扶他骑上自己的牲口、带到店里去照应他。\n10:35 第二天拿出二钱银子来、交给店主说、你且照应他。此外所费用的、我回来必还你。\n10:36 你想这三个人、那一个是落在强盗手中的邻舍呢。\n10:37 他说、是怜悯他的。耶稣说、你去照样行吧。\n10:38 他们走路的时候、耶稣进了一个村庄。有一个女人名叫马大、接他到自己家里。\n10:39 他有一个妹子名叫马利亚、在耶稣脚前坐着听他的道。\n10:40 马大伺候的事多、心里忙乱、就进前来说、主阿、我的妹子留下我一个人伺候、你不在意么。请吩咐他来帮助我。\n10:41 耶稣回答说、马大、马大、你为许多的事、思虑烦扰。\n10:42 但是不可少的只有一件。马利亚已经选择那上好的福分、是不能夺去的。\n  The verse of Luke 10:27 says this: Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself (KJV).\nThe cross-reference of this verse can be found in Mat 22:35-40, Mark 12:28-34, Deut 6:4-5, and Duet 30:1-6. However only this verse links the great commandment in law with the eternal life.\nWhat does \u0026ldquo;everylasting life\u0026rdquo; mean?\nDoes it mean a person who believes in Jesus will go to heaven after death? or something else?\nThe strong number of life in Luke 10:25 is 2222.\nThe strong number 2222 appears in Romans ‬6:4. It says this:\n(KJV) Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\nThis verse tells me three things, 1) it is new; 2) we have this life once we believe in Him; 3) the life we have on earth will not be different from the life we have on the heaven. The transformed life in every believer starts right now, and lasts forever. We can enjoy the sweetness of such life right now, and don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait until we go to the heaven. I could deduct from it that if a person didn\u0026rsquo;t have such life on earth, this person would not be saved, therefore this person would not go to the heaven; and that if a person claimed \u0026ldquo;be saved\u0026rdquo;, the person would show such life right now.\nThe strong number 222 also appears in John 17:3. It says this: ‪(KJV) And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. As brother K pointed it out that having eternal life is to know God in a personal relationship with Him. This is why when God saved us He made us His children, and not His servants. So that we can have a loving relationship with Him. God want a loving relationship with us. This is why He sent His Son to reconcile us to himself. This is why we as Christians are given the ministry of reconciliation (2 Cor 5:18) to mend a broken relationship. In a broken relationship the children of Adam do not know how to love God. This is why the lawyer asked “what must I do” to inherit eternal life. The lawyer’s religion is one of gaining favour with God. Whereas God wants a restored loving relationship.\nJesus is the only way.\n‪Romans‬ 6:22-23 (KJV) says this, 22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.\n23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\nThey tell us Jesus is the way for a non-believer to have the everlasting life. Why did Jesus not point it out to the lawyer that He is the way?\nThe Baptist John described these Pharisees in Mat 3:7 as the generation of viper. These Pharisees got a warning message from the Baptist John about repentance. I assume the lawyer in Luke 10:25 would know of this warning message. When the lawyer met Jesus, he did not take the opportunity of repentance, but \u0026lsquo;tempting\u0026rsquo; Him. Jesus did not repeat the warning message. Did Jesus not give him an opportunity of salvation? I wish the lawyer would get another opportunity.\nThe contrary story is Paul\u0026rsquo;s life. Paul introduced himself in Philippians 3:4-6 (He was a Pharisee, and blamelss in the law). Of course, he knew \u0026ldquo;love the Lord your God with all \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, but \u0026ldquo;persecuted Jesus\u0026rdquo; (Acts 9:4). However when Paul met Jesus in a miracle, he called Him \u0026lsquo;Lord\u0026rsquo;. Jesus selected him even though Paul was one of Pharisees (Acts 9:3).\nMatthew ‬3:7 KJV 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\nPhilippians ‬3:4-6 KJV\n4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:\n5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;\n6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.

But wisdom is justified of her children.\n11:20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:\n11:21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.\n11:22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.\n11:23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.\n11:24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.\n11:25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\n11:26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.\n11:27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.\n11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n11:30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\n\r11:1 耶稣吩咐完了十二个门徒、就离开那里、往各城去传道教训人。\n11:2 约翰在监里听见基督所作的事、就打发两个门徒去、\n11:3 问他说、那将要来的是你么、还是我们等候别人呢。\n11:4 耶稣回答说、你们去把所听见所看见的事告诉约翰。\n11:5 就是瞎子看见、瘸子行走、长大痲疯的洁净、聋子听见、死人复活、穷人有福音传给他们。\n11:6 凡不因我跌倒的、就有福了。\n11:7 他们走的时候、耶稣就对众人讲论约翰说、你们从前出到旷野、是要看甚么呢、要看风吹动的芦苇么。\n11:8 你们出去、到底是要看甚么、要看穿细软衣服的人么、那穿细软衣服的人、是在王宫里。\n11:9 你们出去、究竟是为甚么、是要看先知么。我告诉你们、是的、他比先知大多了。\n11:10 经上记着说、『我要差遣我的使者在你前面、预备道路。』所说的就是这个人。\n11:11 我实在告诉你们、凡妇人所生的、没有一个兴起来大过施洗约翰的。然而天国里最小的、比他还大。\n11:12 从施洗约翰的时候到如今、天国是努力进入的、努力的人就得着了。\n11:13 因为众先知和律法说预言、到约翰为止。\n11:14 你们若肯领受、这人就是那应当来的以利亚。\n11:15 有耳可听的、就应当听。\n11:16 我可用甚么比这世代呢。好像孩童坐在街市上、招呼同伴、说、\n11:17 我们向你们吹笛、你们不跳舞。我们向你们举哀、你们不捶胸。\n11:18 约翰来了、也不吃、也不喝、人就说他是被鬼附着的。\n11:19 人子来了、也吃、也喝、人又说他是贪食好酒的人、是税吏和罪人的朋友。但智慧之子、总以智慧为是。〔有古卷作但智慧在行为上就显为是〕 11:20 耶稣在诸城中行了许多异能、那些城的人终不悔改、就在那时候责备他们说、\n11:21 哥拉汛哪、你有祸了、伯赛大阿、你有祸了、因为在你们中间所行的异能、若行在推罗西顿、他们早已披麻蒙灰悔改了。\n11:22 但我告诉你们、当审判的日子、推罗西顿所受的、比你们还容易受呢。\n11:23 迦百农阿你已经升到天上。〔或作你将要升到天上么〕将来必坠落阴间。因为在你那里所行的异能、若行在所多玛、他还可以存到今日。\n11:24 但我告诉你们、当审判的日子、所多玛所受的、比你还容易受呢。\n11:25 那时、耶稣说、父阿、天地的主、我感谢你、因为你将这些事、向聪明通达人、就藏起来、向婴孩、就显出来。\n11:26 父阿、是的、因为你的美意本是如此。\n11:27 一切所有的、都是我父交付我的。除了父、没有人知道子。除了子和子所愿意指示的、没有人知道父。\n11:28 凡劳苦担重担的人、可以到我这里来、我就使你们得安息。\n11:29 我心里柔和谦卑、你们当负我的轭、学我的样式、这样、你们心里就必得享安息。\n11:30 因为我的轭是容易的、我的担子是轻省的。\n\rBrother WW - fruit of thoughts, 2023-01-15 Sunday\n\"Weary and burdened\" is the actual situation of all people in the world, not only the \"toil\" of life and work, but also the \"burden\" of sin and the \"burden\" of the Pharisees' dogma. To gain the Lord's rest, you must first realize that you are a \"laborer and heavy laden person\", and then \"come\" to the Lord.\r\u0026ldquo;Meekness\u0026rdquo; does not mean weakness, but gentleness due to obedience to God, not insisting on anything or expecting anything for oneself. \u0026ldquo;Humility\u0026rdquo; is not low self-esteem, but not being proud, and completely submitting to God\u0026rsquo;s will. \u0026ldquo;Meekness and lowliness\u0026rdquo; is the reason why the Lord can rest, and it is also the condition for us to rest. This rest is the rest of the \u0026ldquo;heart\u0026rdquo;. Although the external environment may not have changed, the inner one has already enjoyed the rest. A \u0026ldquo;yoke\u0026rdquo; is a wooden crosspiece tied around the necks of a pair of oxen, enabling them to pull loads and plow fields together. \u0026ldquo;Take my yoke\u0026rdquo; refers not to obeying the rules of the law by oneself, but to unite with the Lord, to wear the same yoke, to walk and work together, and to live out the spirit of the law from within.\nThe Lord’s likeness is “resting,” the Lord’s yoke is “easy,” and the Lord’s burden is “light.” If we feel restless, not easy, or light, it is probably not from the Lord. We have not yet fully surrendered within, and we have not yet been yoked together with the Lord, walking together and working together. Jewish farmers often use the method of putting one yoke to a cattle and a calf for training the calf for labor. In this case, the weight is entirely on the cattle, and the calf just walks along side and learns from the cattle. If we are equally yoked with the Lord, the Lord Himself has borne the burden of the yoke, and He will give us sufficient grace so that we will not feel the difficulty of taking the Lord\u0026rsquo;s yoke.\n\r「劳苦担重担」是所有世人的实际情形，不只有生活、工作的「劳苦」，还有罪恶的「重担」、法利赛人教条的「重担」。要得着主的安息，首先必须认识自己是「劳苦担重担的人」，然后「来」到主面前。\r「柔和」不是软弱，而是因顺服神而温柔，不为自己坚持什么、盼望什么。「谦卑」不是自卑，而是不骄傲，完全顺服于神的旨意。「柔和谦卑」是主能安息的理由，也是我们得安息的条件。这个安息是「心里」的安息，虽然外面的环境可能还没改变，但里面却已经得享安息。「轭」是一种木制横档，绑在一对牛的脖子上，使它们能一起拉货、耕地。「当负我的轭」指不是靠自己遵守律法的规条，而是与主联合，同负一轭、同行同工，从生命里面活出律法的精意。\n主的样式是「安息」的，主的轭是「容易」的，主的担子是「轻省」的，如果我们感到不安息、不容易、不轻省，就恐怕不是出乎主的，恐怕我们里面还没有完全降服，还没有与主同负一轭、同行同工。犹太农夫常用大小牛同负一轭的方式，来训练小牛服劳役，在这种情况下，重量全在大牛身上，小牛不过是学大牛的样子，而跟着它走走就是了。我们若与主同负一轭，主自己承当了轭的重负，并且祂还要赐给我们够用的恩典，不叫我们觉得负主轭的艰难。\n\r\r"},{"id":117,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/020_Proverbs/Prov_11/","title":"Proverbs

当审判的时候、南方的女王、要起来定这世代的罪。因为他从地极而来、要听所罗门的智慧话。看哪、在这里有一人比所罗门更大。\n11:32 当审判的时候、尼尼微人要起来定这世代的罪。因为尼尼微人听了约拿所传的、就悔改了。看哪、在这里有一人比约拿更大。\n11:33 没有人点灯放在地窨子里、或是斗底下、总是放在灯台上、使进来的人得见亮光。\n11:34

你们法利赛人有祸了。因为你们喜爱会堂里的首位、又喜爱人在街市上问你们的安。\n11:44 你们有祸了。因为你们如同不显露的坟墓、走在上面的人并不知道。\n11:45 律法师中有一个回答耶稣说、夫子、你这样说、也把我们糟蹋了。\n11:46 耶稣说、你们律法师也有祸了。因为你们把难担的担子、放在人身上、自己一个指头却不肯动。\n11:47 你们有祸了。因为你们修造先知的坟墓、那先知正是你们的祖宗所杀的。\n11:48 可见你们祖宗所作的事、你们又证明又喜欢。因为他们杀了先知、你们修造先知的坟墓。\n11:49 所以　神用智慧曾说、〔用智慧或作的智者〕我要差遣先知和使徒、到他们那里去。有的他们要杀害、有的他们要逼迫。\n11:50 使创世以来、所流众先知血的罪、都要问在这世代的人身上。\n11:51

retiring place of the heart.\nby John Darby Pigrim Portions - Chapter 11\nBrother LL: 我以为祈求就是祷告。原文其实指的是大多数信徒祷告的通病 - 以自我需要为中心的祷告。\nBrother DW: 因为　神不是叫人混乱，乃是叫人安静。(1 Corinthians 14:33 和合本)\n又要立志作安静人，办自己的事，亲手做工，正如我们从前所吩咐你们的， (帖撒罗尼迦前书 4:11 和合本)\n只要以里面存着长久温柔、安静的心为妆饰；这在　神面前是极宝贵的。(彼得前书 3:4 和合本)\n安静这个词在旧约和新约都有，是指内心有平稳still，休息rest，和平peace, 沉静quietness。安静与 和平平安有相似的地方，但两者是不同的字。我有时祷告，满了要说的话，但是安静的时候，才有可能听见主要说的话。我要说话，是交托，是祈求；听主说话，才能明白主心意，才知道如何行。彼前三章4节讲到的是我们的里面人(inner self)要有一个安静的灵(quiet spirit)，并说这在神的面前，是极宝贵的妆饰。\n安静就可以有安稳，可以有很好的休息，可以重新得力。与主同在，其实不用说很多的话，安静的人是祂所喜悦的。感谢主。\nBrother KY: I believe when Darby used the word communion he used it as “the sharing or exchanging of intimate thoughts and feelings, especially when the exchange is on a mental or spiritual level.” I agree with what Darby said. Coming to God and enjoying God’s presence is not the same as coming to Him hurriedly solely for asking him to answer our prayers.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":122,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/105_Acts/Acts_12/","title":"Acts 12","section":"Acts","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r12:1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.\n12:2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.\n12:3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also.

And his chains fell off from his hands.\n12:8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.\n12:9 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.\n12:10 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.\n12:11 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.\n12:12 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.\n12:13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.\n12:14 And when she knew Peter\u0026rsquo;s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.\n12:15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad.

And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.\n12:18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.\n12:19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.\n12:20 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king\u0026rsquo;s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king\u0026rsquo;s country.\n12:21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.\n12:22 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.\n12:23 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.\n12:24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.\n12:25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.\n\r12:1 那时、希律王下手苦害教会中几个人。\n12:2 用刀杀了约翰的哥哥雅各。\n12:3 他见犹太人喜欢这事、又去捉拿彼得。那时正是除酵的日子。\n12:4 希律拿了彼得收在监里、交付四班兵丁看守、每班四个人、意思要在逾越节后、把他提出来、当着百姓办他。\n12:5 于是彼得被囚在监里。教会却为他切切的祷告　神。\n12:6 希律将要提他出来的前一夜、彼得被两条铁链锁着、睡在两个兵丁当中。看守的人也在门外看守。\n12:7 忽然有主的一个使者、站在旁边、屋里有光照耀。天使拍彼得的肋旁、拍醒了他、说、快快起来。那铁链就从他手上脱落下来。\n12:8 天使对他说、束上带子。穿上鞋。他就那样作。天使又说、披上外衣跟着我来。\n12:9 彼得就出来跟着他、不知道天使所作是真的、只当见了异象。\n12:10 过了第一层第二层监牢、就来到临街的铁门。那门自己开了。他们出来、走过一条街、天使便离开他去了。\n12:11 彼得醒悟过来、说、我现在真知道主差遣他的使者、救我脱离希律的手、和犹太百姓一切所盼望的。\n12:12 想了一想、就往那称呼马可的约翰他母亲马利亚家去。在那里有好些人聚集祷告。\n12:13 彼得敲外门、有一个使女、名叫罗大出来探听。\n12:14 听得是彼得的声音、就欢喜的顾不得开门、跑进去告诉众人说、彼得站在门外。\n12:15 他们说、你是疯了。使女极力的说、真是他。他们说、必是他的天使。\n12:16 彼得不住的敲门。他们开了门、看见他、就甚惊奇。\n12:17 彼得摆手、不要他们作声、就告诉他们主怎样领他出监。又说、你们把这事告诉雅各、和众弟兄。于是出去往别处去了。\n12:18 到了天亮、兵丁扰乱得很、不知道彼得往那里去了。\n12:19 希律找他、找不着、就审问看守的人、吩咐把他们拉去杀了。后来希律离开犹太、下该撒利亚去、住在那里。\n12:20 希律恼怒推罗西顿的人。他们那一带地方、是从王的地土得粮、因此就托了王的内侍臣伯拉斯都的情、一心来求和。\n12:21 希律在所定的日子、穿上朝服、坐在位上、对他们讲论一番。\n12:22 百姓喊着说、这是　神的声音、不是人的声音。\n12:23 希律不归荣耀给　神、所以主的使者立刻罚他。他被虫所咬、气就绝了。\n12:24 神的道日见兴旺、越发广传。\n12:25 巴拿巴和扫罗、办完了他们供给的事、就从耶路撒冷回来、带着称呼马可的约翰同去。\n"},{"id":123,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/119_Hebrews/hebrews_12/","title":"Hebrews 12","section":"Hebrews","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r12:1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,\n12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith;

在人面前不认我的、人子在　神的使者面前也必不认他。\n12:10 凡说话干犯人子的、还可得赦免、惟独亵渎圣灵的、总不得赦免。\n12:11 人带你们到会堂、并官府、和有权柄的人面前、不要思虑怎么分诉、说甚么话。\n12:12 因为正在那时候、圣灵要指教你们当说的话。\n12:13 众人中有一个人对耶稣说、夫子、请你吩咐我的兄长和我分开家业。\n12:14 耶稣说、你这个人、谁立我作你们断事的官、给你们分家业呢。\n12:15 于是对众人说、你们要谨慎自守、免去一切的贪心。因为人的生命、不在乎家道丰富。\n12:16 就用比喻对他们说、有一个财主、田产丰盛。\n12:17 自己心里思想说、我的出产没有地方收藏、怎么办呢。\n12:18 又说、我要这么办。要把我的仓房拆了、另盖更大的。在那里好收藏我一切的粮食和财物。\n12:19 然后要对我的灵魂说、灵魂哪、你有许多财物积存、可作多年的费用。只管安安逸逸的吃喝快乐吧。\n12:20 神却对他说、无知的人哪、今夜必要你的灵魂。你所预备的、要归谁呢。\n12:21 凡为自己积财、在　神面前却不富足的、也是这样。\n12:22 耶稣又对门徒说、所以我告诉你们、不要为生命忧虑吃甚么。为身体忧虑穿甚么。\n12:23 因为生命胜于饮食、身体胜于衣裳。\n12:24 你想乌鸦、也不种、也不收。又没有仓、又没有库、　神尚且养活他。你们比飞鸟是何等的贵重呢。\n12:25 你们那一个能用思虑、使寿数多加一刻呢。〔或作使身量多加一肘呢〕\n12:26 这最小的事、你们尚且不能作、为甚么还忧虑其余的事呢。\n12:27 你想百合花、怎么长起来。他也不劳苦、也不纺线。然而我告诉你们、就是所罗门极荣华的时候、他所穿戴的、还不如这花一朵呢。\n12:28 你们这小信的人哪、野地里的草、今天还在、明天就丢在炉里、　神还给他这样的妆饰、何况你们呢。\n12:29 你们不要求吃甚么、喝甚么、也不要挂心。\n12:30 这都是外邦人所求的、你们必须用这些东西、你们的父是知道的。\n12:31 你们只要求他的国、这些东西就必加给你们了。\n12:32 你们这小群、不要惧怕、因为你们的父、乐意把国赐给你们。\n12:33 你们要变卖所有的、赒济人。为自己预备永不坏的钱囊、用不尽的财宝在天上、就是贼不能近、虫不能蛀的地方。\n12:34 因为你们的财宝在那里、你们的心也在那里。\n12:35 你们腰里要束上带、灯也要点着。\n12:36 自己好像仆人等候主人、从婚姻的筵席上回来。他来到叩门、就立刻给他开门。\n12:37 主人来了、看见仆人儆醒、那仆人就有福了。我实在告诉你们、主人必叫他们坐席、自己束上带、进前伺候他们。\n12:38 或是二更天来、或是三更天来、看见仆人这样、那仆人就有福了。\n12:39 家主若知道贼甚么时候来、就必儆醒、不容贼挖透房屋、这是你们所知道的。\n12:40 你们也要预备。因为你们想不到的时候、人子就来了。\n12:41 彼得说、主阿、这比喻是为我们说的呢、还是为众人呢。\n12:42 主说、谁是那忠心有见识的管家、主人派他管理家里的人、按时分粮给他们呢。\n12:43 主人来到、看见仆人这样行、那仆人就有福了。\n12:44 我实在告诉你们、主人要派他管理一切所有的。\n12:45 那仆人若心里说、我的主人必来得迟。就动手打仆人和使女、并且吃喝醉酒。\n12:46 在他想不到的日子、不知道的时辰、那仆人的主人要来、重重的处治他、〔或作把他腰斩了〕定他和不忠心的人同罪。\n12:47 仆人知道主人的意思、却不预备、又不顺他的意思行、那仆人必多受责打。\n12:48 惟有那不知道的、作了当受责打的事、必少受责打。因为多给谁、就向谁多取。多托谁、就向谁多要。1\n12:49 我来要把火丢在地上。倘若已经着起来、不也是我所愿意的么。\n12:50 我有当受的洗。还没有成就、我是何等的迫切呢。\n12:51 你们以为我来、是叫地上太平么。我告诉你们、不是、乃是叫人分争。\n12:52 从今以后、一家五个人将要分争、三个人和两个人相争、两个人和三个人相争。\n12:53 父亲和儿子相争、儿子和父亲相争。母亲和女儿相争、女儿和母亲相争。婆婆和媳妇相争、媳妇和婆婆相争。\n12:54 耶稣又对众人说、你们看见西边起了云彩、就说、要下一阵雨。果然就有。\n12:55 起了南风、就说、将要燥热。也就有了。\n12:56 假冒为善的人哪、你们知道分辨天地的气色。怎么不知道分辨这时候呢。\n12:57 你们又为何不自己审量、甚么是合理的呢。\n12:58 你同告你的对头去见官、还在路上、务要尽力的和他了结。恐怕他拉你到官面前、官交付差役、差役把你下在监里。\n12:59 我告诉你、若有半文钱没有还清、你断不能从那里出来。\n  问题：恶仆能进天国吗？\n2022.08.03 在Kevin Yip家中周三查经聚会中我们查到35-48节，关于仆人的比喻。\nKevin引用了林前3:10-15，并且用了勉强得救一说 (English: be saved by the skin of the (your)

And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.\n13:12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.\n13:13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.\n13:14 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.\n13:15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.\n13:16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.\n13:17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.\n13:18 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.\n13:19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.\n13:20 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.\n13:21 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.\n13:22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill all my will. v22: a man after mine own heart: understand the cross and the blood; God\u0026rsquo;s will: salvation, regeneration/ transformation\n13:23 Of this man\u0026rsquo;s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:\n13:24 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.\n13:25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am?

that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.\n13:34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.\n13:35 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.\n13:36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:\n13:37 But he, whom God raised again, saw no

perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.\n13:42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.\n13:43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.\n13:44 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.\n13:45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.\n13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.\n13:47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.\n13:48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.\n13:49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.\n13:50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.\n13:51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.\n13:52 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.\n\r13:1 在安提阿的教会中、有几位先知和教师、就是巴拿巴、和称呼尼结的西面、古利奈人路求、与分封之王希律同养的马念、并扫罗。\n13:2 他们事奉主、禁食的时候、圣灵说、要为我分派巴拿巴和扫罗、去作我召他们所作的工。\n13:3 于是禁食祷告、按手在他们头上、就打发他们去了。\n13:4 他们既被圣灵差遣、就下到西流基、从那里坐船往居比路去。\n13:5 到了撒拉米、就在犹太人各会堂里传讲　神的道。也有约翰作他们的帮手。\n13:6 经过全岛、直到帕弗、在那里遇见一个有法术假充先知的犹太人、名叫巴耶稣。\n13:7 这人常和方伯士求保罗同在、士求保罗是个通达人。他请了巴拿巴和扫罗来、要听　神的道。\n13:8

保罗和他的同人、从帕弗开船、来到旁非利亚的别加。约翰就离开他们回耶路撒冷去。\n13:14 他们离了别加往前行、来到彼西底的安提阿。在安息日进会堂坐下。\n13:15 读完了律法和先知的书、管会堂的叫人过去、对他们说、二位兄台、若有甚么劝勉众人的话、请说。\n13:16 保罗就站起来、举手说、以色列人、和一切敬畏　神的人、请听。\n13:17 这以色列民的　神、拣选了我们的祖宗、当民寄居埃及的时候、抬举他们、用大能的手领他们出来。\n13:18 又在旷野容忍他们约有四十年。〔容忍或作抚养〕 13:19 既灭了迦南地七族的人、就把那地分给他们为业。\n13:20 此后、给他们设立士师、约有四百五十年、直到先知撒母耳的时候。\n13:21 后来他们求一个王、　神就将便雅悯支派中、基士的儿子扫罗、给他们作王四十年。\n13:22 既废了扫罗、就选立大卫作他们的王。又为他作见证说、『我寻得耶西的儿子大卫、他是合我心意的人、凡事要遵行我的旨意。』\n13:23 从这人的后裔中、　神已经照着所应许的、为以色列人立了一位救主、就是耶稣。\n13:24 在他没有出来以先、约翰向以色列众民宣讲悔改的洗礼。\n13:25

虽然查不出他有当死的罪来、还是求彼拉多杀他。\n13:29 既成就了经上指着他所记的一切话、就把他从木头上取下来、放在坟墓里。\n13:30 神却叫他从死里复活。\n13:31 那从加利利同他上耶路撒冷的人多日看见他、这些人如今在民间是他的见证。\n13:32 我们也报好信息给你们、就是那应许祖宗的话、\n13:33 神已经向我们这作儿女的应验、叫耶稣复活了。正如诗篇第二篇上记着说、『你是我的儿子、我今日生你。』\n13:34 论到　神叫他从死里复活、不再归于朽坏、就这样说、『我必将所应许大卫那圣洁可靠的恩典、赐给你们。』\n13:35 又有一篇上说、『你必不叫你的圣者见朽坏。』\n13:36 大卫在世的时候、遵行了　神的旨意、就睡了、〔或作大卫按　神的旨意服事了他那一世的人就睡了〕归到他祖宗那里、已见朽坏。\n13:37 惟独　神所复活的、他并未见朽坏。\n13:38 所以弟兄们、你们当晓得、赦罪的道是由这人传给你们的。\n13:39 你们靠摩西的律法、在一切不得称义的事上、信靠这人、就都得称义了。\n13:40 所以你们务要小心、免得先知书上所说的临到你们。\n13:41 主说、『你们这轻慢的人要观看、要惊奇、要灭亡。因为在你们的时候、我行一件事、虽有人告诉你们、你们总是不信。』\n13:42 他们出会堂的时候、众人请他们到下安息日、再讲这话给他们听。\n13:43 散会以后、犹太人和敬虔进犹太教的人、多有跟从保罗、巴拿巴的、二人对他们讲道、劝他们务要恒久在　神的恩中。\n13:44 到下安息日、合城的人、几乎都来聚集、要听　神的道。\n13:45 但犹太人看见人这样多、就满心嫉妒、硬驳保罗所说的话、并且毁谤。\n13:46 保罗和巴拿巴放胆说、　神的道先讲给你们、原是应当的、只因你们弃绝这道、断定自己不配得永生、我们就转向外邦人去。\n13:47 因为主曾这样吩咐我们说、『我已经立你作外邦人的光、叫你施行救恩直到地极。』\n13:48 外邦人听见这话、就欢喜了、赞美　神的道。凡预定得永生的人都信了。\n13:49 于是主的道、传遍了那一带地方。\n13:50 但犹太人挑唆虔敬尊贵的妇女、和城内有名望的人、逼迫保罗、巴拿巴、将他们赶出境外。\n13:51 二人对着众人跺下脚上的尘土、就往以哥念去了。\n13:52 门徒满心喜乐、又被圣灵充满。\n\r2022年12月2日\n活泉小简\n神确定的法则\n[..·我寻得耶西的儿子大卫，他是合我心意的人，凡事要遵行我的旨意。] (徒十三 22)\n神要建造以色列人成为一个国度，这是神为着袖子民的旨意。神的旨意并不是要让他的子民们四散、分开或是软弱，神的旨意乃是要池的子民们被结合而刚强。但是在神实现他的旨意和目的之前，首先要寻找一个合适的器皿换句话说，神关心人更重过工作。神是有一个工作要做，但如果袖不能找到那对的人，他会等待直到他得着了对的人，才开始那对的工作这乃是神确定的法则。\n摘自《神说话了》(江守道)\n Brother L: “合神心意”的教会牧者或者长老会是谁？\n在我看来，神的旨意不单单是说：“并不是要让他的子民们四散、分开或是软弱，神的旨意乃是要池的子民们被结合而刚强。”在属灵的层面上讲，应该是：上帝愿人人都得救，人人的生命都被改造、被建造。\u0026ldquo;yet not I but through Christ in me.\u0026rdquo;\n如果我们不持守简单的福音，转而去借助世人的方式使信徒得到心灵的满足，生命反而原地踏步，我们就不是“合神心意”的教会牧者或者长老。\nBrother D: 教會裡有小子，有少年人，有父老。做長老的，一般比小子和少年人更成熟，認識經歷神更深一些，體力方面又比父老更健壯。所以被託付來照管教會，照顧群羊。\nSister G:

will in future\nIn what ways was Moses like Jesus?\rIn one of Moses’ final speeches, he gave this messianic prophecy: “The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him” (Deuteronomy 18:15). The prophet whom Moses foretells bears these qualities: He will be raised up by God, He will come from among the Israelites, He will be like Moses, and He will be worthy of being heard and obeyed. The prophet who fulfills these words is Jesus Christ, the prophet like Moses.\rOn the banks of the Jordan River, the Jews questioned John the Baptist about who he was and why he was baptizing. Their question “Are you the Prophet?” (John 1:21) shows that they were looking for the fulfillment of Moses’ prophecy. John plainly informed them that he was not the Prophet but pointed them to the One who was: “Among you stands one you do not know. He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie” (verses 26–27). John’s description of the Messiah as one “among you” recalls Moses’ prediction that God would raise up the Prophet “from among you” in Deuteronomy 18:15. The very next day, John specifically identifies Jesus as the One they were waiting for (John 1:29–31).\nIn his sermon at the temple, Peter affirms that Jesus is the prophet like Moses (Acts 3:22, quoting Deuteronomy 18:15). Stephen, addressing the Sanhedrin in Acts 7:37, also quotes Moses and applies the prophecy to Jesus Christ.\nJesus is like Moses in several ways. Moses was both a prophet and a lawgiver, and Jesus is, too. Jesus was widely recognized as a prophet who spoke the Word of God (Matthew 21:46), and He gave commandments for His followers to obey (John 13:34; 15:12, 17; Galatians 6:2). Both Moses and Jesus mediated a covenant between God and men—Moses the Old Covenant (Exodus 34:27; Acts 7:44), and Jesus the New (Luke 22:20; Hebrews 9:15). Both Moses and Jesus were born during perilous times, and both narrowly escaped a king bent on murdering babies (Exodus 1:22 and Matthew 2:16–18). Both Moses and Jesus had a connection to Egypt (Exodus 2:1–4 and Matthew 2:13–14). Moses was the (adopted) son of a king (Exodus 2:10), and Jesus is the Son of the Most High (Luke 1:32). Moses spent forty years as a shepherd (Exodus 3:1), and Jesus is the Good Shepherd (John 10:11, 14). Both Moses and Jesus were known for their meekness (Numbers 12:3 and Matthew 11:29).\nMoses and Jesus were alike in that they both led God’s people out of captivity. With great power, Moses led the Israelites out of physical bondage and slavery in Egypt, and Jesus, with even greater power, led God’s elect out of spiritual bondage and slavery to sin. Moses stood before Pharaoh and said, “\u0026lsquo;Let my people go” (Exodus 5:1). Jesus came “to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and . . . to set the oppressed free” (Luke 4:18). “In Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life has set you free from the law of sin and death” (Romans 8:2).\nMoses was also like Jesus in that he performed miracles—not all prophets did. Several of the miracles of Moses bear a resemblance to Jesus’ miracles, most notably the provision of bread in the wilderness (Exodus 16:35), which is comparable to Jesus’ feeding of the 5,000 (John 6:1–13). In fact, after Jesus multiplied the loaves and fishes, the people’s thoughts ran immediately to Moses’ prophecy: “After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, ‘Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world’” (John 6:14).\nAnother way that Moses was like Jesus is that he held intimate conversations with God: “The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend” (Exodus 33:11). Jesus also had a special relationship to God: “No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son” (Matthew 11:27); “The Father knows me and I know the Father” (John 10:15). When Moses stood in God’s presence, his face shone with a heavenly glory and had to be covered with a veil (Exodus 34:29–35), and this reminds us of Jesus’ transfiguration, when “His face shone like the sun” (Matthew 17:2).\nAnother important way that Moses was like Jesus is that he constantly interceded for his people. When the Israelites sinned, Moses was always standing by, ready to petition God on their behalf and plead for their forgiveness. After the blatant idolatry at the foot of Mt. Sinai involving the golden calf, Moses interceded twice for the people (Exodus 32:11–13, 30–32), and his intercession was needed at other times, too (e.g., Numbers 11:2; 12:13; 21:7). Moses’ intercession was temporary, but our Lord’s is everlasting. “If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One” (1 John 2:1). Jesus is right now “at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us” (Romans 8:34). Jesus “always lives to intercede” for us (Hebrews 7:25).\nNot only was Moses an intercessor for God’s people but, like Jesus, he was willing to die for them. In Exodus 32:32, Moses offers his life in exchange for sinners. “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends,” Jesus said (John 15:13), and Jesus proved His love when He “laid down his life for us” (1 John 3:16; cf. John 10:15).\nReference: Got Questions | In what ways was Moses like Jesus?\nComparison\rCould we see Jesus in Moses?\rperformed miracles Moses was a prophet, priest\n\rBible verses on Moses\r\r\r\rComparison\n\rMoses\n\rJesus\n\r\r\r\r\r\rGod's plan\r\r\ryes, Moses was the role in God's plan.

Arise, let us go hence.\n\rGiving the Gospel by Joni Eareckson Tada\nSEPTEMBER 21ST, 2022 | 04:00 | E92122\n\r Hi, this is Joni Eareckson Tada with a word about healing.\nBecause often I meet people who ask, “Joni, don’t you want to get healed?” Well, duh—I wouldn’t be human if I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get healed. And, in fact, there was a season in my life when I begged God to heal me. I would say for the first, oh, five to ten years in my wheelchair, it was the major deal in all my prayers, and when it appeared that I would never walk again, I still kept praying for healing; I at least wanted my hands to get healed. And one of the key verses I used in my prayers was John 14:13-14 where Jesus says, \u0026ldquo;I will do whatever you ask in my name so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.\u0026rdquo; Well, that was quite a promise! Jesus will give us whatever we ask, as long as we ask in his name?!\nWell, I kept doing just that—asking in his name, but nothing happened, so I dug deeper, confessing, repenting of whatever extra sin might stand in the way. But still, my feet and my hands did not respond. I wondered what I was doing wrong. I don’t know, maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve experienced that same thing with that verse. You\u0026rsquo;ve asked for something important—like healing or whatever—you ask it in Jesus’ name, and you ask it, that it might bring glory to God, but still, all you get is silence or perhaps the reply from God is, \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; “But Jesus,” you think, “you said you would do whatever I ask in your name. What gives?!”\nSo I went back to John 14, and this time I read all the way around it. I discovered that the context is all about \u0026ldquo;giving the Gospel.\u0026rdquo; After all, this chapter was our Savior\u0026rsquo;s last chance to teach his disciples about the main thing. And the main thing, we\u0026rsquo;d all agree, is his Gospel. Jesus was so passionate about his disciples giving the Good News, that he inasmuch said, “Look, if there are mountains in your way, I’ll move them. If there’s an obstacle in your path, I’ll help you get rid of it. If it means advancing the kingdom of God, I’ll do it.” Jesus was adamant about this because this is what would give his Father the most glory.\n\rOnce this fact sank in, it made my wheelchair seem insignificant in comparison. My problems didn’t seem so important. What’s more, I began to grasp the fact that my paralysis was part of God\u0026rsquo;s strategy to further his Gospel. After all, it says in 1 Peter 2:21-22, \u0026ldquo;To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps.\u0026rdquo; Just as Christ suffered yet trusted the Father, I am to follow in his steps on the road marked with suffering and trust my heavenly Father, even with quadriplegia.\nAnd it’s a lesson for you. When we Christians trust the Lord in our hardships, it showcases to a skeptical, cynical, and unbelieving world that God is worth trusting and the Bible is worth believing. The world cannot argue when it sees people in pain rejoice in their God. Friend, no one goes to Christ’s heaven who does not first share in Christ’s sufferings. And there’s a good reason for it. Heaven is going to be populated with people who opened their eyes to God because they saw the power and the reality of his Gospel demonstrated through you. And that’s worth being healed on your feet any day.\nI\u0026rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts on this important topic of healing. Just go to my radio page at joniradio.org. And, hey, if you have experienced an extraordinary physical healing, I rejoice with you! Just remember to make that part of your testimony, because the important thing is not primarily your healing, but that it is used to advance the Gospel of Christ. Let’s keep the main thing the main thing!\n© Joni and Friends\n my thoughts It is not only healing, but also other things that bother us, or things that we are so eager to get it, that we pray to God. There are other prayers in Bible seeming that God will answer our prayers, such as Jeremiah 33:3. However, God wants us to put Him at the first priority, put His will at the first priority, just as Matthew 6:31-33. God knows our need because of His love, grace, and mercy, He will provide them at the right timing. Interestingly Joni saw her accident as a part of God\u0026rsquo;s strategy to further His gospel. Do I see myself as a part of God\u0026rsquo;s strategy to preach gospel once I join in His family? Do I preach the gospel while I am looking for a job? Do I preach the gospel to the family members while I stay at home? To go beyond that, I ask myself, am I the walking gospel?\nThen I go over this question again: What is the gospel?\n First of all, it is the good news of Jesus' coming down and saving us from sin, so that we can be free from dying in the sin; Secondly, it is about the power of transformation. The gospel can change me. If I still prayed for the benefit for myself, and there was no change in me, the gospel would not be a good news.

And he came out the same hour.\n16:19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,\n16:20 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,\n16:21 And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.\n16:22 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.\n16:23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:\n16:24 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.\n16:25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.\n16:26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one\u0026rsquo;s bands were loosed.\n16:27 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.\n16:28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.\n16:29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,\n16:30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\n16:31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\n16:32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.\n16:33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.\n16:34 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.\n16:35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.\n16:36 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.\n16:37 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.\n16:38 And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.\n16:39 And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.\n16:40 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.\n\r16:1 保罗来到特庇、又到路司得。在那里有一个门徒、名叫提摩太、是信主之犹太妇人的儿子、他父亲却是希利尼人。\n16:2 路司得和以哥念的弟兄、都称赞他。\n16:3 保罗要带他同去、只因那些地方的犹太人、都知道他父亲是希利尼人、就给他行了割礼。\n16:4 他们经过各城、把耶路撒冷使徒和长老所定的条规、交给门徒遵守。\n16:5 于是众教会信心越发坚固、人数天天加增。\n16:6 圣灵既然禁止他们在亚西亚讲道、他们就经过弗吕家加拉太一带地方。\n16:7 到了每西亚的边界、他们想要往庇推尼去、耶稣的灵却不许。\n16:8 他们就越过每西亚、下到特罗亚去。\n16:9 在夜间有异象现与保罗。有一个马其顿人、站着求他说、请你过到马其顿来帮助我们。\n16:10 保罗既看见这异象、我们随即想要往马其顿去、以为　神召我们传福音给那里的人听。\n16:11 于是从特罗亚开船、一直行到撒摩特喇、第二天到了尼亚波利。\n16:12 从那里来到腓立比、就是马其顿这一方的头一个城。也是罗马的驻防城。我们在这城里住了几天。\n16:13 当安息日、我们出城门、到了河边、知道那里有一个祷告的地方、我们就坐下对那聚会的妇女讲道。\n16:14 有一个卖紫色布匹的妇人、名叫吕底亚、是推雅推喇城的人、素来敬拜　神。他听见了、主就开导他的心、叫他留心听保罗所讲的话。\n16:15 他和他一家既领了洗、便求我们说、你们若以为我是真信主的、〔或作你们若以为我是忠心事主的〕请到我家里来住。于是强留我们。\n16:16 后来、我们往那祷告的地方去。有一个使女迎着面来、他被巫鬼所附、用法术、叫他主人们大得财利。\n16:17 他跟随保罗和我们、喊着说、这些人是至高　神的仆人、对你们传说救人的道。\n16:18 他一连多日这样喊叫、保罗就心中厌烦、转身对那鬼说、我奉耶稣基督的名、吩咐你从他身上出来。那鬼当时就出来了。\n16:19 使女的主人们、见得利的指望没有了、便揪住保罗和西拉、拉他们到市上去见首领。\n16:20 又带到官长面前说、这些人原是犹太人、竟骚扰我们的城、\n16:21 传我们罗马人所不可受、不可行的规矩。\n16:22 众人就一同起来攻击他们。官长吩咐剥了他们的衣裳、用棍打。\n16:23 打了许多棍、便将他们下在监里、嘱咐禁卒严紧看守。\n16:24 禁卒领了这样的命、就把他们下在内监里、两脚上了木狗。\n16:25 约在半夜、保罗和西拉、祷告唱诗赞美　神。众囚犯也侧耳而听。\n16:26 忽然地大震动、甚至监牢的地基都摇动了。监门立刻全开、众囚犯的锁链也都松开了。\n16:27 禁卒一醒、看见监门全开、以为囚犯已经逃走、就拔刀要自杀。\n16:28 保罗大声呼叫说、不要伤害自己、我们都在这里。\n16:29 禁卒叫人拿灯来、就跳进去、战战兢兢的、俯伏在保罗西拉面前。\n16:30 又领他们出来、说、二位先生、我当怎样行才可以得救。\n16:31 他们说、当信主耶稣、你和你一家都必得救。\n16:32 他们就把主的道、讲给他和他全家的人听。\n16:33 当夜、就在那时候、禁卒把他们带去、洗他们的伤。他和属乎他的人、立时都受了洗。\n16:34 于是禁卒领他们上自己家里去、给他们摆上饭、他和全家、因为信了　神、都很喜乐。\n16:35 到了天亮、官长打发差役来说、释放那两个人吧。\n16:36 禁卒就把这话告诉保罗说、官长打发人来叫释放你们。如今可以出监、平平安安的去吧。\n16:37 保罗却说、我们是罗马人、并没有定罪、他们就在众人面前打了我们、又把我们下在监里。现在要私下撵我们出去么、这是不行的。叫他们自己来领我们出去吧。\n16:38 差役把这话回禀官长。官长听见他们是罗马人、就害怕了。\n16:39 于是来劝他们、领他们出来、请他们离开那城。\n16:40 二人出了监、往吕底亚家里去。见了弟兄们、劝慰他们一番、就走了。\n"},{"id":143,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/106_Romans/Romans_16/","title":"Romans 16","section":"Romans","content":" KJV\rverse 12\r\r16:1 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:\n16:2 That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.\n16:3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:\n16:4 Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.\n16:5 Likewise greet the church that is in their house.

There is nothing about them that needs the death of Jesus Christ. All that is required is a pious atmosphere, prayer, and devotion. This type of experience is not supernatural nor miraculous. It did not cost the sufferings of God, nor is it stained with “the blood of the Lamb” (Revelation 12:11). It is not marked or sealed by the Holy Spirit as being genuine, and it has no visual sign that causes people to exclaim with awe and wonder, “That is the work of God Almighty!” Yet the New Testament is about the work of God and nothing else.\nThe New Testament example of the Christian experience is that of a personal, passionate devotion to the Person of Jesus Christ. Every other kind of so-called Christian experience is detached from the Person of Jesus. There is no regeneration— no being born again into the kingdom in which Christ lives and reigns supreme. There is only the idea that He is our pattern. In the New Testament Jesus Christ is the Savior long before He is the pattern. Today He is being portrayed as the figurehead of a religion — a mere example. He is that, but He is infinitely more. He is salvation itself; He is the gospel of God!\nJesus said, “…when He, the Spirit of truth, has come,…He will glorify Me…” (John 16:13-14). When I commit myself to the revealed truth of the New Testament, I receive from God the gift of the Holy Spirit, who then begins interpreting to me what Jesus did. The Spirit of God does in me internally all that Jesus Christ did for me externally.\nWISDOM FROM OSWALD CHAMBERS\nThe main characteristic which is the proof of the indwelling Spirit is an amazing tenderness in personal dealing, and a blazing truthfulness with regard to God’s Word.

The text can be broken down into two parts: the parable (verses 1–8) and the application (verses 9–13). Luke 16:1 identifies that Jesus is speaking to His disciples, but there is a suggestion that His audience is mixed—disciples and Pharisees. Luke 16:14 states that the Pharisees “heard all these things and ridiculed [Jesus].” We also see in verse 1 that Jesus “also” said to the disciples; the “also” would suggest that this parable is connected to the previous three in Luke 15 and that the audience was a mixed crowd of disciples and Pharisees.\nIt is important to know to whom Jesus is addressing this parable. The parable is for the benefit of the disciples, but there is also a not-so-subtle critique of the Pharisees, as was evident in Luke 15. Verse 14 is Luke’s commentary on the motivation of the Pharisees, and in verse 15 we see our Lord condemn their motives. And what was the Pharisees’ motivation? They were those who were “lovers of money” and who “justify themselves before men” and who exalted that which was an “abomination before God.”\nWith that as a backdrop, let’s look at the parable. It’s a fairly simple, if somewhat unorthodox, parable from Jesus. The story is simple, but the setting is unusual. In most of Jesus’ parables, the protagonist is either representative of God, Christ, or some other positive character. In this parable the characters are all wicked—the steward and the man whose possessions he manages are both unsavory characters. This should alert us to the fact that Jesus is not exhorting us to emulate the behavior of the characters but is trying to expound on a larger principle.\nThe parable begins with a rich man calling his steward before him to inform him that he will be relieving him of his duties for mismanaging his master’s resources. A steward is a person who manages the resources of another. The steward had authority over all of the master’s resources and could transact business in his name. This requires the utmost level of trust in the steward. Now, it may not be apparent at this point in the parable (but is made more evident later on), but the master is probably not aware of the steward’s dishonesty. The steward is being released for apparent mismanagement, not fraud. This explains why he is able to conduct a few more transactions before he is released and why he is not immediately tossed out on the street or executed.\nThe steward, realizing that he will soon be without a job, makes some shrewd deals behind his master’s back by reducing the debt owed by several of the master’s debtors in exchange for shelter when he is eventually put out. When the master becomes aware of what the wicked servant had done, he commends him for his “shrewdness.”\nIn His application of the story in the remaining verses, Jesus begins by saying, “For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light” (Luke 16:8). Jesus is drawing a contrast between the “sons of the world” (i.e., unbelievers) and the “sons of light” (believers). Unbelievers are wiser in the things of this world than believers are about the things of the world to come. The unjust steward, once he knew he was about to be put out, maneuvered to collect some quick cash, cheat his master (who more than likely was cheating his customers), and make friends of his master’s debtors—who would then be obligated to care for him once he lost his job.\nWhat does this have to do with believers being wise about the life to come? Let’s look at verse 9: “And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.” Jesus is encouraging His followers to be generous with their wealth in this life so that in the life to come their new friends will receive them “into eternal dwellings.” This is similar to Jesus’ teaching on wealth in the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus exhorts His followers to lay up treasures in heaven (Matthew 6:19–21).\nThe term unrighteous (or worldly) wealth seems to strike readers the wrong way. But Jesus is not saying that believers should gain wealth unrighteously and then be generous with it. “Unrighteous” in reference to wealth can refer to 1) the means in acquiring wealth; 2) the way in which one desires to use the wealth; or 3) the corrupting influence wealth can have that often leads people to commit unrighteous acts. Given the way in which Jesus employs the term, the third explanation seems the most likely. Wealth is not inherently evil, but the love of money can lead to all sorts of sin (1 Timothy 6:10).\nSo, the principle that Jesus is trying to convey is one of a just steward rather than an unjust one. The unjust steward saw his master’s resources as a means for his own personal enjoyment and advancement. Conversely, Jesus wants His followers to be just, righteous stewards. If we understand the principle that everything we own is a gift from God, then we realize that God is the owner of everything and that we are His stewards. As such, we are to use the Master’s resources to further the Master’s goals. In this specific case, we are to be generous with our wealth and use it for the benefit of others.\nJesus then goes on to expand in verses 10–13 the principle given in verse 9. If one is faithful in “little” (i.e., “unrighteous” wealth), then one will be faithful in much. Similarly, if one is dishonest in little, he will also be dishonest in much. If we can’t be faithful with earthly wealth, which isn’t even ours to begin with, then how can we be entrusted with “true riches”? The “true riches” here is referring to stewardship and responsibility in God’s kingdom along with all the accompanying heavenly rewards.\nThe climax of Jesus’ application is verse 13: “No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money” (see also Matthew 6:24). If God is our Master, then our wealth will be at His disposal. In other words, the faithful and just steward whose Master is God will employ that wealth in building up the kingdom of God.\n Reference: What is the meaning of the Parable of the Unjust Steward (Luke 16:1-13)?\n \r\rezraLinkifier.setLang('zh-Hans');\rezraLinkifier.linkify(document.body);\r"},{"id":146,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/009_1_Samuel/1Samuel_16/","title":"1 Samuel 16","section":"1 Samuel","content":"KJV\r和合本\rVerse 1-5\r\r\r\rDoes God Use Deception?\n"},{"id":147,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/019_Psalms/Psalm_016/","title":"Psalm 16","section":"Psalms","content":"Psalms\n 16:1 〔大卫的金诗。〕　神阿、求你保佑我、因为我投靠你。\n16:2 我的心哪、你曾对耶和华说、你是我的主。 我的好处不在你以外。\n16:3 论到世上的圣民、他们又美又善、是我最喜悦的。\n16:4 以别神代替耶和华的、〔或作送礼物给别神的〕他们的愁苦必加增。 他们所浇奠的血我不献上、我嘴唇也不提别神的名号。\n16:5 耶和华是我的产业、是我杯中的分。我所得的你为我持守。\n16:6 用绳量给我的地界、坐落在佳美之处。我的产业实在美好。\n16:7 我必称颂那指教我的耶和华。我的心肠在夜间也警戒我。\n16:8 我将耶和华常摆在我面前。因他在我右边、我便不至摇动。1\n16:9 因此我的心欢喜、我的灵〔原文作荣耀〕快乐。我的肉身也要安然居住。\n16:10 因为你必不将我的灵魂撇在阴间。也不叫你的圣者见朽坏。\n16:11 你必将生命的道路指示我。在你面前有满足的喜乐。在你右手中有永远的福乐。\n  基督徒的生活方式就是在“与主的相交中”度过每一天。大卫说，他将耶和华常摆在他面前。神不是“只”在大卫的理念中，而是在与神个别的相交互动中，大卫不断的认识祂。\n主是活着的，每一天，我们对祂有没有奔放的热情，属灵的期待，喜乐和盼望呢？\n凡是像大卫这样，以神为乐，活在神的喜悦中的人，都可以一无挂虑，因为其他的一切都会跟着来。\n很多人会对“不可知的将来”感到害怕，甚至心存悲观。但只要主是我的牧者，不明朗的环境就是我的朋友。因为必然是“在神手中，为神所用。”葛培理牧师在自己的自传里提到，当他第一次去非洲伊索匹亚布道的时候，遇到很大的难题。当时伊索匹亚两千万人是由海尔‧塞西拉皇帝所统治。这位皇帝要过问伊索匹亚人民生活的每一个细节，什么事都要管。所以想要在当地开布道会，必须先经过他同意。\n布道团为此一筹莫展，两位同工来到当地，没有任何管道。当地的宣教士灰心绝望的告诉他们，“此路不通，除非有奇迹发生。”两位同工离去前，和大家一起祷告的时候，突然一位伊索匹亚的牧师提高嗓音，引述旧约以斯帖记里的一段经文。这位牧师想起神怎样在半夜里唤醒了亚哈随鲁王，促使他采取一连串的行动，终于拯救了犹大民族免于灭绝。牧师就祷告说，“神啊，你既然能在半夜唤醒波斯王，你一定也能将这一次邀请人来布道的消息通报给国王。”\n隔天两位同工收拾好行李，跟柜台结完了帐就准备离开旅馆，这时一位来自北欧的男士刚好走进来，他认识其中一位同工。那人名叫托瑞，是挪威负责筹备布道会的委员之一。两位同工把所遇到的难题一五一十告诉他。托瑞听了以后说，“好的，焉知我来伊索匹亚，不就是为了现今的机会吗？”原来他跟伊索匹亚有商业上的往来，那一天刚好要和皇太子共进午餐。就这样，三天之后，两位同工在埃及收到一封电报，上头告知海尔‧塞西拉皇帝不仅批准这次布道会，而且特许葛培理布道团使用皇家体育场。不但如此，皇帝还下令所有的学校都停课，让青年们都去参加这次布道大会。结果那次布道会是葛培理牧师在非洲布道决志人数最多的一次。\n本来看起来根本不可能的事情，因为有神在其中巧妙安排、引导，却看见了意想不到的最好的结果。\n旷野吗哪 2022年4月27日：祂在你的右边\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":148,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/002_Exodus/Exodus_17/","title":"Exodus 17","section":"Exodus","content":"KJV\r和合本\r\r17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.\n17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink.

And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.\n20:17 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?\n20:18 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\n20:19 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.\n20:20 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.\n20:21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:\n20:22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?\n20:23 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?\n20:24 Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar\u0026rsquo;s.\n20:25 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar\u0026rsquo;s, and unto God the things which be God\u0026rsquo;s.\n20:26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.\n20:27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,\n20:28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man\u0026rsquo;s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.\n20:29 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.\n20:30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.\n20:31 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.\n20:32 Last of all the woman died also.\n20:33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.\n20:34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:\n20:35 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:\n20:36 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.\n20:37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\n20:38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.\n20:39 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.\n20:40 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.\n20:41 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David\u0026rsquo;s son?\n20:42 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,\n20:43 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.\n20:44 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?\n20:45 Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,\n20:46 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;\n20:47 Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.\n\r20:1 有一天耶稣在殿里教训百姓、讲福音的时候、祭司长和文士并长老上前来、\n20:2 问他说、你告诉我们、你仗着甚么权柄作这些事、给你这权柄的是谁呢。\n20:3 耶稣回答说、我也要问你们一句话。你们且告诉我。\n20:4 约翰的洗礼、是从天上来的、是从人间来的呢。\n20:5 他们彼此商议说、我们若说从天上来、他必说你们为甚么不信他呢。\n20:6 若说从人间来、百姓都要用石头打死我们。因为他们信约翰是先知。\n20:7 于是回答说、不知道是从那里来的。\n20:8 耶稣说、我也不告诉你们、我仗着甚么权柄作这些事。\n20:9 耶稣就设比喻、对百姓说、有人栽了一个葡萄园、租给园户、就往外国去住了许久。\n20:10 到了时候、打发一个仆人到园户那里去、叫他们把园中当纳的果子交给他。园户竟打了他、叫他空手回去。\n20:11 又打发一个仆人去。他们也打了他、并且凌辱他、叫他空手回去。\n20:12 又打发第三个仆人去。他们也打伤了他、把他推出去了。\n20:13 园主说、我怎么办呢。我要打发我的爱子去。或者他们尊敬他。\n20:14 不料、园户看见他、就彼此商量说、这是承受产业的。我们杀他吧、使产业归于我们。\n20:15 于是把他推出葡萄园外杀了。这样、葡萄园的主人、要怎样处治他们呢。\n20:16 他要来除灭这些园户、将葡萄园转给别人。听见的人说、这是万不可的。\n20:17 耶稣看着他们说、经上记着、『匠人所弃的石头、已作了房角的头块石头。』这是甚么意思呢。\n20:18 凡掉在那石头上的、必要跌碎。那石头掉在谁的身上、就要把谁砸得稀烂。\n20:19 文士和祭司长、看出这比喻是指着他们说的、当时就想要下手拿他。只是惧怕百姓。\n20:20 于是窥探耶稣、打发奸细装作好人、要在他的话上得把柄、好将他交在巡抚的政权之下。\n20:21 奸细就问耶稣说、夫子、我们晓得你所讲所传都是正道、也不取人的外貌、乃是诚诚实实传　神的道。\n20:22 我们纳税给该撒、可以不可以。\n20:23 耶稣看出他们的诡诈、就对他们说、\n20:24 拿一个银钱来给我看。这像和这号是谁的。他们说、是该撒的。\n20:25 耶稣说、这样、该撒的物当归给该撒、　神的物当归给　神。\n20:26 他们当着百姓、在这话上得不着把柄。又希奇他的应对、就闭口无言了。\n20:27 撒都该人常说没有复活的事。有几个来问耶稣说、\n20:28 夫子、摩西为我们写着说、人若有妻无子就死了、他兄弟当娶他的妻、为哥哥生子立后。\n20:29 有弟兄七人。第一个娶了妻、没有孩子死了。\n20:30 第二个、第三个、也娶过他。\n20:31 那七个人、都娶过他、没有留下孩子就死了。\n20:32 后来妇人也死了。\n20:33 这样、当复活的时候、他是那一个的妻子呢。因为他们七个人都娶过他。\n20:34 耶稣说、这世界的人、有娶有嫁。\n20:35 惟有算为配得那世界、与从死里复活的人、也不娶也不嫁。\n20:36 因为他们不能再死。和天使一样。既是复活的人、就为　神的儿子。\n20:37 至于死人复活、摩西在荆棘篇上、称主是亚伯拉罕的　神、以撒的　神、雅各的　神、就指示明白了。\n20:38 神原不是死人的　神、乃是活人的　神。因为在他那里、人都是活的。〔那里或作看来〕 20:39 有几个文士说、夫子、你说得好。\n20:40 以后他们不敢再问他甚么。\n20:41 耶稣对他们说、人怎么说基督是大卫的子孙呢。\n20:42 诗篇上、大卫自己说、『主对我主说、你坐在我的右边、\n20:43 等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。』\n20:44 大卫既称他为主、他怎么又是大卫的子孙呢。\n20:45 众百姓听的时候、耶稣对门徒说、\n20:46 你们要防备文士。他们好穿长衣游行、喜爱人在街市上问他们安、又喜爱会堂里的高位、筵席上的首座。\n20:47 他们侵吞寡妇的家产、假意作很长的祷告。这些人要受更重的刑罚。\n\r [2022.12.14 Luke 20:20-26, 27-47]\nQuestion on verse 25, what belongs to God?\nAnswer: Human being because they bear image of God.\nJesus is political correct.\nSlave:\nFree will, chose to be slave of God, love my masters.\nPunched a hole on an ear.\nExodus 21:4-6\nLove gives choice.\nMarriage dissolved when one passed away.\nMicha 6:8\nJames 1:27\nGod look at the heart.\n [2022.12.07 Luke 20:1-26]\nQ: Why were they interested in where Jesus' authority come from?

[1] 22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.\n22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.\n22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\n22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.\n22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\n22:8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.\n22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\n22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.\n22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\n22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.\n22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.\n22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.\n22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,\n22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:\n22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies:\n22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.\n22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. [2]\n22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor:\n22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,\n22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham\u0026rsquo;s brother.\n22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\n[1] [Genesis 22:2] Take now thy son . . and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. Character determines how a man interprets God’s will (cf. Psalm 18:25-26). If we keep true to God, God will take us through an ordeal which will bring us out into a better knowledge of Himself. Don’t ask God to test you. Never declare as Peter did – \"I will do anything, I will go to death with Thee.\" Abraham did not make any such declaration, he remained true to God, and God purified his faith. [April 26, The Supreme Climb](https://www.oswaldchambers.co.uk/classic/the-supreme-climb-2-classic/) \u0026#8617;\n[2] By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this thing…I will bless you… — Genesis 22:16-17 Abraham, at this point, has reached where he is in touch with the very nature of God. He now understands the reality of God.\nMy goal is God Himself…\nAt any cost, dear Lord, by any road.\n“At any cost…by any road” means submitting to God’s way of bringing us to the goal.\nThere is no possibility of questioning God when He speaks, if He speaks to His own nature in me. Prompt obedience is the only result. When Jesus says, “Come,” I simply come; when He says, “Let go,” I let go; when He says, “Trust God in this matter,” I trust. This work of obedience is the evidence that the nature of God is in me.\nGod’s revelation of Himself to me is influenced by my character, not by God’s character.\n’Tis because I am ordinary,\nThy ways so often look ordinary to me.\nIt is through the discipline of obedience that I get to the place where Abraham was and I see who God is. God will never be real to me until I come face to face with Him in Jesus Christ. Then I will know and can boldly proclaim, “In all the world, my God, there is none but Thee, there is none but Thee.”\nThe promises of God are of no value to us until, through obedience, we come to understand the nature of God. We may read some things in the Bible every day for a year and they may mean nothing to us. Then, because we have been obedient to God in some small detail, we suddenly see what God means and His nature is instantly opened up to us. “All the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen…” (2 Corinthians 1:20). Our “Yes” must be born of obedience; when by obedience we ratify a promise of God by saying, “Amen,” or, “So be it.” That promise becomes ours.\n

perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.\n23:7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.\n23:8 For the Sadducees say that there is no

good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.\n23:12 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.\n23:13 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.\n23:14 And they came to the chief priests and

young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.\n23:19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?\n23:20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.\n23:21 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now

had against him.

彼拉多一听见、就问这人是加利利人么。\n23:7 既晓得耶稣属希律所管、就把他送到希律那里去。那时希律正在耶路撒冷。\n23:8 希律看见耶稣、就很欢喜。因为听见过他的事、久已想要见他。并且指望看他行一件神迹。\n23:9 于是问他许多的话。耶稣却一言不答。\n23:10 祭司长和文士、都站着极力的告他。\n23:11 希律和他的兵丁就藐视耶稣、戏弄他、给他穿上华丽衣服、把他送回彼拉多那里去。\n23:12 从前希律和彼拉多彼此有仇。在那一天就成了朋友。\n23:13 彼拉多传齐了祭司长、和、官府并百姓、 23:14 就对他们说、你们解这人到我这里、说他是诱惑百姓的。看哪、我也曾将你们告他的事、在你们面前审问他、并没有查出他甚么罪来。\n23:15 就是希律也是如此、所以把他送回来。可见他没有作甚么该死的事。\n23:16 故此我要责打他、把他释放了。〔有古卷在此有〕 23:17 〔每逢这节期巡抚必须释放一个囚犯给他们〕 23:18 众人却一齐喊着说、除掉这个人、释放巴拉巴给我们。\n23:19 这巴拉巴是因在城里作乱杀人下在监里的。\n23:20 彼拉多愿意释放耶稣、就又劝解他们。\n23:21 无奈他们喊着说、钉他十字架、钉他十字架。\n23:22 彼拉多第三次对他们说、为甚么呢、这人作了甚么恶事呢、我并没有查出他甚么该死的罪来。所以我要责打他、把他释放了。\n23:23 他们大声催逼彼拉多、求他把耶稣钉在十字架上。他们的声音就得了胜、 23:24 彼拉多这才照他们所求的定案。\n23:25 把他们所求的那作乱杀人下在监里的、释放了。把耶稣交给他们、任凭他们的意思行。\n23:26 带耶稣去的时候、有一个古利奈人西门、从乡下来。他们就抓住他、把十字架搁在他身上、叫他背着跟随耶稣。\n23:27 有许多百姓、跟随耶稣、内中有好些妇女、妇女们为他号咷痛哭。\n23:28 耶稣转身对他们说、耶路撒冷的女子、不要为我哭、当为自己和自己的儿女哭。\n23:29 因为日子要到、人必说、不生育的、和未曾怀胎的、未曾乳养婴孩的、有福了。\n23:30 那时、人要向大山说、倒在我们身上。向小山说、遮盖我们。\n23:31 这些事既行在有汁水的树上、那枯干的树、将来怎么样呢。\n23:32 又有两个犯人、和耶稣一同带来处死。\n23:33 到了一个地方、名叫髑髅地、就在那里把耶稣钉在十字架上、又钉了两个犯人、一个在左边、一个在右边。\n23:34 当下耶稣说、父阿、赦免他们。因为他们所作的、他们不晓得。兵丁就拈阄分他的衣服。\n23:35 百姓站在那里观看。官府也嗤笑他说、他救了别人。他若是基督、　神所拣选的、可以救自己吧。\n23:36 兵丁也戏弄他、上前拿醋送给他喝、 23:37 说、你若是犹太人的王、可以救自己吧。\n23:38 在耶稣以上有一个牌子、〔有古卷在此有用希利尼罗马希伯来的文字〕写着、这是犹太人的王。\n23:39 那同钉的两个犯人、有一个讥诮他说、你不是基督么。可以救自己和我们吧。\n23:40 那一个就应声责备他说、你既是一样受刑的、还不怕　神么。\n23:41 我们是应该的。因我们所受的、与我们所作的相称。但这个人没有作过一件不好的事。\n23:42 就说、耶稣阿、你得国降临的时候、求你记念我。\n23:43 耶稣对他说、我实在告诉你、今日你要同我在乐园里了。\n23:44 那时约有午正、遍地都黑暗了、直到申初、 23:45 日头变黑了。殿里的幔子从当中裂为两半。\n23:46 耶稣大声喊着说、父阿、我将我的灵魂交在你手里。说了这话、气就断了。\n23:47 百夫长看见所成的事、就归荣耀与　神说、这真是个义人。\n23:48 聚集观看的众人、见了这所成的事、都捶着胸回去了。\n23:49 还有一切与耶稣熟识的人、和从加利利跟着他来的妇女们、都远远的站着、看这些事。\n23:50 有一个人名叫约瑟、是个议士、为人善良公义。\n23:51 众人所谋所为、他并没有附从。他本是犹太亚利马太城里素常盼望　神国的人。\n23:52 这人去见彼拉多、求耶稣的身体。\n23:53 就取下来用细麻布裹好、安放在石头凿成的坟墓里、那里头从来没有葬过人。\n23:54 那日是预备日、安息日也快到了。\n23:55 那些从加利利和耶稣同来的妇女、跟在后面、看见了坟墓、和他的身体怎样安放。\n23:56 他们就回去、预备了香料香膏。他们在安息日、便遵着诫命安息了。\n\r [2023.02-23 LBC v 1-49]\nJesus' example in suffering. 1 Peter 2:19-20\nMica 6:8\nIsaiah

elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.\n24:2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,\n24:3 We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.\n24:4 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.\n24:5 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:\n24:6 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.\n24:7 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,\n24:8 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.\n24:9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.\n24:10 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:\n24:11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.\n24:12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:\n24:13 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.\n24:14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:\n24:15 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.\n24:16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.\n24:17 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.\n24:18 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.\n24:19 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.\n24:20 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,\n24:21 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.\n24:22 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.\n24:23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.\n24:24 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.\n24:25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.\n24:26 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.\n24:27 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.\n\r24:1 过了五天、大祭司亚拿尼亚、同几个长老、和一个辩士帖土罗、下来、向巡抚控告保罗。\n24:2 保罗被提了来、帖土罗就告他说、\n24:3 腓力斯大人、我们因你得以大享太平、并且这一国的弊病、因着你的先见、得以更正了。我们随时随地、满心感谢不尽。\n24:4 惟恐多说、你嫌烦絮、只求你宽容听我们说几句话。\n24:5 我们看这个人、如同瘟疫一般、是鼓动普天下众犹太人生乱的、又是拿撒勒教党里的一个头目。\n24:6 连圣殿他也想要污秽。我们把他捉住了。〔有古卷在此有要按我们的律法审问〕 24:7 〔不料千夫长吕西亚前来甚是强横从我们手中把他夺去吩咐告他的人到你这里来〕 24:8 你自己究问他、就可以知道我们告他的一切事了。\n24:9 众犹太人也随着告他说、事情诚然是这样。\n24:10 巡抚点头叫保罗说话、他就说、我知道你在这国里断事多年、所以我乐意为自己分诉。\n24:11 你查问就可以知道、从我上耶路撒冷礼拜、到今日、不过有十二天。\n24:12 他们并没有看见我在殿里、或是在会堂里、或是在城里、和人辩论、耸动众人。\n24:13 他们现在所告我的事、并不能对你证实了。\n24:14 但有一件事、我向你承认、就是他们所称为异端的道、我正按着那道事奉我祖宗的　神、又信合乎律法的、和先知书上一切所记载的。\n24:15 并且靠着　神、盼望死人、无论善恶、都要复活、就是他们自己也有这个盼望。\n24:16 我因此自己勉励、对　神、对人、常存无亏的良心。\n24:17 过了几年、我带着赒济本国的捐项和供献的物上去。\n24:18 正献的时候、他们看见我在殿里已经洁净了、并没有聚众、也没有吵嚷。惟有几个从亚西亚来的犹太人。\n24:19 他们若有告我的事、就应当到你面前来告我。\n24:20 即或不然、这些人、若看出我站在公会前、有妄为的地方、他们自己也可以说明。\n24:21 纵然有、也不过一句话、就是我站在他们中间大声说、我今日在你们面前受审、是为死人复活的道理。\n24:22 腓力斯本是详细晓得这道、就支吾他们说、且等千夫长吕西亚下来、我要审断你们的事。\n24:23 于是吩咐百夫长看守保罗、并且宽待他、也不拦阻他的亲友来供给他。\n24:24 过了几天、腓力斯和他夫人犹太的女子土西拉、一同来到、就叫了保罗来、听他讲论信基督耶稣的道。\n24:25 保罗讲论公义、节制、和将来的审判、腓力斯甚觉恐惧、说、你暂且去吧、等我得便再叫你来。\n24:26 腓力斯又指望保罗送他银钱、所以屡次叫他来、和他谈论。\n24:27 过了两年、波求非斯都接了腓力斯的任。腓力斯要讨犹太人的喜欢、就留保罗在监里。\n"},{"id":173,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/009_1_Samuel/1Samuel_24/","title":"1 Samuel 24","section":"1

him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.\n25:4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.\n25:5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.\n25:6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.\n25:7 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.\n25:8 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.\n25:9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?\n25:10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar\u0026rsquo;s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.\n25:11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.\n25:12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.\n25:13 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.\n25:14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul\u0026rsquo;s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:\n25:15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.\n25:16 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.\n25:17 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.\n25:18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:\n25:19 But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.\n25:20 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.\n25:21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.\n25:22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.\n25:23 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.\n25:24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.\n25:25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.\n25:26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord.

And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.\n26:16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;\n26:17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,\n26:18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.\n26:19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:\n26:20 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.\n26:21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.\n26:22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:\n26:23 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.\n26:24 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.\n26:25 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.\n26:26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.\n26:27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.\n26:28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.\n26:29 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.\n26:30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:\n26:31 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.\n26:32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.\n\r26:1 亚基帕对保罗说、准你为自己辩明。于是保罗伸手分诉说、\n26:2 亚基帕王阿、犹太人所告我的一切事、今日得在你面前分诉、实为万幸。\n26:3 更可幸的、是你熟悉犹太人的规矩、和他们的辩论。所以求你耐心听我。\n26:4 我从起初在本国的民中、并在耶路撒冷、自幼为人如何、犹太人都知道。\n26:5 他们若肯作见证、就晓得我从起初、是按着我们教中最严紧的教门、作了法利赛人。\n26:6 现在我站在这里受审、是因为指望　神向我们祖宗所应许的。\n26:7 这应许、我们十二个支派、昼夜切切的事奉　神、都指望得着。王阿、我被犹太人控告、就是因这指望。\n26:8 神叫死人复活、你们为甚么看作不可信的呢。\n26:9 从前我自己以为应当多方攻击拿撒勒人耶稣的名。\n26:10 我在耶路撒冷也曾这样行了。既从祭司长得了权柄、我就把许多圣徒囚在监里。他们被杀、我也出名定案。\n26:11 在各会堂、我屡次用刑、强逼他们说亵渎的话。又分外恼恨他们、甚至追逼他们直到外邦的城邑。\n26:12 那时、我领了祭司长的权柄和命令、往大马色去。\n26:13 王阿、我在路上、晌午的时候、看见从天发光、比日头还亮、四面照着我、并与我同行的人。\n26:14 我们都仆倒在地、我就听见有声音、用希伯来话、向我说、扫罗、扫罗、为甚么逼迫我。你用脚踢刺是难的。\n26:15 我说、主阿、你是谁。主说、我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。\n26:16 你起来站着、我特意向你显现、要派你作执事作见证、将你所看见的事、和我将要指示你的事、证明出来。\n26:17 我也要救你脱离百姓和外邦人的手。\n26:18 我差你到他们那里去、要叫他们的眼睛得开、从黑暗中归向光明、从撒但权下归向　神。又因信我、得蒙赦罪、和一切成圣的人同得基业。\n26:19 亚基帕王阿、我故此没有违背那从天上来的异象。\n26:20 先在大马色、后在耶路撒冷、和犹太全地、以及外邦、劝勉他们应当悔改归向　神、行事与悔改的心相称。\n26:21 因此、犹太人在殿里拿住我、想要杀我。\n26:22 然而我蒙　神的帮助、直到今日还站得住、对着尊贵卑贱老幼作见证。所讲的、并不外乎众先知和摩西所说、将来必成的事。\n26:23 就是基督必须受害、并且因从死里复活、要首先把光明的道、传给百姓和外邦人。\n26:24 保罗这样分诉、非斯都大声说、保罗、你癫狂了吧。你的学问太大、反叫你癫狂了。\n26:25 保罗说、非斯都大人、我不是癫狂、我说的乃是真实明白话。\n26:26 王也晓得这些事、所以我向王放胆直言、我深信这些事没有一件向王隐藏的。因都不是在背地里作的。\n26:27 亚基帕王阿、你信先知么、我知道你是信的。\n26:28 亚基帕对保罗说、你想少微一劝、便叫我作基督徒阿。〔或作你这样劝我几乎叫我作基督徒了〕 26:29 保罗说、无论是少劝、是多劝、我向　神所求的、不但你一个人、就是今天一切听我的、都要像我一样、只是不要像我有这些锁链。\n26:30 于是王、和巡抚、并百尼基、与同坐的人、都起来、\n26:31 退到里面、彼此谈论说、这人并没有犯甚么该死该绑的罪。\n26:32 亚基帕又对非斯都说、这人若没有上告于该撒、就可以释放了。\n"},{"id":177,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/105_Acts/Acts_27/","title":"Acts 27","section":"Acts","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r27:1 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.\n27:2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.\n27:3 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.\n27:4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.\n27:5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.\n27:6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.\n27:7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;\n27:8 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens;

and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.\n27:42 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.\n27:43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:\n27:44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.\n\r27:1 非斯都既然定规了、叫我们坐船往义大利去、便将保罗、和别的囚犯、交给御营里的一个百夫长、名叫犹流。\n27:2 有一只亚大米田的船、要沿着亚西亚一带地方的海边走、我们就上了那船开行、有马其顿的帖撒罗尼迦人、亚里达古、和我们同去。\n27:3 第二天、到了西顿。犹流宽待保罗、准他往朋友那里去、受他们的照应。\n27:4 从那里又开船、因为风不顺、就贴着居比路背风岸行去。\n27:5 过了基利家旁非利亚前面的海、就到了吕家的每拉。\n27:6 在那里百夫长遇见一只亚力山太的船、要往义大利去、便叫我们上了那船。\n27:7 一连多日、船行得慢、仅仅来到革尼土的对面。因为被风拦阻、就贴着革哩底背风岸、从撒摩尼对面行过。\n27:8 我们沿岸行走、仅仅来到一个地方、名叫佳澳。离那里不远、有拉西亚城。\n27:9 走的日子多了、已经过了禁食的节期、行船又危险、保罗就劝众人说、\n27:10 众位、我看这次行船、不但货物和船要受伤损、大遭破坏、连我们的性命也难保。\n27:11 但百夫长信从掌船的和船主、不信从保罗所说的。\n27:12 且因在这海口过冬不便、船上的人、就多半说、不如开船离开这地方、或者能到非尼基过冬。非尼基是革哩底的一个海口、一面朝东北、一面朝东南。\n27:13 这时微微起了南风、他们以为得意、就起了锚、贴近革哩底行去。\n27:14 不多几时、狂风从岛上扑下来、那风名叫友拉革罗。\n27:15 船被风抓住、敌不住风、我们就任风刮去。\n27:16 贴着一个小岛的背风岸奔行、那岛名叫高大、在那里仅仅收住了小船。\n27:17 既然把小船拉上来、就用缆索捆绑船底。又恐怕在赛耳底沙滩上搁了浅、就落下篷来、任船飘去。\n27:18 我们被风浪逼得甚急、第二天众人就把货物抛在海里。\n27:19 到第三天、他们又亲手把船上的器具抛弃了。\n27:20 太阳和星辰多日不显露、又有狂风大浪催逼、我们得救的指望就都绝了。\n27:21 众人多日没有吃甚么、保罗就出来站在他们中间说、众位、你们本该听我的话、不离开革哩底、免得遭这样的伤损破坏。\n27:22 现在我还劝你们放心。你们的性命、一个也不失丧、惟独失丧这船。\n27:23 因我所属所事奉的　神、他的使者昨夜站在我旁边说、\n27:24 保罗、不要害怕、你必定站在该撒面前。并且与你同船的人、　神都赐给你了。\n27:25 所以众位可以放心、我信　神他怎样对我说、事情也要怎样成就。\n27:26 只是我们必要撞在一个岛上。\n27:27 到了第十四天夜间、船在亚底亚海、飘来飘去、约到半夜、水手以为渐近旱地、\n27:28 就探深浅、探得有十二丈。稍往前行、又探深浅、探得有九丈。\n27:29 恐怕撞在石头上、就从船尾抛下四个锚、盼望天亮。\n27:30 水手想要逃出船去、把小船放在海里、假作要从船头抛锚的样子。\n27:31 保罗对百夫长和兵丁说、这些人若不等在船上、你们必不能得救。\n27:32 于是兵丁砍断小船的绳子、由他飘去。\n27:33 天渐亮的时候、保罗劝众人都吃饭、说、你们悬望忍饿不吃甚么、已经十四天了。\n27:34 所以我劝你们吃饭、这是关乎你们救命的事。因为你们各人连一根头发、也不至于损坏。\n27:35 保罗说了这话、就拿着饼、在众人面前祝谢了　神、擘开吃。\n27:36 于是他们都放下心、也就吃了。\n27:37 我们在船上的、共有二百七十六个人。\n27:38 他们吃饱了、就把船上的麦子、抛在海里、为要叫船轻一点。\n27:39 到了天亮、他们不认识那地方、但见一个海湾、有岸可登、就商议能把船拢进去不能。\n27:40 于是砍断缆索、弃锚在海里、同时也松开舵绳、拉起头篷、顺着风向岸行去。\n27:41 但遇着两水夹流的地方、就把船搁了浅。船头胶住不动、船尾被浪的猛力冲坏。\n27:42 兵丁的意思、要把囚犯杀了、恐怕有洑水脱逃的。\n27:43 但百夫长要救保罗、不准他们任意而行、就吩咐会洑水的、跳下水去先上岸。\n27:44 其余的人、可以用板子、或船上的零碎东西上岸。这样、众人都得了救上了岸。\n"},{"id":178,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/105_Acts/Acts_28/","title":"Acts 28","section":"Acts","content":" KJV\r和合本\r\r28:1 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.\n28:2 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.\n28:3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.\n28:4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.\n28:5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.\n28:6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.\n28:7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.\n28:8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.\n28:9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:\n28:10 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.\n28:11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.\n28:12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.\n28:13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:\n28:14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.\n28:15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.\n28:16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.\n28:17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.\n28:18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.\n28:19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.\n28:20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.\n28:21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.\n28:22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.\n28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.\n28:24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.\n28:25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,\n28:26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:\n28:27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.\n28:28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.\n28:29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.\n28:30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,\n28:31 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.\n\r28:1 我们既已得救、才知道那岛名叫米利大。\n28:2 土人看待我们、有非常的情分、因为当时下雨、天气又冷、就生火、接待我们众人。\n28:3 那时、保罗拾起一捆柴、放在火上、有一条毒蛇、因为热了出来、咬住他的手。\n28:4 土人看见那毒蛇、悬在他手上、就彼此说、这人必是个凶手、虽然从海里救上来、天理还不容他活着。\n28:5 保罗竟把那毒蛇甩在火里、并没有受伤。\n28:6 土人想他必要肿起来、或是忽然仆倒死了。看了多时、见他无害、就转念说、他是个神。\n28:7 离那地方不远、有田产是岛长部百流的。他接纳我们、尽情款待三日。\n28:8 当时、部百流的父亲、患热病和痢疾躺着。保罗进去、为他祷告、按手在他身上、治好了他。\n28:9 从此、岛上其余的病人、也来得了医治。\n28:10 他们又多方的尊敬我们。到了开船的时候、也把我们所需用的送到船上。\n28:11 过了三个月、我们上了亚力山太的船、往前行。这船以丢斯双子为记、是在那海岛过了冬的。\n28:12 到了叙拉古、我们停泊三日。\n28:13 又从那里绕行、来到利基翁。过了一天、起了南风、第二天就来到部丢利。\n28:14 在那里遇见弟兄们、请我们与他们同住了七天。这样、我们来到罗马。\n28:15 那里的弟兄们、一听见我们的信息、就出来到亚比乌市、和三馆地方迎接我们。保罗见了他们、就感谢　神、放心壮胆。\n28:16 进了罗马城、〔有古卷在此有百夫长把众囚犯交给御营的统领惟有〕保罗蒙准、和一个看守他的兵、另住在一处。\n28:17 过了三天、保罗请犹太人的首领来。他们来了、就对他们说、弟兄们、我虽没有作甚么事干犯本国的百姓、和我们祖宗的规条、却被锁绑、从耶路撒冷解在罗马人的手里。\n28:18 他们审问了我、就愿意释放我。因为在我身上、并没有该死的罪。\n28:19 无奈犹太人不服、我不得已、只好上告于该撒。并非有甚么事、要控告我本国的百姓。\n28:20 因此、我请你们来见面说话。我原为以色列人所指望的、被这链子捆锁。\n28:21 他们说、我们并没有接着从犹太来论你的信、也没有弟兄到这里来、报给我们说、你有甚么不好处。\n28:22 但我们愿意听你的意见如何。因为这教门、我们晓得是到处被毁谤的。\n28:23 他们和保罗约定了日子、就有许多人到他的寓处来、保罗从早到晚、对他们讲论这事、证明　神国的道、引摩西的律法和先知的书、以耶稣的事、劝勉他们。\n28:24 他所说的话、有信的、有不信的。\n28:25 他们彼此不合、就散了。未散以先、保罗说了一句话、说、圣灵借先知以赛亚、向你们祖宗所说的话、是不错的。\n28:26 他说、『你去告诉这百姓说、你们听是要听见、却不明白。看是要看见、却不晓得。\n28:27 因为这百姓、油蒙了心、耳朵发沉、眼睛闭着。恐怕眼睛看见、耳朵听见、心里明白、回转过来、我就医治他们。』\n28:28 所以你们当知道、　神这救恩、如今传给外邦人、他们也必听受。〔有古卷在此有〕 28:29 〔保罗说了这话犹太人议论纷纷的就走了〕 28:30 保罗在自己所租的房子里、住了足足两年。凡来见他的人、他全都接待、\n28:31 放胆传讲　神国的道、将主耶稣基督的事教导人、并没有人禁止。\n"},{"id":179,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/028_Hosea/","title":"Hosea","section":"Devotional Commentary

阿摩司是一位南国的普通农夫，并不是什么有名的人物，却被神差遣向北国宣告审判，这注定是一个不受欢迎的任务。但先知的事奉并非因为自己为神发热心，而是因为神的话语掌握了他，令他无法抗拒。\n　《何西阿书》让我们看到「神就是爱」（约壹四16），也看到「我们的神乃是烈火」（来十二29）；《阿摩司书》让我们看到神「惟愿公平如大水滚滚，使公义如江河滔滔」（五24）；而《约珥书》和《阿摩司书》合在一起，则全面地阐明了「耶和华的日子」（五18；珥一15）。这三篇放在《十二先知书》的前面，清楚地表明了整卷《十二先知书》的主题：神在「耶和华的日子」的审判，乃是因着祂公义的要求，也是出于祂爱的挽回。因为人已经全然败坏，不可能遵行天父的旨意（太七21）；所以神要彻底拆毁人的肉体生命，将神儿子的生命放到人里面，才能使人活出神的性情。到那时候，信徒才能用外面的行为来印证里面的信心，让世人能「凭着他们的果子就可以认出他们来」（太七20），因为「信心若没有行为就是死的」（雅二17）。\n灭亡前夕的北国社会，与今天许多物质繁荣的国家一样，充满了罪恶：拜金主义流行，政府滥用权力；富人奢华无度，穷人欠债卖身；社会弊病丛生，全民道德低落。更糟糕的是，选民还有自欺欺人的宗教优越感，自以为活在神的祝福当中（五18），有免受审判的特权，自信心和安全感都爆棚（六2-3；九10）；表面上宗教气氛浓厚（四4-5），实际上毫无敬虔的实际（五21-25）。因此，神戳破了北国虚有其表的「属灵泡沫」，宣告：「在地上万族中，我只认识你们；因此，我必追讨你们的一切罪孽」（三2）。\n　有些人断章取义地引用《阿摩司书》，作为教会参与政治的圣经根据。但《阿摩司书》并不是在讲政治，而是在讲「你当预备迎见你的神」（四12）。《阿摩司书》针砭时弊，但所发表的信息并不是为了解决社会的罪恶或道德的问题。因为人已经全然败坏，不可能求善离恶、秉公行义（五14-15），「却使公平变为苦胆，使公义的果子变为茵陈」（六12），甚至「将公义丢弃于地」（五7）；虽然神一再宣告「要寻求耶和华，就必存活」（五4、6、14），但百姓却一面前往伯特利和吉甲寻求代替神的金牛犊（五5），一面追求外邦偶像（五21）。因此，社会问题的解决之道，并不是人的良心发现、道德觉醒或社会革命，也不是高举人道、人权来推行社会公义，而是神的彻底拆毁（三15；七8；八1-2；九1-4、8-10）和重建（九11-15）。\n阿摩司书曾被人作为「解放神学」的依据，用来支持社会改革和革命。但是，北国社会问题的根源，是因为人与神之间的关系出了问题，导致人与人之间的关系也出了问题。即使是神的选民，无论神怎样警告，他们都没有想到这是律法中的咒诅，也没有因为这些警告而回转，何况是那些不认识神的外邦人呢？因此，任何改革或革命的结果，都是「你们仍不归向我」，都不可能解决人类的问题。唯一的解决之道，就是「预备迎见你的神」（12节），接受神彻底的拆毁。\n本书的主要篇幅都是谴责百姓的不公不义和属灵黑暗，宣告神无可避免的审判，九11-15似乎只是结尾的一个附录。但实际上，最后的这段结尾才是本书的中心：人的光景越败坏、越没有希望，越需要神堵住破口、重新修造（11节）。神工作的目的永远都是正面的，祂的拆毁是为了重建，管教是为了恢复，「黑暗没有光明」（五18）的日子，是为了带来光明和盼望。因此，阿摩司书不但让我们看清了人的全然败坏，也让我们渴想神的荣耀救赎。神是公义的、也是信实的，祂既要根据圣约来管教百姓，也要根据圣约来恢复百姓，化腐朽为神奇，把全然败坏的人类重生成承受基业的儿子。亚当的后裔不可能实现神所要求的公平和公义，但神的救赎计划却不会因为人的失败而改变，因为圣约不是倚靠不可靠的人来履行，而是神「亲口应许，亲手成就」（王上八24）。

凡仰望耶和华的人、你们都要壮胆、坚固你们的心。\n\r一.大卫对神的态度：1-8\n一个人对神的态度正确了，后面，神的恩典自然也就能流过来了。大卫对神的态度值得我们效法。\n1.投靠：1-2\n这是我们入门的第一步。我们或许认为自己已经信了这么多年了，也受洗了，也常常参加聚会，这总应该算是投靠神了吧?算，应该是可以算，但是，我们或许还并不懂得什么是投靠神，并未能真正体现投靠神的见证来。也就是说，我们的投靠神和大卫的投靠神或许还有着很大的差距。投靠神是跟从神的起点，我们或许从起点上就没能稳固地踏出第一步。\na.什么是投靠?\n投靠神要有三方面的认识：\n(1).依赖他生活：\n【路15:15】于是去投靠那地方的一个人，那人打发他到田里去放猪。\n‘投靠’一词，在新约中仅出现一次，就是这处经文。浪子在穷苦之后，又遇到那地遭遇了大饥荒。他就去投靠那里的一个人，那人打法他去放猪，还不给他吃饱，以至于他要去与猪抢食物。我们或许会想，猪，是不洁净的动物，他何必去放猪呢?去给人放羊不好吗?更何况还不给他吃饱，如果是给高薪嘛，放放猪也就罢了。我想，如果他能有放羊、放牛的工作，他当然不会去放猪。问题是，在大饥荒中，没有人肯收留他，那些酒肉朋友在他穷苦之后早就不认他了。现在，还有一个人肯收留他，哪怕是放猪，哪怕是吃不饱，但是至少总能吃到一点食物吧。这是告诉我们，浪子是依赖那人生活。\n浪子当时投靠的是一个人，那个人对他并不怎么好，那个人的能力也很有限。而我们投靠的是慈爱的神。既然我们投靠了神，我们就要知道并且确信我们是依赖神而活。很多基督徒信主好多年了，名义上也是投靠神了。但是，在这方面的认识上却很不够，他们常常认为是依赖自己的双手养活自己，是自己的丈夫、儿女养活自己，是政府、国家养活自己……，这样的认识是错误的。我们只能说，是神借着这种种地渠道养活我们，却不能只看见渠道，却看不见他们背后真正的供应者——我们的神。如果认识正确了，即使供应我们的渠道因故断掉了，我们也不担心。因为神还能另辟渠道供应我们，因为我们的神永远活着。\n我们基督徒的谢饭祷告，正是表面我们承认上帝是我们供应者。有的基督徒名义上是投靠上帝了，但是，吃饭时却不谢饭。我不能说，这样的人就不算是投靠神的，但是，至少他们的投靠神与大卫投靠神有很大差距。也有的基督徒，谢饭祷告也是做得，但是，心里面并没有觉得是靠上帝养活。谢饭祷告只是履行一个宗教仪文的活动。这种基督徒的投靠神也是还不够的。我们真的要承认，不但是每顿饭，就是每一口的呼吸，我们都在依赖神而活。\n(2).主动选择投靠对象：\n【得2:12】愿耶和华照你所行的赏赐你。你来投靠耶和华以色列神的翅膀下，愿你满得他的赏赐。\n路得在丈夫死后，拿俄米要回以色列，她完全可以留在自己的摩押地开始新的生活。她的嫂子也回去了，拿俄米也催她回去别跟随自己。路得也知道拿俄米不可能再生孩子娶她了，跟着拿俄米只能是一生受苦。但是，从她坚决要跟随拿俄米的话里，可以看出来她是要投靠以色列的神。这是她主动地选择投靠对象，没有任何人逼她这么做，反倒是反方向推都推不走。浪子的比喻也是这样，浪子投靠那地方的一个人，还是最终投靠自己的父亲，都是他自己所做的决定。\n投靠神也是这样，神不勉强我们，神也不替我们选择。神只是指示我们对错，最终的选择还是由我们自己做出的。\n(3).对外公开承认所属：\n【太10:32-33】凡在人面前认我的，我在我天上的父面前，也必认他。凡在人面前不认我的，我在我天上的父面前，也必不认他。\n我们既然投靠了神，我们就要对外公开承认我们是投靠了他。现在这个时代，在绝大多数地方承认主名已经不再会有什么难处了。但是，有时候被人讥笑几句还是时常会有的。即使这一点点的难处，还会使得一些基督徒不公开承认主名，这就太不像话了。【路9:26】凡把我和我的道当作可耻的，人子在自己的荣耀里，并天父与圣天使的荣耀里，降临的时候，也要把那人当作可耻的。\n过去很多前辈为了公开承认主名，他们影响了前途，下到了监里，甚至献出了生命也在所不惜。\nb.神的应许：\n(1).永不羞愧：\n神应许我们投靠他的人永不羞愧，可是，我们常常觉得会有羞愧。比如，基督徒生病了，家里遭遇灾祸了，孩子成绩总是特别差，家庭非常贫穷……类似这样的事情，外人就会讥笑他们‘你们的神呢?怎么也不帮帮你们啊?’基督徒祷告神、仰望神，最后，神也没给解决这些难题，这不是让我们仰望他的人羞愧吗?\n神的儿女会遇到这一类的羞愧，很正常。圣经中属灵的那些神喜悦的人也遇到。【伯16:10】 他们向我开口，打我的脸羞辱我，聚会攻击我。【诗44:15】我的凌辱，终日在我面前。我脸上的羞愧，将我遮蔽。【耶20:18】 我为何出胎见劳碌愁苦，使我的年日因羞愧消灭呢?【林后6:8】 荣耀羞辱，恶名美名。似乎是诱惑人的，却是诚实的。\n基督徒的人生就像是一台戏，上帝是导演。剧情发展中人物的境遇起起伏伏，基督徒的戏落幕时总是以喜剧收场。世人的戏或许中间也有精彩，但是，结尾时必定都是悲剧收场。神如果让我们演所罗门王，我们就演好这个角色，神如果让我们演乞丐拉撒路，我们也要演好这个角色。\n(2).搭救我：\n在撒旦权下的人，通常情况下，他们若是平平安安，上帝也不会故意给他们灾祸，他们若是按着事故几率遭遇到灾祸，上帝也没有义务搭救他们。但是，对于投靠上帝的人，若是遇到了危险或是灾祸，上帝就会搭救他们。这是有神的应许的。\n大卫在这里的祷告真是细心，也很认识神。他祷告说：“凭你的公义搭救我”。‘凭你的公义’的这几个字就说明大卫知道，一个人在神面前为人如何，会影响上帝搭救他们的情况。换句话说，即使上帝搭救他的儿女也是凭着上帝的公义，神虽然非常爱他的儿女们，爱到愿意舍命的地步。但是，却不会包庇他们，不会充当他们犯罪的保护伞。就像是曾经有一条‘我爸是李刚’的新闻那样，他父亲的能力成了他犯罪的庇护了。上帝不会这样，以色列人是上帝特选的百姓，但是，历史上以色列人受到的苦，甚至比她周围的列邦更厉害，那是因为他们常常犯罪，有时候他们也认为自己是上帝的选民，上帝总得照顾一点吧。\n2.交托：3-5\n这篇诗中的每一节圣经都显得很平淡，因为都是非常普通常见的经文，读完了，也留不下任何印象那种。但是，唯独第五节是整篇诗中最耀眼的一节。因为这节圣经是主耶稣在十字架上所说的七句话中的一句，‘我将我的灵魂交在你的手中’。这是主耶稣的一个交托的祷告。\na.什么是交托?\n交托就是放心的把自己交给对方，然后自己不再为此担心。所以，交托也包括三方面因素：\n(1).对对方了解：\n一个人绝对不会随随便便找个人就把自己交托给对方或把某事交托给对方。一定是首先要了解他有没有能力帮助我。今天，也是一样。我们要仔细了解、比较清楚之后，看看神和其他能帮助我们的东西相比，谁更有能力帮助我们。\n(2).对对方信任：\n如果对方仅仅是有能力，未必能让我们放心交托。因为对方肯不肯接受我们还是一回事，对方肯不肯尽心帮助我们也是一回事。我们交托给谁，必定是我们信任的人。神也会将他自己交托给他信任的人。【约2:24】耶稣却不将自己交托他们，因为他知道万人。那些因着看见神迹而信的人，主耶稣不将自己交托他们。\n(3).交托后，不再担心：\n交托之后，就放心让神做工吧，不要替神瞎操心。即使神安排的一波三折，也不必担心。喻道故事：上了车，自己还挑着担子。\nb.神的应许：\n他会做我们的山寨、岩石、保障，这都是指对我们的保护。第五节下半节还特别强调，我们的神是诚实的神，绝不会有谎言。绝不会说了保护我们却不管我们的事儿。有神做我们的保障，不是说就不会遭受患难逼迫。主耶稣把自己交托上帝，众人还等着看看上帝会不会派以利亚把耶稣从十字架上救下来呢。主耶稣最后却死在了十字架上。主耶稣的交托落空了吗?没有!这正是成就了父的旨意。\n3.依靠：6-8\na.有人依靠虚无的神：\n神只有一位，就是造天地，赐给我气息的神。其它他那些被称为神的都是属于虚无的神，拜它的也要和它们一样归于虚无。可是，拜它们的人却有很多。他们也不想一想，一棵树砍下来刻成一个像就能是神吗?用不完的那部分就用来烧火取暖或烤饼了。这样的神，能给人保护吗?它们自身都难保，不被人抬走，就一动不动。【诗135:16-18】有口却不能言，有眼却不能看，有耳却不能听，口中也没有气息。造他的要和他一样，凡靠他的也要如此。\nb.有人靠车、靠马：\n【诗20:7】有人靠车，有人靠马。但我们要提到耶和华我们神的名。这些具体的东西似乎比虚无的偶像管用。有车就是徒步运输更有能力，有马就是比赤手空拳打战更有能力。没有信心的人，就喜欢借着可见的东西帮助自己，觉得靠这些比靠神更实际一些。靠这些确实也常常能帮助我们达成目标。例如，扫罗打仗不靠上帝也常常得胜。\nc.依靠上帝：\n依靠神最主要的方法就是祷告神，不要让祷告成为履行宗教的仪文，而是要相信神垂听，神成全。依靠神，不是只祷告，其它什么也不做。而是边祷告，边努力去做。\n有些宗派就在不断传播一些错误的教导，他们告诉信徒‘生病了，依靠神，就是只祷告不吃药，不看医生。如果吃药之后病好了，算是神给你医治的，还是你自己吃药好的，就说不清楚了’、‘毕业了，依靠神，就是只祷告不去找工作，不去投简历。如果投了简历之后工作找到了，算是神给你安排的，还是你有本事，就说不清楚了’、‘牧师讲道，依靠神，就是只祷告不要准备讲章。如果自己提前写好讲章，算是神给你的话语，还是你自己的聪明，就说不清楚了’，……。很多弟兄姊妹听到这一类的教训时，常常不觉得错误，甚至还觉得人家那才是‘专心’依靠神，这是属灵高超的人啊。可是，如果我们仔细读一读圣经中那些真正专心依靠神的人，就发现他们既祷告靠神，同时自己又需要尽自己当尽的本分。除非是人当时是没有路可以选择的时候，才可以专凭祷告，因为也没有可做的啦。\n只是还有一点需要提醒的是，我们在做努力的时候，无论做什么，一定要在上帝允许的范围之内。如果在达到目标的过程中，使用弄虚作假、撒谎等种种犯罪的方法，即使再怎么祷告，也不是依靠神的人。一个依靠神的人，他们一定在光明中做事。\n二.大卫的苦况与哀求：9-18\n1.紧急的苦难：9\n紧急的苦难让人特别难受，因为没有时间去适应它。在人没有任何准备的时候突然来到。这类苦难有两种情形：\na.忽然起的风浪：\n有一次，耶稣与门徒在海中行船，海面上突然起了暴风。这风，不是先微微地吹一吹，然后再二级风、三级风……慢慢地加上去的，而是突然狂风大作。往往就是这种突然起得暴风令人猝不及防，措手不及。这些门徒中，虽然半数以上的人都是海边长大的渔夫，可还是大大地胆怯惧怕了。更让他们感到不安的是，耶稣此刻却在船尾睡着了。以至于门徒发出了责怪主耶稣的怨言。\n约伯遭遇的苦难也是突然起得。约伯记第一章一开始让我们看见的是一副多么和谐的画面：约伯的儿女们那天去长兄家里吃饭喝酒。草场上，驴正在安静地吃着草。田地里，牛正在按部就班的耕着地。突然，一灾接着一灾接踵而来。一个报恶信还未走，紧接着又来一个，每一条所报的恶信都是毁灭性的。末了，报信的告诉约伯‘狂风吹到房屋，约伯的十个孩子全部被砸死在房子里’。这种突然极重的打击，是让人无法承受的。可是，约伯凭着信心，仍然称颂耶和华的名。\nb.不能再等的事情：\n有些困难虽然不是突然来的，但是，由于有时间的限制，迫在眉睫的需要解决，已经不能再等下去了，这也是属于紧急的苦难。比如，开学时间马上就到了，孩子在哪里入学还没有着落。或者，未婚姊妹的年龄的年龄已经很大了，现在刚好有一个不错的机会，只是对方条件还不符合，是否还能再等下去。这些急难真得令人如大卫所说，哭得眼睛干瘪。\n2.日久的苦难：10\n【诗31:10】我的生命为愁苦所消耗。我的年岁为叹息所旷废。我的力量因我的罪孽衰败。我的骨头也枯干。\n这种苦难绵延日久，遥遥无期。如果说紧急的苦难如果大火炙烤，那么，这种日久的苦难就如同慢火煎熬。它的痛苦就在于，这种苦难让人看不到前面有一丝希望，让人精神耗尽，力量衰弱，也就是经文说的‘骨头枯干’。\n每逢岁末年初的时候，我们常听到弟兄姊妹的祷告词就是‘你以恩典为年岁的冠冕，你的路径都滴下脂油’，‘恩典’做年岁的冠冕，‘路径’都滴下脂油，多好啊!可是这里大卫却是‘我的年岁为叹息所旷废，我的生命为愁苦所消耗’，这说明大卫也在经历着日久的苦难。圣经中还有许多人也是这样，约瑟经历了十几年的苦难，雅各在舅舅家里就经历了二十年苦难生活。中国许多属灵前辈也是这样经历苦难。\n3.众叛亲离：11-13\n【诗31:11】我因一切敌人成了羞辱，在我的邻舍跟前更甚。那认识我的都惧怕我。在外头看见我的都躲避我。12被人忘记，如同死人，无人记念。我好像破碎的器皿。13我听见了许多人的谗谤，四围都是惊吓。他们一同商议攻击我的时候，就图谋要害我的性命。\na.恶人挑唆：\n我们知道，‘有信仰’的恶人大都同时又非常善于假冒伪善，所以，他们的假冒伪善或许可以欺骗不熟悉他们人。但是，对于他们的邻舍和那些认识他们的人，就隐藏不住了。也就是说，外人或许喜欢他们，但他们熟悉的人不喜欢他们。然而，这节经文让我们看到，大卫的情况却恰恰相反，大卫是一位非常好的人，可是，那些认识他的和他的邻舍也不喜欢他。这真是奇怪了，越是好人，可能不喜欢他的人反而越多。为什么会造成这种情况呢?我们从圣经许多的教导里就能找到答案，那就是——被恶人的挑唆。‘挑唆’一词是一明显的贬义词，我们一看见可能就会说：“那些被别人挑唆的人真笨，自己不会思考啊”。可，事实上，能通过思考不被别人挑唆的人在任何时代都是凤毛麟角，极其稀少的。因为挑唆人的人他们或许有崇高的社会地位，有巧舌如簧的口才，有一定的名誉威信，有看似敬虔的宗教生活……，他们在挑唆别人的时候，他们总能找到他们要攻击对象的‘种种罪行’，他们或许一面在无中生有的恶毒攻击，一面还要在众人面前表现出于心不忍状。\n例：曾经向着主耶稣高喊‘和散那、和散那’的群众，仅仅只经过一个星期，还是这批人就高喊‘钉死他、钉死他’。宁可要彼拉多释放一个真正的杀人犯，也不要释放主耶稣。他们中间许多人都曾得到过的主的恩惠。是什么使他们发生这么大的变化?是领袖的挑唆。【太27:20】 祭司长和长老，挑唆众人，求释放巴拉巴，除灭耶稣。\n例：保罗、西拉在路司得城里一开始受到极大的尊重，城里的祭司带领百姓向他们献祭、献花环，将他们二人视为神灵。但是，转眼之间，还是这群人就拿起石头砸死他们二人。是什么使他们发生如此的变化?还是挑唆。【徒14:19】但有些犹太人，从安提阿和以哥念来，挑唆众人，就用石头打保罗，以为他是死了，便拖到城外。\n例：神借着保罗建立了哥林多教会，可是，保罗差一点就被哥林多信徒抛弃，也是因为有假使徒的挑唆。他们对哥林多人说‘保罗不是使徒’、‘保罗为了贪哥林多人的财’、‘保罗很狡猾，善于用心机牢笼人’、‘保罗没有荐信不正规’……。并且最可怕之处就在于，假使徒攻击保罗的这些话语，他们总能提供似乎真有这么回事的证据。其实，全是他们妄猜加捏造的。\n例：大卫为什么对国家贡献这么大，还是被别人厌烦呢?也是被恶人的挑唆。扫罗可以利用他的地位挑唆。押沙龙谋反之前也是先做了挑唆的工作。\nb.被人忘记：12\n死人很快就会被人忘记，破裂的器皿很快就会被人丢掉而忘记。大卫此时就如同死人，如同破碎的器皿。大卫为国家、为人民付出了很多，但是，落难之后，很快就被人忘记了，着实令人伤心、心寒。经历过一点的人就知道这是多么让人难受的一件事，你曾经为他们所有的付出无人纪念。就像是一个含辛茹苦把儿女们养大的母亲，被她的孩子们抛弃了一样。\nc.被人攻击：13\n如果仅仅是忘记，已经够令人痛苦的啦。还有那些没有忘记他的敌人，正谋划着要害他的命，他们在四围不断施加恐吓的阴云。\n4.哀求：14-18\na.仍旧信靠：14\n即使依靠神‘不管用’也仍旧继续信靠，用信心胜过环境，相信神的应许不会落空。\nb.求你救我：15-17上\n我已经将自己交托耶和华，我终身的事都在你手中，求你不要使仰望你的人羞愧。\nc.求你惩罚恶人：17下-18\n降罚恶人既是对恶人的警告，也是对义人的安慰。尤其提到恶人撒谎，这是很麻烦的一件事，一旦恶人敢撒谎，就会把环境搞乱，众人难辨真伪，破坏信任关系，甚至影响对神话语的信心，现在许多的教会光景也是这样。\n三.大卫的信心：19-24\n1.施行恩惠：19\n【诗31:19】敬畏你投靠你的人，你为他们所积存的，在世人面前所施行的恩惠，是何等大呢。\na.积存的恩惠：\n神为那些投靠他的人积存恩惠，说明恩惠是可以一点一点积存起来的。积存的多少就要看我们努力的程度了。\n比如，我们常常聚会可以积存平安的恩惠。【约20:19】那日，(就是七日的第一日)晚上，门徒所在的地方，因怕犹太人，门都关了。耶稣来站在当中，对他们说，愿你们平安。【约20:26】过了八日，门徒又在屋里，多马也和他们同在，门都关了。耶稣来站在当中说，愿你们平安。\n我们常常读经可以积存真理的恩惠。【西3:16】当用各样的智慧，把基督的道理，丰丰富富的存在心里。只要读经也是有福的，【启1:3】念这书上预言的，和那些听见又遵守其中所记载的，都是有福的。念有念的福，守有守得福。\n我们常常的祷告、奉献、善行等都是在神那里有积存的恩惠。\nb.显明的恩惠：\n这是在世人面前要显明给世人看得恩惠。基督徒一定要经过许多十字架，但是，也不会只有十字架，也会有显明给世人看的恩典。这地是有山有谷之地。许多敬虔的基督徒不但自己蒙恩惠，连他们子孙后代都蒙恩惠。\n2.蒙神保守：20\n【诗31:20】你必把他们藏在你面前的隐密处，免得遇见人的计谋。你必暗暗地保守他们在亭子里，免受口舌的争闹。\na.‘藏’：我们会藏什么东西?板凳、茶杯我们不会藏，垃圾我们更不会藏。要藏，一定是藏贵重的东西。神也把依靠他的人看做宝贝，藏在他面前的隐秘处。感谢主，所以，敬畏神的人，什么也不必惧怕。\nb.‘暗暗地’：人的保护都是大张旗鼓的，别人想伤害他，一看到保护的那阵势也就吓退了。神的保护是暗暗地，所以，恶人敢大胆的去伤害义人，属血气的人敢大胆的去逼迫属灵的人。看扫罗怎么害大卫就知道了。可是，稀奇的是，扫罗总是害不成大卫。眼看着就要捉到大卫了，不早不晚这个时候非利士人犯境，不得不先去处理这事。下一次，眼看着大卫已无路可逃了，突然扫罗又肚子痛要大解了。这都不是巧合，是上帝在暗暗地保护大卫。\n例：约瑟被卖经过，神也是这样暗暗保护。/哈曼要屠杀末底改和犹太人，神也是这样暗暗的保护。如果神发着闪电保护他们，我想，仇敌也不敢这么猖狂了，那他们也就不能自取灭亡了。\nc.‘在亭子里’：我想，如果圣经不是上帝默示而是人写的，如果让我来写，我就会写‘你必暗暗地保守他们在防空洞里’。因为既然神要保护他们，当然就应该把他们安置在最安全、最稳妥的地方喽。防空洞里多安全，飞机都炸不透。可是，‘亭子’四面漏风，很容易被别人发现，也很容易被别人射箭攻击。奇妙就奇妙在这里，神把投靠他的人安放在亭子里，仇敌能看到，仇敌也以为能害到，可就是害不到。其实，亭子不是他们的保障，神才是他们的保障。\n3.曾经误会神：21-22\n【诗31:22】至于我，我曾急促的说，我从你眼前被隔绝。然而我呼求你的时候，你仍听我恳求的声音。\n虽然神的慈爱是坚固永不动摇的，但是，我们却有可能因为小信的原因，因看到环境恶劣而急促地向神发怨言。例：神让摩西见法老带以色列人出埃及，百姓一看到法老不放人，还加重他们的担子就急促地发怨言了，他们误会了神，不懂的神是为了不让他们空手离开。\n4.劝勉：23-24\na.爱神：这是律法和一切道理的总纲，凡是上帝拣选出来的圣民都当爱神。爱神，不是靠嘴巴说的，而是靠遵守主的命令体现的。当然，不是假冒伪善，故意做给人看的那种遵守，因为这种遵守本身就是违背神的话。\nb.坚固：凡是仰望神的人，必定都会和大卫一样经历种种试炼，不要惧怕任何危险、任何恶人，如果胆怯就会退后，或变节，或妥协，这样就不能尊荣神了，也不能得到称赞。要壮胆坚固自己的心。\n诗篇31篇讲解

你必死在你所登的山上、归你列祖〔原文作本民〕去、像你哥哥亚伦、死在何珥山上、归他的列祖一样。\n32:51 因为你们在寻的旷野、加低斯的米利巴水、在以色列人中没有尊我为圣、得罪了我。\n32:52 我所赐给以色列人的地、你可以远远的观看、却不得进去。\n  摩西把雅弗的哥哥闪摆到最后面，因为亚伯拉罕是出于闪的族系，而耶和华是闪的神。\n创世记11章10节记载，“闪的后代记在下面、洪水以后二年，闪一百岁生了亚法撒。”\n为什么“闪的后代”放在最后才提？因为救恩历史的主体是要呼应创世记3章15节的“女人的后裔”。与主有关的，摩西就详细描述。\n创世记第十章末了已经提到闪的儿子，说“闪的儿子是以拦、亚述、亚法撒、路德、亚兰。”而在这里再作必要的补充。主要是表明亚伯兰（就是后来的亚伯拉罕）跟“闪”族的关系。大卫说，“耶和华的筹算永远立定，他心中的思念万代常存。”而神如何筹算？祂心中的思念是什么？借着经文的描述，神就逐步向我们显明。\n在闪的众子里面，神拣选了亚法撒。创世记11章11节记载，“闪生亚法撒之后，又活了五百年，并且生儿养女。”\n闪活了很久，而且生了其他的儿女，但神开始限定，缩窄，把焦点放在亚法撒的身上。\n创世记11章12节记载，“亚法撒活到三十五岁，生了沙拉。”14节，“沙拉活到三十岁，生了希伯。”16节，“希伯活到三十四岁，生了法勒。”\n历代志上1章19节补充，“希伯生了两个儿子：一个名叫法勒‘就是分的意思’，因为那时人就分地居住；法勒的兄弟名叫约坍。”\n在希伯的两个儿子里面，神拣选了法勒，不选约坍。\n创世记11章18节记载，“法勒活到三十岁，生了拉吴。”焦点来到拉吴身上。法勒生拉吴之后，又活了二百零九年，并且生儿养女。那些儿女的名字摩西就不记了。\n创世记11章20节，“拉吴活到三十二岁，生了西鹿。”22节，“西鹿活到三十岁，生了拿鹤。”24节，“拿鹤活到二十九岁，生了他拉。”\n他拉是谁呢？就是亚伯拉罕的爸爸。\n《旷野吗哪》灵修信息

Psalms三十一篇若是如标题所说，是“大卫的诗，交与伶长”，最有可能写作的时间就是当大卫逃避他儿子押沙龙的时候。何以见得呢？Psalms31篇10节，大卫提到，“我的生命为愁苦所消耗，我的年岁为叹息所旷废，我的力量因我的罪孽衰败，我的骨头也枯干。” 神为大卫所犯的罪，因为乌利亚的那件事，差遣拿单去见他。先知拿单到了大卫那里，就对他说：“在一座城里有两个人：一个是富户，一个是穷人。富户有许多牛群羊群；穷人除了所买来养活的一只小母羊羔之外，别无所有。羊羔在他家里和他儿女一同长大，吃他所吃的，喝他所喝的，睡在他怀中，在他看来如同女儿一样。有一客人来到这富户家里；富户舍不得从自己的牛群羊群中取一只预备给客人吃，却取了那穷人的羊羔，预备给客人吃。”大卫就甚恼怒那人，对拿单说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，行这事的人该死！他必偿还羊羔四倍；因为他行这事，没有怜恤的心。”拿单对大卫说：“你就是那人！耶和华以色列的神如此说：‘我膏你作以色列的王，救你脱离扫罗的手。我将你主人的家业赐给你，将你主人的妻交在你怀里，又将以色列和犹大家赐给你；你若还以为不足，我早就加倍地赐给你。你为什么藐视耶和华的命令，行他眼中看为恶的事呢？你借亚扪人的刀杀害赫人乌利亚，又娶了他的妻为妻。你既藐视我，娶了赫人乌利亚的妻为妻，所以刀剑必永不离开你的家。’” 撒母耳记下12章11-12节，先知拿单接着说，“耶和华如此说：‘我必从你家中兴起祸患攻击你；我必在你眼前把你的妃嫔赐给别人，他在日光之下就与她们同寝。你在暗中行这事，我却要在以色列众人面前，日光之下，报应你。’” 大卫的心是痛苦的，他必然想起神借着先知拿单曾经对他讲过的话。他是自己尝到了苦果。多少年日在叹息中度过，他和拔示巴生的儿子死了，长子暗嫩被杀。如今、三子押沙龙起来叛变，后来被杀。以后四子亚多尼雅为所罗门所杀，刀剑果然不离开大卫的家。 他用“借刀杀人”的方法害死了赫人乌利亚，神就让他四个儿子死于非命。正应了这个没有怜恤心的“该死的人”，应“偿还羊羔四倍”这句话。 当大卫流亡在外的时候，饱受羞辱。在Psalms第三篇里面，大卫说，“耶和华阿，我的敌人何其加增，有许多人起来攻击我。有许多人议论我说：‘他得不着神的帮助。’但你耶和华是我四围的盾牌，是我的荣耀，又是叫我抬起头来的。” 当大卫听见他的谋士，他知己的朋友亚希多弗投奔押沙龙，他感到伤心欲绝。他在诗里写道，“连我知己的朋友，我所倚靠吃过我饭的，也用脚踢我。” 因为自己的罪，大卫心里充满忧愁恐惧。Psalms55篇4-5节，大卫说，“我心在我里面甚是疼痛，死的惊惶临到我身。恐惧战兢归到我身，惊恐漫过了我。” 他终日哀声悲叹，渴望脱离这场狂风暴雨。他知道要把重担卸给耶和华，让神领他到那比他更高的盘石。在干旱疲乏无水之地，他渴望得着神的恩惠，能得见神的能力和荣耀。他所倚仗的依然是“神的慈爱”。Psalms63篇3节，大卫说，“因你的慈爱比生命更好，我的嘴唇要颂赞你。” 大卫的祷告是恳切的，Psalms143篇6-9节，大卫对神说，“我向你举手，我的心渴想你，如干旱之地盼雨一样。耶和华阿，求你速速应允我；我心神耗尽，不要向我掩面，免得我像那些下坑的人一样。求你使我清晨得听你慈爱之言，因我倚靠你；求你使我知道当行的路，因我的心仰望你。耶和华阿，求你救我脱离我的仇敌，我往你那里藏身。” 大卫指望的不是岩石、山寨或任何的保障，而是神。他求神听他的祷告，快快救他，为自己名的缘故引导他，指点他。 Psalms31篇21-22节，大卫说，“耶和华是应当称颂的，因为他在坚固城里，向我施展奇妙的慈爱。至于我，我曾急促的说：‘我从你眼前被隔绝。’然而，我呼求你的时候，你仍听我恳求的声音。” 他知道因着神奇妙的大爱，虽然他被迫离开约柜所在的圣城，他相信当他呼求时，神仍然听他的祷告。神若喜悦他，必使他回来，再见约柜和祂的居所。 Psalms143篇10-12节，大卫说，“求你指教我遵行你的旨意，因你是我的神；你的灵本为善，求你引我到平坦之地。耶和华阿，求你为你的名将我救活；凭你的公义，将我从患难中领出来。凭你的慈爱剪除我的仇敌，灭绝一切苦待我的人，因我是你的仆人。” 大卫说，“我将我的灵魂交在你手里。”他知道神必不将他的灵魂撇在阴间。耶和华──诚实的神，必定救赎他。 以别神代替耶和华，信奉虚无之神的人必定要羞愧。但坚心倚靠耶和华的人，必能因祂的慈爱高兴欢喜。 神的慈爱上及诸天，祂的信实达到穹苍。神知道一切，大卫说，“你见过我的困苦，知道我心中的艰难。” 可以想象此时的大卫，比任何时候都要艰难。追逼他的是他自己的儿子，不是当年的扫罗。他求神救他脱离押沙龙的手，但又希望押沙龙能够平安。 大卫知道神不会看着不管，虽然他内心的压力极大，但神未曾把他交在仇敌手里过。当年扫罗天天寻索他，神却不将大卫交在扫罗手中。环境再险恶，他总是能够顺利脱困。今天也不例外，神必定使他的脚站在宽阔之处。 大卫提到，在急难中他的眼睛因忧愁而干瘪，连他的身心也不安舒。他感到自己的生命为愁苦所消耗；他的年岁为叹息所旷废。他的力量因他的罪孽衰败；他的骨头也枯干。因为他所犯的罪追上了他，神命定刀剑必不离开他的家。所以我们当警戒自己，一件恶事都不做。要保守自己常在神的爱中。 在众叛亲离之下，大卫感到自己如同死人，无人记念，又好像破碎的器皿，等着被扔掉。人都是很现实的，一旦见大卫“失势”，就纷纷远离他。大卫说，“那认识我的都惧怕我，在外头看见我的都躲避我。” 撒母耳记下15章12节提到，“叛逆的势派甚大，因为随从押沙龙的人民，日渐增多。” 有大卫从前的谋士、基罗人亚希多弗给押沙龙出主意，叛乱的势力就越来越大。可能一时间大卫还不清楚反叛的势力究竟有多大。他在诗里提到，“我听见了许多人的谗谤，四围都是惊吓；他们一同商议攻击我的时候，就图谋要害我的性命。” 但大卫坚定地说，“耶和华啊，我仍旧倚靠你；我说：你是我的神。我终身的事在你手中。”这是大卫心里确切的把握，他向神呼求，求神救他脱离仇敌的手和那些逼迫他的人。求神使他的脸光照他，凭祂的慈爱拯救他。又求神使恶人羞愧，使他们在阴间缄默无声。 大卫把眼光转向神的恩惠，他说，“敬畏你、投靠你的人，你为他们所积存的，在世人面前所施行的恩惠是何等大呢！” 他不是把难题放大，而是把“神”放大，信靠神的保守和施恩。果然，神眷顾大卫，为他预备了一座坚固城，就是玛哈念。撒母耳记下17章27节，经文记载，“大卫到了玛哈念。” 18章1-4节，经文又说，“大卫数点跟随他的人，立千夫长、百夫长率领他们。大卫打发军兵出战，分为三队：一队在约押手下，一队在洗鲁雅的儿子、约押兄弟亚比筛手下，一队在迦特人以太手下。大卫对军兵说：‘我必与你们一同出战。’军兵却说：‘你不可出战。若是我们逃跑，敌人必不介意；我们阵亡一半，敌人也不介意。因为你一人强似我们万人，你不如在城里预备帮助我们。’王向他们说：‘你们以为怎样好，我就怎样行。’于是王站在城门旁，军兵或百或千地挨次出去了。” 在坚固城里，神向大卫显出祂奇妙的慈爱，让他从这里出发，敉平叛变。当军兵出战的时候，大卫正坐在城瓮里。 感谢神，垂听了大卫恳求的声音。最后，大卫说，“耶和华的圣民哪，你们都要爱他！耶和华保护诚实人，足足报应行事骄傲的人。凡仰望耶和华的人，你们都要壮胆，坚固你们的心。”\n神保护忠于祂，爱祂的人，无论他们的情况在人看来有多凄惨。他们的哀求到最后，必然转为对神的赞美。 请我们一起祷告：\n主啊，你是信实的造化之主，你阻挡骄傲的人，赐恩给谦卑的人。我们所遇见的试探，无非是人所能受的。你是信实的，必不叫我们受试探过于我们所能受的；在受试探的时候，总要给我们开一条出路，叫我们能忍受得住。你为大卫预备了坚固城，让大卫知道你仍然喜悦他。大卫以你的信实为粮，时时以你为乐。他向世人见证谦卑人必承受地土，以丰盛的平安为乐。见证你是扶持义人的，义人的脚步，被你立定，他的道路你也喜爱。他虽失脚，也不至全身仆倒，因为你用手搀扶他。当他四面受敌，走投无路的时候，你用笑脸帮助他。是的，主，敬畏你投靠你的人，必向你发出极大的赞美。因为你为他们所积存的，在世人面前所施行的恩惠，是何等的大！那些在危难中，仍旧倚靠你的人，必能看见你的荣耀，见证你的信实。赐福我们今天所听见的，叫我们的信心更加坚定，对你的名更加敬畏，更有决心仰望你，更愿意传讲你的真理，领人归向你。祷告祈求奉耶稣基督的圣名。阿们。

Commentary

Wars，主前499-449年）结束后不久，希腊文明开始崛起，波斯帝国逐渐走向衰落，而中国是战国初期魏文侯变法的时代。从被掳回归到玛拉基的时代（主前539-434年），中国出现了老子（约主前571-471年）和孔子（约主前551-479年），印度出现了释迦牟尼（约主前480-400年），希腊出现了苏格拉底（约主前470-399年）。\n大部分先知都在动荡不安的年代事奉，玛拉基的时代却是相对风平浪静的等候时期。此时，被掳的百姓回归已经105年，圣殿重建完成已经83年，连耶路撒冷城墙都已经修成了12年，但神却似乎忘记了祂的百姓，任凭他们长期在波斯帝国的统治下，忍受生活的艰难和社会的不公。神迹的时代似乎已经随着以利亚和以利沙成为过去，两个世代过去了，没有任何迹象表明神将「回到锡安」（亚八3）、用荣耀充满圣殿（结四十三4）；先知哈该和撒迦利亚所预言的复兴并没有来到，百姓的火热也逐渐冷淡。回归的百姓虽然不再敬拜偶像，新圣殿的献祭也成了习惯性的周而复始，但人的心中却不再有从前的热忱，反而是疑云重重：神真的爱我们吗（一2）？公义的神在哪里呢（二17）？事奉祂有什么益处呢（三14）？在这段等候的过程中，祭司废弃了利未之约（二8），百姓背弃了列祖之约（二10），而一旦人与神的立约关系被破坏，人与人的婚姻盟约也无法维持（二13），社会关系（二10）、夫妻关系（二13）和父子关系（四6）全都濒临崩溃。\n这时，神差派先知提醒百姓：应当正确地回应立约之神的爱，「保守自己常在神的爱中」（犹21），在等候中守住圣约中当尽的本分（四4），随时预备他们所寻求的主「忽然进入祂的殿」（三1），炼净祂的百姓（三3）。过去，是神自己主动立约，接纳以色列作自己的儿子（一6；二10；三17）；将来，也是神自己负责成就圣约的应许，「领许多的儿子进荣耀里去」（来二10）；而现在，等候是神给立约之民的信心功课，虽然在「耶和华大而可畏之日」来临之前，一代又一代神的百姓「都是存着信心死的，并没有得着所应许的」（来十一13），但「耶和华是不改变的」（三6）。本书是从旧约时代过渡到新约时代的桥梁，让等候神的百姓远远地望见了四百多年以后的曙光。而今天，每个信徒的生命中都有许多等候的时期，神也要我们「凡事谢恩」（帖前五18）、领会和数算神的恩典，才能正确地回应神的爱，凭信心守住本分、「等候得赎的日子来到」（弗四30）。\n"},{"id":193,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/001_Genesis/Genesis_41/","title":"Genesis

chapter 41 where we read of Joseph\u0026rsquo;s elevation from an Egyptian prison to a high and honoured position second only to Pharoah, we noted first of all in verse 42 what Joseph received from the Monarch\u0026rsquo;s own hand as \u0026lsquo;emblems\u0026rsquo; of his new exalted role in the kingdom:\n•\ta ring or a signet\n•\tvestures or clothes of fine linen\n•\ta gold chain around his neck.\nA question arises immediately: does the vindication of Joseph mean that all believers who have suffered the unfairness of false accusation and discrimination live to see their vindication in their earthly lifetime? Is this always the case as it was for Joseph?\nHistory shows clearly that this is not the case. For not a few are called to \u0026ldquo;be faithful unto death\u0026rdquo; (Rev. 2:10).\nBut whether vindicated in life or in death, all will attest to the truth of God\u0026rsquo;s promise in Isaiah 54:4 - \u0026ldquo;Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed\u0026rdquo;.\n(1) We shall not be ashamed of our faith.\n•\tCarping critics may assail the Scriptures upon which we ground our belief - but our Lord will make it more and more clear to all that in His Book there is no error, no excess, no omission.\n•\tIt is never a discredit to be a simple believer in Jesus: for as it has been said: \u0026ldquo;the faith which looks alone to Jesus is a crown of honour on any man\u0026rsquo;s head\u0026hellip;”\n(2) We shall not be ashamed of our hope.\n•\tHow we shall glory in the Lord who first gave us lively hope and then gave us that which we had hoped for! (3) We shall not be ashamed of our love.\n•\tJesus is to us altogether lovely: and never shall we have to blush because we have yielded our hearts to Him.\n•\tFor the sight of our glorious Well-Beloved shall fully justify the most enthusiastic attachment to Him.\nRemember - none will blame the martyrs for dying for Him. When the enemies of Christ are one day clothed with everlasting contempt - the lovers of Jesus shall find themselves honoured by all holy beings because they chose the reproach of Christ more than the vain treasures of Egypt.\nVindicated now or then - it matters not! For vindicated all His own shall be!\nA GREATER THAN JOSEPH\nBefore we move on today - let us ever keep before our minds that Joseph was exalted purely on the ground of his personal worth and for his service unto God that he performed for Egypt\u0026rsquo;s profit.\nWhat a lovely parallel to this we find in our Lord Jesus Christ. Yet because the Son of God excelled Joseph in personal worth and service - so much is His exaltation the higher:\n\u0026ldquo;Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him\u0026hellip;”\n(see Philippians 2:6-11).\nThe crucified One is now the glorified One. Indeed the One whom men once put upon a gibbet has now been placed by God upon His throne. Once, He was here in humiliation and shame - but no longer!\nFor this Jesus is \u0026ldquo;gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto Him\u0026rdquo; (1 Peter 3:22).\nAll power has been given unto Jesus Christ in heaven and in earth (Matthew 28:18). To Him, God has given over the control and the government of the world.\nAUTHORITY PUBLICLY OWNED\n\u0026ldquo;And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt\u0026rdquo; (Genesis 41:43).\nOn the day of Pentecost, Peter declared to the Jews who had crucified the Saviour - \u0026ldquo;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ\u0026rdquo; (Acts 2:36).\nBut my dear reader: Have you recognized this yourself or owned it? Have you recognized the exalted dignity of Christ, and by faith seen that the One who died on the Cross of Calvary is now seated on the right hand of the Majesty on high?\nHave you submitted to His Lordship - so that you live now only to please Him who died in your place? Have you bowed the knee before Him, a Person - and not to a set of theological precepts?\nIf not, may you be constrained to do so without further delay (yea, voluntarily and gladly) - so that you may not be among the eternally lost who shall on a coming Day be compelled to do so! For God hath sworn \u0026ldquo;that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow\u0026hellip;and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father\u0026rdquo; (Philippians 2:10-11).\nTo make this confession willingly means that you have passed from death to life, from judgment to security - and that you have become a child of God and a citizen of a kingdom which can never be destroyed.\nA NEW NAME\nWe are told in Genesis 41:45 that Joseph was given a new name by Pharoah. He was henceforth to be called Zaphnath-Paaneah. It was not unusual in ancient days to give new names to people on particular occasions.\nThis was often done to indicate a time when a person had come under new masters. Some examples of this can be found elsewhere in the Bible: for instance in 2 Kings 23:34 (when Eliakim was given the new name of Jehoahaz by Pharoah Necho - when he was appointed king in place of his father Josiah).\nSo too was Daniel given the new name: Belteshazzar by the chief of the eunuchs in the courts of Babylon. Furthermore his Jewish friends: Hananiah, Mischael and Azariah were respectively given the new names: Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego (see Daniel 1:7).\nIn the case at hand, the new name Zaphnath-Paaneah was given to Joseph as an honorary title. It was, as it were, designed to convey the high esteem in which he was held by the Egyptian king.\nThere is no general consensus among commentators as to the meaning of Joseph\u0026rsquo;s new Egyptian name - or Zaphnath-Paaneah. None are universally in agreement if it means:\n•\tSaviour of the world\n•\tabundance of life\n•\trevealer of secrets\nA German scholar suggested that it could well mean:\nGod speaks and He lives. If this was in truth the real meaning of the name given to Joseph by Pharoah, it would be a marvelous testimony to the character of God which the Egyptian ruler saw in him. Oh, that the same would be noticed in us as God\u0026rsquo;s children!\nFinally, remember that upon His exaltation at the right hand of God, the Lord Jesus Christ was given a Name which is above all names.\n The Greek word for Lord is kyrios. It was the word or the term by which Roman citizens acknowledged the divinity of Caesar. It was therefore a divine title which claimed that none was higher than Caesar.\nWithin the Roman empire, there was also a test word or phrase which was used to \u0026lsquo;check the loyalty\u0026rsquo; of the citizens: Kyrios Kaiser (Caesar is Lord.)\nChristians, who did not say this, were often executed. For when they said Jesus is Lord, they acknowledged that HE ALONE was divine, and not Caesar.\n Remember: it is not enough to acknowledge Jesus as Lord. Demons do that and tremble. But the issue is: do you own Him today as YOUR Lord. Is He? Indeed, does His Name, which is above all names, sound sweetly in your ear when you hear it spoken?\nA BRIDE\nWe also read in the second part of Genesis 41:45 that Pharoah gave Joseph a wife: or Asenath, the daughter of a man named Potiphera - a priest of On. We are not told of any other details of Asenath or of her father.\nIt would appear that Pharoah intended by this union to honour Joseph by strengthening his connection with a prominent Egyptian family. Let us also remember that the will of Pharoah was the law of the land of Egypt. It was not in Joseph\u0026rsquo;s power to turn down this arranged marriage.\n (When we read in Matt. 22:2, \u0026ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son\u0026rdquo;, I wonder if we have ever considered that our union to Jesus was also an arranged marriage?)\n Now that being said, this marriage does raise obvious questions. Was it right for Joseph as a believer in the One and only true God to marry an unbeliever from a foreign nation?\nOne Jewish tradition has it that Asenath was already a convert to Joseph\u0026rsquo;s God. But this isn\u0026rsquo;t at all suggested in the text. Neither are we warranted in any fashion to condemn Joseph for marrying Asenath when the text itself does not remonstrate or criticize him.\nBut let all Christians take heed however: this example in the Word of God is NOT to be used as an excuse to be unequally yoked with an unbeliever (as it is taught clearly in the Scriptures).\n Historical Footnote\nMy readers may find this of some interest. The city of On mentioned in reference to the father of Asenath is called Aven in Ezekiel 30:17. On was one of the oldest cities in the world, situated on the east side of the Nile about five miles above modern Cairo.\nThe city of On was also called Heliopolis by the Greeks or the City of the Sun. Located not far from Memphis in Egypt, this city had Arabs for its founders. Which led a commentator to remark:\n\u0026ldquo;Being an Arabian colony, Heliopolis would not have had in it the base superstitions of Egypt. Rather, the city would have retained some of the patriarchal or the Abrahamic religion to have made a female from there like Asenath to be nearer to the faith of Joseph than in any other part of Egypt.”\n FINAL NOTE\nWe read in Genesis 41:50-51 that two sons were born of the union in marriage of Joseph and Asenath: the firstborn named Manasseh and the youngest bearing the name Ephraim.\nThe fact that the two sons were given Hebrew names\n(who later would assume roles as tribal leaders in the nation of Israel alongside Joseph\u0026rsquo;s brothers) can lead us to think that Asenath had become a believer in the God of Israel.\nWe will in our next study note how the names given to his two sons describe the two distinct chapters which Joseph had experienced: Manasseh (or, suffering) and then Ephraim (or, fruitful).\n \r\rezraLinkifier.setLang('zh-Hans');\rezraLinkifier.linkify(document.body);\r"},{"id":194,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/024_Jeremiah/Jeremiah_42/","title":"Jeremiah 42","section":"Jeremiah","content":"KJV\r和合本\r\r\r\r42:1 众军长、和加利亚的儿子约哈难、并何沙雅的儿子耶撒尼亚、〔耶撒尼亚又名亚撒利雅见四十三章二节〕以及众百姓、从最小的、到至大的、都进前来、\n42:2 对先知耶利米说、求你准我们在你面前祈求、为我们这剩下的人祷告耶和华你的　神。我们本来众多、现在剩下的极少这是你亲眼所见的。\n42:3 愿耶和华你的　神指示我们所当走的路、所当作的事。\n42:4 先知耶利米对他们说、我已经听见你们了。我必照着你们的话祷告耶和华你们的　神。耶和华无论回答甚么、我必都告诉你们、毫不隐瞒。\n42:5 于是他们对耶利米说、我们若不照耶和华你的　神差遣你来说的一切话行、愿耶和华在我们中间作真实诚信的见证。\n42:6 我们现在请你到耶和华我们的　神面前、他说的无论是好是歹、我们都必听从。我们听从耶和华我们　神的话、就可以得福。[1] 2022.02.07 我在找工作。这次在面试几家单位。心里有盘算，很想去UBC的Soma实验室。不知道是不是像约哈难和众百姓那样，我心仪的单位成了“埃及”。 42:7 过了十天、耶和华的话临到耶利米。\n42:8 他就将加利亚的儿子约哈难、和同着他的众军长、并众百姓、从最小的、到至大的、都叫了来、\n42:9 对他们说、耶和华以色列的　神、就是你们请我在他面前为你们祈求的主、如此说、\n42:10 你们若仍住在这地、我就建立你们必不拆毁、栽植你们并不拔出。因我为降与你们的灾祸后悔了。\n42:11 不要怕你们所怕的巴比伦王。耶和华说、不要怕他。因为我与你们同在、要拯救你们脱离他的手。\n42:12 我也要使他发怜悯、好怜悯你们、叫你们归回本地。\n42:13 倘若你们说、我们不住在这地、以致不听从耶和华你们　神的话、\n42:14 说、我们不住这地、却要进入埃及地、在那里看不见争战、听不见角声、也不至无食饥饿。我们必住在那里。\n42:15 你们所剩下的犹大人哪、现在要听耶和华的话。万军之耶和华以色列的　神如此说、你们若定意要进入埃及、在那里寄居。\n42:16 你们所惧怕的刀剑、在埃及地必追上你们。你们所惧怕的饥荒、在埃及要紧紧的跟随你们。你们必死在那里。\n42:17 凡定意要进入埃及在那里寄居的、必遭刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫而死、无一人存留、逃脱我所降与他们的灾祸。\n42:18 万军之耶和华以色列的　神如此说、我怎样将我的怒气和忿怒倾在耶路撒冷的居民身上、你们进入埃及的时候、我也必照样将我的忿怒倾在你们身上、以致你们令人辱骂、惊骇、咒诅、羞辱、你们不得再见这地方。\n42:19 所剩下的犹大人哪、耶和华论到你们说、不要进入埃及去。你们要确实的知道我今日警教你们了。\n42:20 你们行诡诈自害。因为你们请我到耶和华你们的　神那里、说、求你为我们祷告耶和华我们　神、照耶和华我们的　神一切所说的告诉我们、我们就必遵行。\n42:21 我今日将这话告诉你们。耶和华你们的　神为你们的事、差遣我到你们那里说的、你们却一样没有听从。\n42:22 现在你们要确实的知道、你们在所要去寄居之地必遭刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫而死。\n[1] 约哈难和众百姓口里求神「指示我们所当走的路，所当做的事」（3节），心里早已决定要去埃及（四十一17），只不过是希望能得到神的认可、让自己心安理得。这样的立志是在妄称神的名（5节），这样的心思是把神当偶像操纵。实际上，他们去埃及之前向神求问，到了埃及就向天后烧香（四十四17），神和偶像对于他们并没有区别。 百姓请先知耶利米求问「耶和华 - 你的神」（2、5节），表明他们与神的关系并不亲密。但先知却说「耶和华——你们的神」（5节），强调他们是与神立约的百姓。百姓又改口称「耶和华 - 我们神」（6节），实际上只是他们想象中的那位迎合自己心意、使自己「可以得福」（6节）的神。 这些人经历了耶路撒冷的被毁，「亲眼所见」（2节）先知所预言的灾祸，表面上已经谦卑下来、学到功课，话也说得非常属灵（5-6节）。但他们求问神的态度其实和西底家一样（2节；三十七17），心口不一、内心狂傲（四十三2），并没有醒悟回转、悔改顺服。因为他们所关心的并不是神的旨意，而是自己的利益，所以并不打算为顺服付出代价。\r[source ](https://cmcbiblereading.com/2016/07/28/%e8%80%b6%e5%88%a9%e7%b1%b3%e4%b9%a6%e7%ac%ac42%e7%ab%a0%e9%80%90%e8%8a%82%e6%b3%a8%e8%a7%a3%e3%80%81%e7%a5%b7%e8%af%bb/)\u0026#8617;\n\r"},{"id":195,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/019_Psalms/Psalm_046/","title":"Psalm 46","section":"Psalms","content":"46:1 〔可拉后裔的诗歌、交与伶长、调用女音。〕　神是我们的避难所、是我们的力量、是我们在患难中随时的帮助。\n46:2 所以地虽改变、山虽摇动到海心、 46:3 其中的水虽匉訇翻腾、山虽因海涨而战抖、我们也不害怕。〔细拉〕\n46:4 有一道河。这河的分汊、使　神的城欢喜。这城就是至高者居住的圣所。\n46:5 神在其中。城必不动摇。到天一亮、神必帮助这城。\n46:6 外邦喧嚷、列国动摇。神发声、地便熔化。\n46:7 万军之耶和华与我们同在。雅各的　神是我们的避难所。〔细拉〕\n46:8 你们来看耶和华的作为、看他使地怎样荒凉。\n46:9 他止息刀兵、直到地极。他折弓、断枪、把战车焚烧在火中。\n46:10 你们要休息、要知道我是　神。我必在外邦中被尊崇、在遍地上也被尊崇。1\n46:11 万军之耶和华与我们同在。雅各的　神是我们的避难所。\n  It is so when we are tempted to faint under affliction.

Genesis 14:13 says, “And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew.” Abraham was a Hebrew. As a result of considerable study, we discovered that the root of the word Hebrew means “to pass ” It especially means to pass over a river from one region to another and from one side to another. Therefore, the word Hebrew means a crosser, a river crosser, one who crosses a river. Abraham was a river crosser. He crossed that great flood (Josh. 24:2-3). Abraham crossed the Euphrates. The Euphrates is the modern name of that great river which in Hebrew is called Perath. That great river separated the old region out of which Abraham was called from the new land into which he entered.\nAbraham was born in Chaldea, the site of ancient Babylon, Babel. Between Chaldea and the good land of Canaan was a great river flowing from north to south. This is very meaningful. All things, including the land, were created by God to fulfill His purpose. The land of Chaldea became satanic, devilish, and demonic. It was a land filled with idols, a land totally usurped by God’s enemy and possessed by the evil one. So God intervened to call Abraham out of that idolatrous land, out of that land which had been usurped, possessed, poisoned, corrupted, and ruined by Satan.\nWitness Lee | Life-Study of Hebrews, Message One\n Genesis 11:27-28 Terah was the father of Abram, \u0026hellip;.

Just as the eyes of a servant are riveted on his master, our eyes should be directed to and focused on God. This is how knowledge of His countenance is gained and how God reveals Himself to us (see Isaiah 53:1). Our spiritual strength begins to be drained when we stop lifting our eyes to Him. Our stamina is sapped, not so much through external troubles surrounding us but through problems in our thinking. We wrongfully think, “I suppose I’ve been stretching myself a little too much, standing too tall and trying to look like God instead of being an ordinary humble person.” We have to realize that no effort can be too high.\nFor example, you came to a crisis in your life, took a stand for God, and even had the witness of the Spirit as a confirmation that what you did was right. But now, maybe weeks or years have gone by, and you are slowly coming to the conclusion — \u0026ldquo;Well, maybe what I did showed too much pride or was superficial. Was I taking a stand a bit too high for me?\u0026rdquo; Your \u0026ldquo;rational\u0026rdquo; friends come and say, \u0026ldquo;Don’t be silly. We knew when you first talked about this spiritual awakening that it was a passing impulse, that you couldn’t hold up under the strain. And anyway, God doesn’t expect you to endure.\u0026rdquo; You respond by saying, “Well, I suppose I was expecting too much.” That sounds humble to say, but it means that your reliance on God is gone, and you are now relying on worldly opinion. The danger comes when, no longer relying on God, you neglect to focus your eyes on Him. Only when God brings you to a sudden stop will you realize that you have been the loser. Whenever there is a spiritual drain in your life, correct it immediately. Realize that something has been coming between you and God, and change or remove it at once.\nsource: My Utmost for His Highest: November 24\n 仰望的方向\r看哪，仆人的眼睛怎样望主人的手……我们的眼睛也照样望耶和华我们的神……（诗一二三2）\n这节经文是对神完全信赖的描写。仆人的眼如何注视主人，我们的眼也同样仰望神，以致对他的容貌认识日增（赛五十三1）。我们一不仰望神，就产生属灵的漏症。这漏症不是由於外在的烦恼，而是在於我们有这样的幻想：[我想自己伸展得太用力了，用脚尖站立，努力像神，而不作一个谦卑平凡人。]要知道并没有太过竭力这一回事。\n例如：你因为神而面临危机，但你有圣灵的印证，知道怎样去作才对。可是随着年日过去，你却逐渐有这样得结论 – [看来，我不是过分自负吗？我所作得不是太【过火】么？]你那些讲理智的朋友说：[别傻啦，你当时说起那个属灵醒觉，我们就看出是一时的冲动，你受不起那种压力的，神也不期望你这样做。]你就会说：[这个，我想自己的期望也太高了。]听来多谦卑，可是对神的信赖已尽失，开始信赖世界的见解。你不再仰赖神，不再抬头注视他，这就是危机。惟有等到神突然把你停住，你才晓得自己是在倒退。所以，一发现有漏症，就该立即补救。要承认在你与神之间有了阻隔，并且要立刻去对付。\n祈祷◆噢，主啊，我在举止和行为上何等缓慢地表现神仁慈的恩典！你的美善何时才为着你的荣耀临到我身上？\nsource: 每日灵粮：《竭诚为主》11月24日 仰望的方向\n\r The Distraction of Contempt\rMy Utmost for His Highest\nby Oswald Chamber\n Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us! For we are exceedingly filled with contempt. — Psalm 123:3\n What we must beware of is not damage to our belief in God but damage to our Christian disposition or state of mind. “Take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously” (Malachi 2:16). Our state of mind is powerful in its effects. It can be the enemy that penetrates right into our soul and distracts our mind from God. There are certain attitudes we should never dare to indulge. If we do, we will find they have distracted us from faith in God. Until we get back into a quiet mood before Him, our faith is of no value, and our confidence in the flesh and in human ingenuity is what rules our lives. difference: faith vs confidence\nBeware of “the cares of this world…” (Mark 4:19). They are the very things that produce the wrong attitudes in our soul. It is incredible what enormous power there is in simple things to distract our attention away from God. Refuse to be swamped by “the cares of this world.”\nAnother thing that distracts us is our passion for vindication. St. Augustine prayed, “O Lord, deliver me from this lust of always vindicating myself.” Such a need for constant vindication destroys our soul’s faith in God.

If calm doth not reign over that inner lake within the soul, which feeds the rivers of our life, the rivers themselves will always be in storm. Our outward acts will always tell that they were born in tempests, by being tempestuous themselves. We all desire to lead a joyous life; the bright eye and the elastic foot are things which we each of us desire; to carry about a contented mind is that to which most men are continually aspiring. Let us remember, that the only way to keep our life peaceful and happy, is to keep the heart at rest; for come poverty, come wealth, come honor, come shame, come plenty, or come scarcity, if the heart be quiet, there will be happiness anywhere. But whatever the sunshine and the brightness, if the heart be troubled, the whole life must be troubled too. [\"Gleanings among the Sheaves\" by Charles H.

And that is, I say, a failure to realize our true and full relationship to the death of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n \rI\u0026rsquo;d like to call your attention this morning to the first two verses in the sixth chapter of Paul\u0026rsquo;s epistle to the Romans, the epistle to the Romans chapter six, and the first two verses,\n 1 what shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?\n2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?\n And I want to deal particularly with that second verse and the parallel similar complementary statements, which are found in this chapter, God forbid, how shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? Now the apostle liberal, this sixth chapter in the following chapters, in reply to that question that he puts forward in this first verse, What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, the grace may abound? It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that he himself thought of that question. But that he knew that many of you possibly in Rome, and certainly many elsewhere, were very definitely raising that question in the light of the apostles own teaching. And it\u0026rsquo;s a question that the natural mind will always rails. When it reads the kind of thing that the apostle says in the fifth chapter of this epistle to the Romans. There he had been working out his great doctrine of the imputation of the righteousness of Christ to the believer. It well rounded up in that magnificent statement of his, where sin abounded, grace did much more abounded and at once the natural mind says, well, of course, if that\u0026rsquo;s so, if it\u0026rsquo;s true to say, in a sense that the more sin the bounds of grace knows much more about, well, let us sin, the more we sin, the more grace will abound.\n[2:10]So grace becomes a wonderful [cloak for sale??] indeed, almost an encouragement to say, the apostle never knew that many did argue in that way, he was constantly being charged with teaching what is called antinomianism. That his gospel of grace was such as to give the impression that Law no longer counted in any sense at all, and that sin didn\u0026rsquo;t matter, that nothing mattered serve this wonderful grace of God that covered our sins in such an overwhelming manner.\n[2:45] Surely, the apostle [whiles ??] a teacher, as he was, anticipates this criticism, even from the church in Rome, and takes it up at once and deals with it.\n[2:55]He rejects it with [harm ??] God forbid it. And then he goes on to say, however, not only is it unreasonable, and an utterly false deduction to draw from his teaching, but the furthermore, anybody who ever thinks like that, who speaks like that, is showing quite clearly that he\u0026rsquo;s never understood the doctrine. For the doctrine of Paul, truly understood, is a doctrine which teaches not only that grace does not incite one to sin. But that grace, in a sense makes it impossible for one to sin. And that ultimately, its grand purpose is to deliver us entirely from sin and all its consequences. Now, that is what the Apostle does.\nNow, I\u0026rsquo;m calling your attention to it all this morning. Not precisely in that way, but from a slightly different angle. It\u0026rsquo;s the same argument exactly. But we are going to deal with his argument not in reply to this theoretical question that he poses, but in a slightly more practical manner. We have been engaged for a number of Sunday mornings now with this problem, this question which we have described as spiritual depression. We are considering the case of the miserable Christian. The case of men and women who, while clearly Christian, are not happy in their Christian lives and they\u0026rsquo;re not enjoying their Christian lives. We are considering the case of those Christians whose lives in to be bound in shallows and in miseries.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;ve been considering some of the greatest causes of that and applying the remedy and the cure, which is provided for us in the New Testament scriptures. Now, we can refer to another cause of this depression.\n[4:59]This defeatism(??) is unhappiness in the Christian life as it afflicts so many. And the particular one that obviously is dealt with here is depression, or disappointment or unhappiness in the Christian life, which arises from a sense of failure in living the Christian life. The sense of depression that arises because we tend to feel that we are being conquered by sin, rather than conquering sin. There are many people like that they\u0026rsquo;ve been Christians for years, and yet they are unhappy, and they\u0026rsquo;re always analyzing themselves and condemning themselves. And this is the cause they say, I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be living the Christian life as it should be lived.\n[5:49]I\u0026rsquo;m not getting this sense of victory and of [conquest ??]. They are aware of failure in the actual practical living of the Christian life, and particularly in this whole question of the conflict with sin and with evil, and with temptation. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s a very great subject, of course, and there are many causes for that failure, and many causes of that feeling. But we can be perfectly settled. That the main cause, the fundamental cause, of which all the other causes are better subsidiary manifestations. The central cause, is the thing that the apostle deals within this chapter. And that is, I say, a failure to realize our true and full relationship to the death of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. And that is the thing that which I want to call your attention this morning. This is Palm Sunday.\n[6:52]Now [the apostle threw concern here is to deliver Nolan women ??] from that appealing misunderstanding and incomplete understanding of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross. [very well, then I say that I know that raises a future without us this profound question ??]. What exactly was happening there? What was it? What\u0026rsquo;s it mean? What does it really say to us? God granted, we may take hold upon this. Not only that our thinking may be adequate during these coming days. But in order that we may enter into the glorious liberty of the children of God. It is only a true understanding of the cross that does that. And all sanctification comes out of the cross. The cross is central in all these matters, very well done.\n[7:47]What is it? Well, [now then the ??] answer is this. The apostle rarely has been giving the whole answer in the previous chapter. The fifth chapter, not the whole answer, but the basic consideration. It\u0026rsquo;s there starting at that 12 verse where we began to read in the fifth chapter and it runs right through this present sixth chapter, and indeed goes on also to the seventh. The writer understand what really happened on the cross on Calvary hill is to know something about the biblical doctrine of the covenant. The biblical doctrine of the covenant. I say you don\u0026rsquo;t begin to understand the cross until you understand the covenant. What do I mean by that? I mean this. The way to approach the cross is to understand the great covenant that was made between God the Father and God the Son before the very foundation of the world. The Covenant was there made between the Father and the Son, and it was this. God knew that man was going to sin, and going to fall in all the consequences of sin and the fall. And he made a covenant with his son, and he gave unto his son certain people out of humanity, who ought to be redeemed and rescued.\nAnd the Son came into the world to do with it. You remember how he puts it himself in his great high priestly prayer, that just under the very shadow of the cross, listen, as though has given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him. Read again, the 17th of John. It\u0026rsquo;s a great exposition of this idea of the covenant. God has given these people to the Son, and the Son came into the world to do something to redeem and to rescue those people. And furthermore, it goes on to say this that All these people are in union with the Lord Jesus Christ. They are all done to him. Now take this great working out of the argument in the fifth chapter of this epistle to the Romans, did you notice it? Here is the argument, Paul keeps on saying that the relationship of Christians to the Lord Jesus Christ, is exactly the same, as was the relationship of the whole of mankind to Adam. You notice how he kept on saying it, as in Adam, so in Christ. He repeats that argument in the first epistle to the Corinthians and in the 15th chapter, but here it is, as by one man\u0026rsquo;s offense, so by one man\u0026rsquo;s obedience. Adam, Christ, it\u0026rsquo;s an exact parallel. And this is his argument. In Adam, he tells us, the whole human race fell, why? well for this reason that Adam was not only the head of the human race, he was also the representative of the human race. The whole of the human race was in Edden,\n[11:11]moreover God appointed Adam as [the federal head ??] and representative of the entire human race. So this is what happens. When Adam sinned and fell, the entire human race sin then fell with him. That\u0026rsquo;s the argument of the fifth Romans. Read it again for yourselves at leisure. He says well for us by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin. And so death passed upon all men so that all have sinned, and they all sinned in (missing a word ??). It is his one transgression spirit. It\u0026rsquo;s no use saying that you don\u0026rsquo;t like that sort of statement. You either accept the scripture or you don\u0026rsquo;t. So you\u0026rsquo;re saying, I think it\u0026rsquo;s unfair, my dear, my dear friend, are you kidding you a little mind against that of God and God\u0026rsquo;s gracious purpose. That is the teaching of the scripture, that we are all in Adam, and we\u0026rsquo;ve all fallen with Adam. And we\u0026rsquo;ve all derived the consequences of Adam\u0026rsquo;s sin, that is the doctrine of original sin and of original guilt.\n[12:25][But, thank God for the but, for a brings in the entire Gospel ??]. Now comes the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And the statement and the argument is, that all who believe in Him now we\u0026rsquo;re in the same relationship to him, the Lord Jesus Christ, as they were before to Adam. with the Lord Jesus Christ, in a vital and in a mystical sense. The Father has given us to him, and we are joined to Him, He is in us and we are in Him, the union of the believer with Christ. It\u0026rsquo;s a great doctrine in the scripture, and I am suggesting this month, we cannot possibly understand the true meaning of the cross, unless we are clear about this doctrine of the covenant and of the mystical union of believers, with the Lord Jesus Christ.\nNow then what does it mean? It means this, all that happened to him, has also happened to us therefore. Adam sinned, because of the relationship, we sinned with Him.\n[13:43] Christ has done certain things, because of the relationship that subsists(??) between us, we have also done those things. That\u0026rsquo;s the argument of these two chapters. The Lord Jesus Christ, you say died on our behalf. Yes, perfectly true. But it is equally true to say this, that as he was doing it all, we were doing it in him and with him. That\u0026rsquo;s the proof. That\u0026rsquo;s the that\u0026rsquo;s the case. So we are told a number of things in this chapter. And elsewhere in the scriptures, here are some. We are told that we were crucified with him. The apostle goes on saying that not only in this epistle, but in the epistle to the Galatians and elsewhere. I have been crucified with Christ. I was crucified with Christ Jesus. So on the cross and Calvary, it isn\u0026rsquo;t simply that the Son of God was being crucified. I was being crucified with him because I am in Him, I am bound to him. Not only that we\u0026rsquo;ve died with him. No, you\u0026rsquo;re not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death. We are baptized into him forget what a baptism at that point, the important thing is that it means that we are incorporated into him. That is the way he describes the union. The means don\u0026rsquo;t matter at that point at all. The fact is that we are baptized into Christ. We have all says the apostle again in one Corinthians 12, verse 13, we have all been baptized by one spirit into this one body, the body of Christ, which is the church, that\u0026rsquo;s it. Now then there is the indissoluble union. And therefore he says, because of that we have died with him. Indeed, he goes further, we are buried with Him, we have been buried with him, by baptism into this. You\u0026rsquo;ll see everything that\u0026rsquo;s happened to him has happened to us. That\u0026rsquo;s the inevitable conclusion which you must draw from this doctrine of the covenant and of the union. And then he goes on to say that we\u0026rsquo;re not only buried with him, but that we\u0026rsquo;ve also risen with him. Of course, we must, everything that happens to him has happened to us. If we are one with Him, nothing happens to him. But it happens to us also. So we are risen again. If he therefore be risen with Christ, He says, God willing, we are going to consider that next Sunday morning. And indeed, the apostle, you remember, goes even further, in the second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, in the fifth verse, where he actually says that we\u0026rsquo;ve not only been quickened with him, and raised with Him, but that we are seated with Him in the heavenly places. And we must be. If this doctrine of the union is correct, and it\u0026rsquo;s the whole teaching of the Scripture, everything that happens to him happens to us. So we are seated with Him in the heavenly places. Now then there, then I say, are the specific actual statements which are made here by the apostle. And his concern is to say that in the light of all this, this argument of let us continue in sin, that grace may be abandoned something that is utterly inconceivable. Indeed, it is impossible, it can\u0026rsquo;t happen. That we this morning are concerned in particular with this aspect of the crucifixion, and the death.\nWhat are we told about that? Well, there are certain statements again, which are made here and which the apostle makes elsewhere. And I must call your attention to the first thing that he tells us, therefore that must be true of us, because of all that is this. We are dead to sin. That\u0026rsquo;s the second verse, God forbid, he says,\n[17:55]How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer [than now ??] at this point The Authorized Version is not only poor and weak, but it\u0026rsquo;s misleading. This is one of those cases where the revised version is altogether superior. What it really is saying is that, God forbid, how shall we, that have died to sin, live any longer then. it isn\u0026rsquo;t our death, it\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s happening once and for all, we have died to sin. That\u0026rsquo;s the apostle statement. He then goes on to show how we have died to sin, because of this human being baptized into him and effort into everything that happened to him. But here\u0026rsquo;s the result. We have died to sin. Every Christian is a person who has died to sin. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s not an argument. It\u0026rsquo;s a categorical statement. But again, he\u0026rsquo;s puts it like this in the sixth verse, knowing this, that our old men is crucified with Him, again takes a Revised Version. Our old men was crucified with Him. When was my old man crucified with him when he was crucified on the cross on Calvary\u0026rsquo;s hill. That\u0026rsquo;s the significance of the cross.\n[19:19]My old men, my old nature rouse(??) has been crucified with Christ. It\u0026rsquo;s happened.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the sixth verse of this sixth chapter of the epistle to the Romans. Then there are other statements which he deduces, and he puts them in this form. The result of all this is that we our Christians are dead to the law. We have died to the law. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain in a moment what that means. But the categorical fact is that we have died, we are dead to the law. And again, he puts it like this In Galatians, six in the 14th verse,\n[20:04]God forbid that I should glory save in the cross, or(??) my Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified unto me, and I have been crucified onto the world. I have been crucified unto the world, and the world has been crucified unto me. Those are his deductions. And finally, he has this astounding statement in the third chapter of the epistle to the Colossians in the third verse, you are dead, you are dead, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.\n[20:52] Now, here surely, are(??) the most momentous statements that can ever confront us while we are in this life. What\u0026rsquo;s it all mean?\n[21:03]What\u0026rsquo;s it all a mountain(??)? What am I to say to myself in the light of all these things? Now, here are the deductions which I would put for your consideration. The first is this, that all these things are facts. They are not something that I am to regard as if they were facts. That isn\u0026rsquo;t what the apostle is saying. All this doctrine is a statement of fact, though, let me put it in as bold and as blunt and as challenging manner as I can, I\u0026rsquo;ll put it like this. I am as much in Christ at this moment as I shall ever be. You agree with it, I am as much in Christ now, as I shall be when I\u0026rsquo;m in the glory.\n[22:09 no question marks here] It is a fact. it is something that has happened. It is something that has been done by God. I have died with him. I have been buried with him. I have risen with him. I am seated with Him in the heavenly places. Now let\u0026rsquo;s be clear about this. My knowledge of that and my realization of that can grow and increase and develop and they should. But as to the fact itself, that can\u0026rsquo;t grow, that can\u0026rsquo;t develop.\n[22:56]You\u0026rsquo;re either in Christ [or Asia??], not in Christ, you can\u0026rsquo;t be partly in them partly out, you can\u0026rsquo;t be going in and out. You are either in Christ forever, or you\u0026rsquo;re not in Christ. The thing itself is a fact. And you know half of our troubles and half of depressions are due to this, that we confuse the fact and our consciousness of it. I was talking in this pulpit last Friday night about Martin Luther and the Reformation. And the doctrine of justification by faith only, you know, it was the realization of that that set that men free. He never realized the difference between the fact and the consciousness of it. And it was when he came to realize the fact that his soul was set at liberty and he began to sing, and the whole world began to sing in the glorious Protestant doctrine. And here it is, again. I say that I am in Christ, my realization of it various but the fact is an absolute, it\u0026rsquo;s an eternal fact. that\u0026rsquo;s the argument of the apostle, then therefore all these things are of necessity true, just a second deduction therefore, I am never called upon in the scripture to crucify myself. Never.\n[24:26 no question marks here] The Scripture never calls upon me to crucify myself or to crucify the old men that is in me. But we all often don\u0026rsquo;t do that,\n[24:37][all we know is this is??] how this doctrine of the cross is often preached. People say Christ has been crucified for you. All that remains now is that you submit to be crucified yourself with him. And you heard it like that. That\u0026rsquo;s how it\u0026rsquo;s genuinely preached. Christ has been crucified for you. But now you have got to give yourself up to crucifixion with him, I say that that is totally and completely unscriptural. It is something that is never found in the Scripture at all. Because it\u0026rsquo;s something that you and I cannot do. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you something still more wonderful. If you\u0026rsquo;re a Christian, you have no need to do that for this good reason. It\u0026rsquo;s already happened. I have been crucified with Christ. I was crucified with Christ when He died on the cross on Calvary hill. It\u0026rsquo;s happened there. I\u0026rsquo;m not called upon to crucify myself because the thing has already taken place. When he died, I died with him, you are dead.\n[25:41]I literally(??) no longer I. That is it. I have been crucified with Christ. So my friends, let\u0026rsquo;s be careful. of that false devotional attitude towards the cross.\n[26:01]Which has ever been the bane(??) of pietism. It\u0026rsquo;s quite wrong. Yes, you are told to crucify the flesh, with its affections and its lust.\n[26:13]you were told to modify your members(it seems not a right word in the context??) which are on the earth, but what you\u0026rsquo;re never told to do is to crucify yourself. And if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to, you\u0026rsquo;re wasting your time, it\u0026rsquo;s you\u0026rsquo;ll never do it. And it\u0026rsquo;s quite unnecessary, I say the thing to do is to realize that it\u0026rsquo;s happened. Knowing this, listen to it again, knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him.\n[26:37 no question mark] It\u0026rsquo;s taken place on Calvary cross. So that I go on to my third conclusion, which is this. The old Adamic men that I once was, is dead, and is no longer in existence. Let me open that up just a little. Every one of us born into this world is born a child of Adam.\n[27:11]We inherited from him that old sinful nature, which is governed and controlled by sin and is opposite to God (the natural ??). The carnal mind is enmity against God is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. And we\u0026rsquo;re all born like that. We are all born God haters. We are all born rebels against God, every one of us without a single exception. Every child born into this world starts with a prejudice against God. We all dislike him and hate him. We wish he wasn\u0026rsquo;t there.\n[27:41]Ah, but you say that\u0026rsquo;s going to die(??). It\u0026rsquo;s true of every one of us. And it is only as we are taught and I\u0026rsquo;ve given to see him to know the truth that we get rid of it. It\u0026rsquo;s in everybody. That\u0026rsquo;s my old Adamic nature. But this is the glorious truth.\n[28:01]I\u0026rsquo;m no longer dead(??). My old that Adamic nature died with Christ upon the cross. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t only Christ there was dying there. My world men was done with him. He took on him human nature, he took on him our sins,\n[28:20]he was made sin(or sins ??) for us. And that is how it happened. We were dying with him, all for whom he came died with him there that he might give eternal life to them. So that we must say with the apostle here that our old man was / has been crucified with him, and he\u0026rsquo;s no longer here. Now I assert that and we must all assert that. And that\u0026rsquo;s the way to get rid of spiritual depression.\n[28:52]And that\u0026rsquo;s the way to put the devil to (flight ??) to say I am no longer a child of Adam. I am in Christ, that all the Adamic man has been dead with once and forever and can never come back. You see, it\u0026rsquo;s only when you say something like that, that people begin to think you\u0026rsquo;re preaching antinomianism. And it was because he said things like that people thought Paul was preaching antinomianism. it\u0026rsquo;s the charge that\u0026rsquo;s always been brought against this great doctrine of grace, but it\u0026rsquo;s inevitable. So I go on to another deduction to put it still more strongly. The law as a system set against me, and that condemns me is no longer there as far as I am concerned. Now you\u0026rsquo;ll notice what I say. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you and I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep the 10 commandments. I say that the law as a system set against me and under which I\u0026rsquo;m living and which is condemning me, as far as I am concerned as a Christian is no longer in existence. I am dead to the law and the law is dead to me. Because of Christ\u0026rsquo;s perfect work with respect to it. Let me hurry on to the next conclusion which puts all that positively. Listen to Paul saying it. There is therefore no more condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. Ah, but you say, how can that be true because I sin, and I\u0026rsquo;m conscious of sin and failure and I made unhappy about my sin. Does that mean that Paul was claiming sinless perfection? Of course he doesn\u0026rsquo;t. What Paul is saying is this, that I am no longer under condemnation. There is never no longer any condemnation for me for this reason, that the man named me that was under the law has died with Christ, I am no longer under the condemnation of the law. Of course, I feel condemned when I sin, but I go to God, and I confess it, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses me, I no longer under a scathing condemnation. That has been finished. I am out of the court, I\u0026rsquo;m a free man, the court has nothing more to do with me, I have passed from judgment to life. Those are scriptural statements. And you see, it is only as you and I take hold of these things and stand upon them, that we can enjoy the glorious liberty of the children of God, we must assert that there is no condemnation for us. That cannot be because the man in me that was under condemnation, has been dealt with and has died, has gone out of existence, he\u0026rsquo;s not there.\nSo I go on to say another thing, which is this. I no longer belong to the realm of sin. I no longer belong to the dominion of Satan. Sin shall not have dominion over you as Paul for you are not under the law, but under grace. How often does he say that sort of thing. You have been translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his dear son. He was given the commission by the risen Lord himself on the road to Damascus to preach that, teaching them he says and enlightening them, and turning them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God. The Christian is not under the dominion of Satan. He\u0026rsquo;s no longer under the power of Satan. He\u0026rsquo;s been conflicted out of that he\u0026rsquo;s been put into a new kingdom. and John there all say the same thing. You remember John, in that first epistle of his there right at the very end, says this mighty and magnificent thing. We know that whosoever is born of God, sins not, but he that is begotten of God keep us himself, and that wicked one touch with him not.\n[32:36]And we know that we are of God, and that the whole world laursen(??) the wicked one. we don\u0026rsquo;t, I no longer belong to the realm of sin nor to the dominion of Satan. And this isn\u0026rsquo;t boastfulness. This isn\u0026rsquo;t the kind of spiritual arrogance. This isn\u0026rsquo;t foolhardiness. This is Faith. I must say this, and it is only as I say this, that I can meet Satan, I turned to him and said, You can\u0026rsquo;t touch me,resist the devil and flee from. This is using the sword of the Spirit. This is having the shield of faith in our hand, this is taking unto me the whole armor of God and standing upon faith, and defying hell and the devil in the name of this Christ, to whom I belong. statement, I no longer belong to the world. But I don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to say that, thank God. I don\u0026rsquo;t belong to the world with its mind and its outlook and its power and all that it represents. I make my burst in the crust of the Lord Jesus Christ, by in which the world has been crucified unto me and I have been crucified unto the world. Don\u0026rsquo;t you want to say that don\u0026rsquo;t you rejoice in saying it? If the world is still do what it always has been, you\u0026rsquo;re not a Christian. By nature, we all belong to the world and we love it. And we like its things. By nature, we all kind of like the kind of life that\u0026rsquo;s depicted in the newspapers with its suppose at glamour, and its excitement and its thrill, and it\u0026rsquo;s wonder. A very good way of knowing whether you\u0026rsquo;re a Christian or not, is this: Is that the sort of thing that still appeals to you? You see when you become a Christian, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to argue about it. A shutter drops.\n[34:27] (You don\u0026rsquo;t allow you\u0026rsquo;re no longer hunters things ??). Some things happen to you can\u0026rsquo;t help yourself. They become distasteful. You see how small and trivial they are. You finish to them something in me was finished to them, quite right, you\u0026rsquo;re a new creature, is(??) the old men you see you belong to that is dead is not there. That\u0026rsquo;s the longer(??) the short of it. It\u0026rsquo;s a support and the proof of the apostle great argument.\nAre you still with me, my friends? Well, I wonder whether you can come still follow with me. Whether you know about the things that I\u0026rsquo;m about to become a heretic. listen, I\u0026rsquo;m going to say this to you. Listen carefully to me. If then I do that which I would not, I consent into the law that it is good. now that this is what I\u0026rsquo;m going to say. Now then it is no more I that do it. but sin that dwells in me. I\u0026rsquo;m going to say that I must say that if all I\u0026rsquo;ve said so far is true, this must be true. When I as a Christian sin, it is no longer on(??) you that I\u0026rsquo;m doing it. But it is sin that dwells in me. It\u0026rsquo;s my flesh. It\u0026rsquo;s this law that is in my members not in me. Is that heresy? Well, you notice I\u0026rsquo;m quoting Paul from the sense(??) of Romans, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dare say such a thing myself. But Paul says it and to make doubly certain he says it twice. There it is, in verse 17 of the Seventh Chapter. Now then it is no more I to it, but sin that dwells within me. Listen to verse 20. Now, if I do that, I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin the dwellers in me, who tries over because he knows what fearful creatures we are, and how lacking in faith we are, and how fearful we are. But he says, You must say it, if alive said is true, this must be true. what does it mean? Well, I think it means this. He\u0026rsquo;s already said it, you see in the second verse of the sixth chapter, how shall we that are dead to sin, who have already died to sin, live any longer therein? Now? I am dead dead to sin. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to argue since Paul said an absolute fact what happened to you, in Christ and with Christ on the cross means that, that you are dead to sin, that you are finished with it and [37:18] within(??). you yourself, Yes, but notice this. (Born myself ??) and dead to sin. What the apostle calls a body of sin remains in me. chapter(??) the six, knowing this, that (our lower men ??) has been crucified with Christ, in order that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin, a kind of body of sin remains in me, and that still has to be destroyed. I myself am dead to sin finished with it. But there is a kind of rarely(??) called remnant of sin left in me, this body of sin, this sin in my flesh, this sin within my members(??), you notice it puts it like this, I know that in me, then in brackets, that is in my flesh, dwell as no good thing. That\u0026rsquo;s the flesh, this body of sin. And that\u0026rsquo;s why the apostle look forward so much to the redemption of the body, you\u0026rsquo;ll see, he keeps on talking about this redemption of the body. Yes, this relic(??), this remnant, this body of sin remains in the body in the flesh, but not in me. And therefore it is no longer I had to (live with it ??) but sin that dwells in me. And that, therefore, according to his mighty argument is the relationship with a Christian to sin, and to living the Christian life. And it all arises from this doctrine of the cross. Yes, while we are left in this world, we will have this problem of the body of sin that remains, and the apostle tells us how to deal with it. And the essence of it is this there\u0026rsquo;s no time obviously, I\u0026rsquo;m simply giving you the essence of his argument is this. Verse 11, likewise, recken yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive under God. Now, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you persuade yourself as something that isn\u0026rsquo;t true. What it means is this, that you say to yourself, I am dead to sin. All these things are told me, yes. Anyway, because of these things are true of me. Am I going to allow myself to be subjected to this body of sin that remains me? Certainly not. I\u0026rsquo;m going to reject it. I\u0026rsquo;m going to repent, because I know these things. In other words, the way to fight this fight against the remnant, the body of sin that remains is to stand upon your doctrine, to say these things to yourself and to the devil and to every temptation. And then to go on to say what we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at next Sunday morning, about how having risen with Christ about the new life that\u0026rsquo;s in us, about his life in us, and about the Spirit that He gives us the power and all these things. But wait a minute, start with this doctrine. I have been crucified with Christ, I am no longer under condemnation nor can be. I am dead to sin, dead to the world. And because of that, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to be foolish enough to allow a thing like that to control me. Sin cannot have dominion over you. It can\u0026rsquo;t have it mustn\u0026rsquo;t have, it won\u0026rsquo;t have. And therefore I must yield my members(??) as instruments of unrighteousness into sin, but I must yield my members and myself as those who are alive from the dead unto righteousness, and unto God. Well, there it is very hurriedly, and I\u0026rsquo;m afraid inadequately. But my dear friend, if you\u0026rsquo;ve got this, you\u0026rsquo;ve got the fundamental postulate out of which you can deduce all the rest. When the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross on Calgary\u0026rsquo;s Hill, you were also being crucified with him. Your old Adamic man that you were dying, he is no longer in existence. Realize that thank God for that rejoice in it. And face every problem in life in death everywhere. In the light of that glorious knowledge, Stand fast therefore in the liberty where with Christ had set you free. (glory in it and in the cross ??), by which all this has been brought to pass.

How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? And I want to deal particularly with that second verse and the parallel similar complementary statements, which are found in this chapter, God forbid, how shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? Now the apostle who wrote this sixth chapter and the following chapters, in reply to that question that he puts forward in this first verse, What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, the grace may abound? It wasn’t that he himself thought of that question. But that he knew that many possibly in Rome, and certainly many elsewhere, were very definitely raising that question in the light of the apostles own teaching. And it’s a question that the natural mind will always raise. When it reads the kind of thing that the apostle says in the fifth chapter of this epistle to the Romans. There he had been working out his great doctrine of the imputation of the righteousness of Christ to the believer. It well rounded up in that magnificent statement of his, where sin abounded, grace did much more abound and at once the natural mind says, well, of course, if that’s so, if it’s true to say, in a sense that the more sin the bounds of grace knows much more abound, well, let us sin, the more we sin, the more grace will abound.\nSo grace becomes a wonderful cloak for sale Indeed, almost an encouragement to say, the apostle never knew that many did argue in that way, he was constantly being charged with teaching what is called antinomianism. That his gospel of grace was such as to give the impression that Law no longer counted in any sense at all, and that sin didn’t matter, that nothing mattered serve this wonderful grace of God that covered our sins in such an overwhelming manner.\nSurely, the apostle while a great teacher, as he was, anticipates this criticism, even from the church in Rome, and takes it up at once and deals with it. He rejects it with harm God forbid it. And then he goes on to say, however, not only is it unreasonable, and an utterly false deduction to draw from his teaching, but the furthermore, anybody who ever thinks like that, who speaks like that, is showing quite clearly that he’s never understood the doctrine. For the doctrine of Paul, truly understood, is a doctrine which teaches not only that grace does not incite one to sin. But that grace, in a sense makes it impossible for one to sin. And that ultimately, its grand purpose is to deliver us entirely from sin and all its consequences. Now, that is what the Apostle does.\nNow, I’m calling your attention to it all this morning. Not precisely in that way, but from a slightly different angle. It’s the same argument exactly. But we are going to deal with his argument not in reply to this theoretical question that he poses, but in a slightly more practical manner. We have been engaged for a number of Sunday mornings now with this problem, this question which we have described as spiritual depression. We are considering the case of the miserable Christian. The case of men and women who, while clearly Christian, are not happy in their Christian lives and they\u0026rsquo;re not enjoying their Christian lives. We are considering the case of those Christians whose lives seem to be bound in shallows and in miseries.\nAnd we’ve been considering some of the greatest causes of that and applying the remedy and the cure, which is provided for us in the New Testament scriptures. Now, we can refer to another cause of this depression.\nThis defeatism this unhappiness in the Christian life as it afflicts so many. And the particular one that obviously is dealt with here is depression, or disappointment or unhappiness in the Christian life, which arises from a sense of failure in living the Christian life. The sense of depression that arises because we tend to feel that we are being conquered by sin, rather than conquering sin. There are many people like that they’ve been Christians for years, and yet they are unhappy, and they’re always analyzing themselves and condemning themselves. And this is the cause they say, I don’t seem to be living this Christian life as it should be lived.\nI’m not getting this sense of victory and of conquest. They are aware of failure in the actual practical living of the Christian life, and particularly in this whole question of the conflict with sin and with evil, and with temptation. Now, that’s a very great subject, of course, and there are many causes for that failure, and many causes of that feeling. But we can be perfectly settled. That the main cause, the fundamental cause, of which all the other causes are but subsidiary manifestations. The central cause, is the thing that the apostle deals with in this chapter. And that is, I say, a failure to realize our true and full relationship to the death of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. And that is the thing that which I want to call your attention this morning. This is Palm Sunday.\nNow the apostle’s main concern here is to deliver knowing women from that appalling misunderstanding and incomplete understanding of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross. Very well I say that that raises a duty this profound question what exactly was happening there? What was it? What does it mean? What does it really say to us? God granted, we may take hold upon this. Not only that our thinking may be adequate during these coming days. But in order that we may enter into the glorious liberty of the children of God. It is only a true understanding of the cross that does that. And all sanctification comes out of the cross. The cross is central in all these matters, very well done.\nWhat is it? Well now then answer is this. The Apostle rarely has been giving the whole answer in the previous chapter. The fifth chapter, not the whole answer, but the basic consideration. It’s there starting at that 12 verse where we began to read in the fifth chapter and it runs right through this present sixth chapter, and indeed goes on also to the seventh. The writer understand what really happened on the cross on Calvary hill is to know something about the biblical doctrine of the covenant. The biblical doctrine of the covenant. I say you don’t begin to understand the cross until you understand the covenant. What do I mean by that? I mean this. The way to approach the cross is to understand the great covenant that was made between God the Father and God the Son before the very foundation of the world. The Covenant was there made between the Father and the Son, and it was this. God knew that man was going to sin, and going to fall in all the consequences of sin and the fall. And he made a covenant with his son, and he gave unto his son certain people out of humanity, who ought to be redeemed and rescued. And the Son came into the world to do that You remember how he puts it himself in his great high priestly prayer, that just under the very shadow of the cross, listen, as though has given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him. Read again, the 17th of John. It’s a great exposition of this idea of the covenant. God has given these people to the Son, and the Son came into the world to do something to redeem and to rescue those people. And furthermore, it goes on to say this that All these people are in union with the Lord Jesus Christ. They are all done to him. Now take this great working out of the argument in the fifth chapter of this epistle to the Romans, did you notice it? here is the argument, Paul keeps on saying that the relationship of Christians to the Lord Jesus Christ, is exactly the same, as was the relationship of the whole of mankind to Adam. You notice how he kept on saying it, as in Adam, so in Christ. He repeats that argument in the first epistle to the Corinthians and in the 15th chapter, but here it is, as by one man’s offense, so by one man’s obedience. Adam, Christ, it’s an exact parallel. And this is his argument. In Adam, he tells us, the whole human race fell, why? well for this reason that Adam was not only the head of the human race, he was also the representative of the human race. The whole of the human race was in Eden, moreover our God appointed Adam as the federal head and representative of the entire human race. So this is what happens. When Adam sinned and fell, the entire human race sin then fell with him. That’s the argument of the fifth Romans. Read it again for yourselves at leisure. He says well for us by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin. And so death passed upon all men for all have sinned, and they all sinned in Adam. It is his one transgression that did it. It’s no use saying that you don’t like that sort of statement. You either accept the scripture or you don’t. So it is no use saying, I think it’s unfair, my dear, my dear friend, are you putting your little mind against that of God and God’s gracious purpose. That is the teaching of the scripture, that we are all in Adam, and we’ve all fallen with Adam. And we’ve all derived the consequences of Adam’s sin, that is the doctrine of original sin and of original guilt. But, thank God for the but for a brings in the entire Gospel. Now comes the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And the statement and the argument is, that all who believe in Him now are in the same relationship to him, the Lord Jesus Christ, as they were before to Adam. with the Lord Jesus Christ, in a vital and in a mystical sense. The Father has given us to him, and we are joined to Him, He is in us and we are in Him, the union of the believer with Christ. It’s a great doctrine in the scripture, and I am suggesting this month, we cannot possibly understand the true meaning of the cross, unless we are clear about this doctrine of the covenant and of the mystical union of believers, with the Lord Jesus Christ.\nNow then what does it mean? It means this, all that happened to him, has also happened to us therefore. Adam sinned, because of the relationship, we sinned with Him. Christ has done certain things, because of the relationship that subsists between us, we have also done those things. That’s the argument of these two chapters. The Lord Jesus Christ, you say died on our behalf. Yes, perfectly true. But it is equally true to say this, that as he was doing it all, we were doing it in him and with him. That’s the proof. That’s the the case. So we are told a number of things in this chapter. And elsewhere in the scriptures, here are some. We are told that we were crucified with him. The apostle goes on saying that not only in this epistle, but in the epistle to the Galatians and elsewhere. I have been crucified with Christ. I was crucified with Christ he says. So on the cross and Calvary, it isn’t simply that the Son of God was being crucified. I was being crucified with him because I am in Him, I am bound to him. Not only that we’ve died with him. No, you’re not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death. We are baptized into him forget water baptism at that point, the important thing is that it means that we are incorporated into him. That is the way he describes the union. The means don’t matter at that point at all. The fact is that we are baptized into Christ. We have all says the apostle again in one Corinthians 12, verse 13, we have all been baptized by one spirit into this one body, the body of Christ, which is the church, that’s it. Now then there is the indissoluble union. And therefore he says, because of that we have died with him. Indeed, he goes further, we are buried with Him, we have been buried with him, by baptism unto death. You’ll see everything that’s happened to him has happened to us. That’s the inevitable conclusion which you must draw from this doctrine of the covenant and of the union. And then he goes on to say that we’re not only buried with him, but that we’ve also risen with him. Of course, we must, everything that happens to him has happened to us. If we are one with Him, nothing happens to him. But it happens to us also. So we are risen again. If he therefore be risen with Christ, He says, God willing, we are going to consider that next Sunday morning. And indeed, the apostle, you remember, goes even further, in the second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, in the fifth verse, where he actually says that we’ve not only been quickened with him, and raised with Him, but that we are seated with Him in the heavenly places. And we must be. If this doctrine of the union is correct, and it’s the whole teaching of the Scripture, everything that happens to him happens to us. So we are seated with Him in the heavenly places. Now then there, then I say, are the specific actual statements which are made here by the apostle. And his concern is to say that in the light of all this, this argument of let us continue in sin, that grace may be abandoned something that is utterly inconceivable. Indeed, it is impossible, it can’t happen. That we this morning are concerned in particular with this aspect of the crucifixion, and the death.\nWhat are we told about that? Well, there are certain statements again, which are made here and which the apostle makes elsewhere. And I must call your attention to them and first thing that he tells us, therefore that must be true of us, because of all that is this. We are dead to sin. That’s the second verse, God forbid, he says, How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer than now at this point The Authorized Version is not only poor and weak, but it’s misleading. This is one of those cases where the revised version is altogether superior. What it really is saying is that, God forbid, how shall we, that have died to sin, live any longer then. it isn’t our death, it’s something that happened once and for all, we have died to sin. That’s the apostle statement. He then goes on to show how we have died to sin, because of this human being baptized into him and effort into everything that happened to him. But here’s the result. We have died to sin. Every Christian is a person who has died to sin. Now, that’s not an argument. It’s a categorical statement. But again, he’s puts it like this in the sixth verse, knowing this, that our old men is crucified with Him, again takes a Revised Version. Our old men was crucified with Him. When was my old man crucified with him when he was crucified on the cross on Calvary’s hill. That’s the significance of the cross. My old men, my old nature, rouse has been crucified with Christ. It’s happened.\nThat’s the sixth verse of this sixth chapter of the epistle to the Romans. Then there are other statements which he deduces, and he puts them in this form. The result of all this is that we our Christians are dead to the law. We have died to the law. I’ll explain in a moment what that means. But the categorical fact is that we have died, we are dead to the law. And again, he puts it like this In Galatians, six in the 14th verse, God forbid that I should glory save in the cross, or my Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified unto me, and I have been crucified unto the world. I have been crucified unto the world, and the world has been crucified unto me. Those are his deductions. And finally, he has this astounding statement in the third chapter of the epistle to the Colossians in the third verse, you are dead, you are dead, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. Now, here surely, are the most momentous statements that can ever confront us while we are in this life. What’s it all mean? What’s it all about? What am I to say to myself in the light of all these things? Now, here are the deductions which I would put for your consideration. The first is this, that all these things are facts. They are not something that I am to regard as if they were facts. That isn’t what the apostle is saying. All this doctrine is a statement of fact, now , let me put it in as bold and as blunt and as challenging manner as I can, I’ll put it like this. I am as much in Christ at this moment as I shall ever be. You agree with it, I am as much in Christ now, as I shall be when I’m in the glory.\nIt is a fact. it is something that has happened. It is something that has been done by God. I have died with him. I have been buried with him. I have risen with him. I am seated with Him in the heavenly places. Now let’s be clear about this. My knowledge of that and my realization of that can grow and increase and develop and they should. But as to the fact itself, that can’t grow, that can’t develop. You’re either in Christ or you are not in Christ, you can’t be partly in them partly out, you can’t be going in and out. You are either in Christ forever, or you’re not in Christ. The thing itself is a fact. And you know half our troubles and half our depressions are due to this, that we confuse the fact and our consciousness of it. I was talking in this pulpit last Friday night about Martin Luther and the Reformation. And the doctrine of justification by faith only, you know, it was the realization of that that set that men free. He never realized the difference between the fact and the consciousness of it. And it was when he came to realize the fact that his soul was set at liberty and he began to sing, and the whole world began to sing in the glorious Protestant doctrine. And here it is, again. I say that I am in Christ, my realization of it varies but the fact is an absolute, it’s an eternal fact. that’s the argument of the apostle, then therefore all these things are of necessity true, here is the second deduction therefore, I am never called upon in the scripture to crucify myself. Never.\nThe Scripture never calls upon me to crucify myself or to crucify the old men that is me but we often don’t do that do we and how often is this doctrine of the cross preached. People say Christ has been crucified for you. All that remains now is that you submit to be crucified yourself with him. And haven’t you heard it like that. That’s how it’s genuinely preached. Christ has been crucified for you. But now you have got to give yourself up to crucifixion with him, I say that that is totally and completely unscriptural. It is something that is never found in the Scripture at all. Because it’s something that you and I cannot do. I’ll tell you something still more wonderful. If you’re a Christian, you have no need to do that for this good reason. It’s already happened. I have been crucified with Christ. I was crucified with Christ when He died on the cross on Calvary hill. It’s happened there. I’m not called upon to crucify myself because the thing has already taken place. When he died, I died with him, you are dead. I no longer am I. That is it. I have been crucified with Christ. So my friends, let’s be careful. of that false devotional attitude towards the cross. Which has ever been the bane of pietism. It’s quite wrong. Yes, you are told to crucify the flesh, with its affections and its lust. you were told to modify your members which are on the earth, but what you’re never told to do is to crucify yourself. And if you’re trying to, you’re wasting your time, it’s you’ll never do it. And it’s quite unnecessary, I say the thing to do is to realize that it’s happened. Knowing this, listen to it again, knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him.\nIt’s taken place on Calvary cross. So that I go on to my third conclusion, which is this. The old at Adamic man that I once was, is dead, and is no longer in existence. Let me open that up just a little. Every one of us born into this world is born a child of Adam. We inherited from him that old sinful nature, which is governed and controlled by sin and is opposed to God the natural The carnal mind is enmity against God is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. And we’re all born like that. We are all born God haters. We are all born rebels against God, every one of us without a single exception. Every child born into this world starts with a prejudice against God. We all dislike him and hate him. We wish he wasn’t there. But you say that’s going to die It’s true of every one of us. And it is only as we are taught and I’ve given to see him to know the truth that we get rid of it. It’s in everybody. That’s my old Adamic nature. But this is the glorious truth. I’m no longer that My old that Adamic nature died with Christ upon the cross. It wasn’t only Christ there was dying there. My world men was done with him. He took on him human nature, he took on him our sins, he was made sin for us. And that is how it happened. We were dying with him, all for whom he came died with him there that he might give eternal life to them. So that we must say with the apostle here that our old man was has been crucified with him, and he’s no longer here. Now I assert that and we must all assert that. And that’s the way to get rid of spiritual depression. And that’s the way to put the devil to death to say I am no longer a child of Adam. I am in Christ, that all Adamic man has been dead with once and forever and can never come back. You see, it’s only when you say something like that, that people begin to think you’re preaching antinomianism And it was because he said things like that people thought Paul was preaching antinomianism. it’s the charge that’s always been brought against this great doctrine of grace, but it’s inevitable. So I go on to another deduction to put it more strongly. The law as a system set against me, and that condemns me is no longer there as far as I am concerned. Now you’ll notice what I say. That doesn’t mean that you and I don’t have to keep the 10 commandments. I say that the law as a system set against me and under which I’m living and which is condemning me, as far as I am concerned as a Christian is no longer in existence. I am dead to the law and the law is dead to me. Because of Christ’s perfect work with respect to it.\nLet me hurry on to the next conclusion which puts all that positively. Listen to Paul saying it. There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. Ah, but you say, how can that be true because I sin, and I’m conscious of sin and failure and I made unhappy about my sin. Does that mean that Paul was claiming sinless perfection? Of course he doesn’t. What Paul is saying is this, that I am no longer under condemnation. There is never no longer any condemnation for me for this reason, that the man named me that was under the law has died with Christ, I am no longer under the condemnation of the law. Of course, I feel condemned when I sin, but I go to God, and I confess it, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses me, I no longer under a scathing condemnation. That has been finished. I am out of the court, I’m a free man, the court has nothing more to do with me, I have passed from judgment to life. Those are scriptural statements. And you see, it is only as you and I take hold of these things and stand upon them, that we can enjoy the glorious liberty of the children of God, we must assert that there is no condemnation for us. That cannot be because the man in me that was under condemnation, has been dealt with and has died, has gone out of existence, he’s not there.\nSo I go on to say another thing, which is this. I no longer belong to the realm of sin. I no longer belong to the dominion of Satan. Sin shall not have dominion over you as Paul for you are not under the law, but under grace. How often does he say that sort of thing. You have been translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his dear son. He was given the commission by the risen Lord himself on the road to Damascus to preach that, teaching them he says and enlightening them, and turning them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God. The Christian is not under the dominion of Satan. He’s no longer under the power of Satan. He’s been conflicted out of that he’s been put into a new kingdom. and John there all say the same thing. You remember John, in that first epistle of his there right at the very end, says this mighty and magnificent thing. We know that whosoever is born of God, sins not, but he that is begotten of God keep us himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. And we know that we are of God, and that the whole world laughs at the wicked one. we don’t, I no longer belong to the realm of sin nor to the dominion of Satan. And this isn’t boastfulness. This isn’t the kind of spiritual arrogance. This isn’t foolhardiness. This is Faith. I must say this, and it is only as I say this, that I can meet Satan, I turned to him and said, You can’t touch me,resist the devil and flee from. This is using the sword of the Spirit. This is having the shield of faith in our hand, this is taking unto me the whole armor of God and standing upon faith, and defying hell and the devil in the name of this Christ, to whom I belong. statement, I no longer belong to the world. But I don’t hesitate to say that, thank God. I don’t belong to the world with its mind and its outlook and its power and all that it represents. I make my burst in the trust of the Lord Jesus Christ, by in which the world has been crucified unto me and I have been crucified unto the world. Don’t you want to say that don’t you rejoice in saying it? If the world is still doing to you what it always has been, you’re not a Christian. By nature, we all belong to the world and we love it. And we like its things. By nature, we all kind of like the kind of life that’s depicted in the newspapers with its supposed glamour, and its excitement and its thrill, and it’s wonder. A very good way of knowing whether you’re a Christian or not, is this: Is that the sort of thing that still appeals to you? You see when you become a Christian, there’s no need to argue about it. A shutter drops. You no longer want those things Some things happen to you can’t help yourself. They become distasteful. You see how small and trivial they are. You finish to them something in me was finished to them, quite right, you’re a new creature, the old men you see you belong to that is dead is not there. That’s the long and the short of it. It’s a support and the proof of the apostle great argument.\nAre you still with me, my friends? Well, I wonder whether you can come still follow with me. Whether you know about the things that I’m about to become a heretic. listen, I’m going to say this to you. Listen carefully to me. If then I do that which I would not, I consent into the law that it is good. now that this is what I’m going to say. Now then it is no more I that do it. but sin that dwells in me. I’m going to say that I must say that if all I’ve said so far is true, this must be true. When I as a Christian sin, it is no longer I that am doing it. But it is sin that dwells in me. It’s my flesh. It’s this law that is in my members not in me. Is that heresy? Well, you notice I’m quoting Paul from the strength of Romans, I wouldn’t dare say such a thing myself. But Paul says it and to make doubly certain he says it twice. There it is, in verse 17 of the Seventh Chapter. Now then it is no more I to it, but sin that dwells within me. Listen to verse 20. Now, if I do that, I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin the dwellers th in me, who tries over because he knows what fearful creatures we are, and how lacking in faith we are, and how fearful we are. But he says, You must say it, if alive said is true, this must be true. what does it mean? Well, I think it means this. He’s already said it, you see in the second verse of the sixth chapter, how shall we that are dead to sin, who have already died to sin, live any longer therein? Now? I am dead dead to sin. There’s no need to argue since Paul said an absolute fact what happened to you, in Christ and with Christ on the cross means that, that you are dead to sin, that you are finished with it and with its realm but notice this you your self are dead to sin.\n[37:29]What the apostle calls a body of sin remains in me. chapter(??) the six, knowing this, that (our lower men ??) has been crucified with Christ, in order that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin, a kind of body of sin remains in me, and that still has to be destroyed. I myself am dead to sin finished with it. But there is a kind of relic called remnant of sin left in me, this body of sin, this sin in my flesh, this sin within my members you notice it puts it like this, I know that in me, then in brackets, that is in my flesh, dwell as no good thing. That’s the flesh, this body of sin. And that’s why the apostle look forward so much to the redemption of the body, you’ll see, he keeps on talking about this redemption of the body. Yes, this relic this remnant, this body of sin remains in the body in the flesh, but not in me. And therefore it is no longer I to live with it but sin that dwells in me. And that, therefore, according to his mighty argument is the relationship with a Christian to sin, and to living the Christian life. And it all arises from this doctrine of the cross. Yes, while we are left in this world, we will have this problem of the body of sin that remains, and the apostle tells us how to deal with it. And the essence of it is this there’s no time obviously, I’m simply giving you the essence of his argument is this. Verse 11, likewise, recken yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive under God. Now, that doesn’t mean that you persuade yourself as something that isn’t true. What it means is this, that you say to yourself, I am dead to sin. All these things are told me, yes. Anyway, because of these things are true of me. Am I going to allow myself to be subjected to this body of sin that remains me? Certainly not. I’m going to reject it. I’m going to repulse it , because I know these things. In other words, the way to fight this fight against the remnant, the body of sin that remains is to stand upon your doctrine, to say these things to yourself and to the devil and to every temptation. And then to go on to say what we’ll be looking at next Sunday morning, about how having risen with Christ about the new life that’s in us, about his life in us, and about the Spirit that He gives us the power and all these things. But wait a minute, start with this doctrine. I have been crucified with Christ, I am no longer under condemnation nor can be. I am dead to sin, dead to the world. And because of that, I’m not going to be foolish enough to allow a thing like that to control me. Sin cannot have dominion over you. It can’t have it mustn’t have, it won’t have. And therefore I must not yield my members as instruments of unrighteousness into sin, but I must yield my members and myself as those who are alive from the dead unto righteousness, and unto God. Well, there it is very hurriedly, and I’m afraid inadequately. But my dear friend, if you’ve got this, you’ve got the fundamental postulate out of which you can deduce all the rest. When the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross on Calgary’s Hill, you were also being crucified with him. Your old Adamic man that you were dying, he is no longer in existence. Realize that thank God for that rejoice in it. And face every problem in life in death everywhere. In the light of that glorious knowledge, Stand fast therefore in the liberty where with Christ had set you free. (glory in it and in the cross by which all this has been brought to pass. Amen!\n"},{"id":214,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/106_Romans/MJL-sermons/Romans_0614/","title":"Romans 6:4 - Spiritual Depression","section":"Martyne Lloyd-Jones - Romans","content":"The Book of Romans 罗马书\n(罗六14)\n \rI should like to call your attention this morning to the words which are to be found in Paul\u0026rsquo;s epistle to the Romans in the sixth chapter, nd in particular, perhaps the 14th verse, the 14th verse in the sixth chapter of Paul\u0026rsquo;s epistle to the Romans,\n For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.\n For sin shall not have dominion over you. For we are not under the law, but under grace. We will resume our consideration of a theme since the second Sunday morning of this present year, namely the theme of what we have described as spiritual depression. In other words, we are considering the case of large numbers of people. While the clearly and obviously Christians are not happy, they can almost be described as miserable Christian. And we are considering this theme as they have been indicating repeatedly, not merely because it\u0026rsquo;s tragic to think that there should be any Christians in such a condition. But still more because of the failure of such people, to witness to the faith and the glory of the faith, especially at a time like this. When the world outside the church is so bankrupt, and is looking feverishly and helplessly for comfort and consolation, and for light. So we\u0026rsquo;re looking at it for those reasons, it is actually something quite incongruous, the very terms of the contradiction in and of themselves, miserable Christian, depressed Christian, spiritual depression. The thing is intolerable, and therefore, we must deal with it. And we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing so by considering the various causes of this condition. It can arise from many different causes, and each one has its appropriate remedy and treatment. It\u0026rsquo;s all found in the Scriptures. And that is why Christians must live on the scriptures and by the scriptures. If a man doesn\u0026rsquo;t live in the scriptures, well, he is bound to be depressed, he is bound to fail, he is bound to be miserable. We can\u0026rsquo;t live without it. It\u0026rsquo;s our food. We know nothing approximate. And as I\u0026rsquo;ve been finding out on many of these Sunday mornings, there is a sense in which it can almost be said that finally, the one great cause of spiritual depression is ignorance of the Scripture. And here again, we shall find that illustrated as we come back to a consideration of this great sixth chapter of the epistle to the Romans. The particular cause of spiritual depression, which is dealt with here is a sense of the failure and the frustration that often arises in the life of the Christian because of the problem of sin. I\u0026rsquo;m sure that all ministers and pastors would agree with me when I say that probably nothing brings people to us more frequently then some problem connected somehow or another with failure in the living of the Christian life. So I\u0026rsquo;m falling into sin, some sin that Harris\u0026rsquo;s and bothers and gets this individual down constantly, in spite of all efforts and endeavors, the problem of sin. Some particular sin or perhaps a number of now, that is the problem that is rarely dealt with in this great chapter. The Apostle takes it up, of course, in its context. He is interested primarily in the way that certain people misunderstand the doctrine of grace. And because he has said at the end of the previous chapter where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. Some are tempted to say well, very well if that is really discontinuing sin that grace may abound. And he is out to ridicule any such suggestion and to show how it displays a complete failure to understand the very basis of the Christians position. But in doing that, incidentally, he does show us in the most amazing men are the way in which the Christian does have victory over sin. Sanctification in the epistle to the Romans does not start in chapter eight, but in chapter six. And there\u0026rsquo;s no need to wait until we get on to chapter eight. It\u0026rsquo;s all in chapter six. And I want to try to show you again this morning how the apostle folds to us and shows us this way of true victory. Even while we\u0026rsquo;re in this life and in this world. Now, we\u0026rsquo;ve already looked at this chapter twice. But I come back to it again, because I want if I may, to gather up what I said on the two previous occasions and to apply it because the apostle himself does that very thing very well, and let us put it like this. The key to the understanding of this chapter, as it is, indeed, the key to the understanding of the entire Christian life is the doctrine of the union of the Christian when the Lord Jesus Christ. That\u0026rsquo;s the key. He is, he is unfolded that in the previous chapter, chapter five, where his whole argument, you\u0026rsquo;ll remember has been this, that by nature, by birth, we are all in Adam. Adam was the head of the human race. He was the federal head and representative, but more than that, the entire human race was in Adam, if you like in the lines of Adam. So that when Adam fell, we all fell. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s the teaching of the Scripture. And my dear friends, it\u0026rsquo;s no use distributing the Bible throughout the world if you deny its doctrines, that\u0026rsquo;s what the Scripture teaches. That all men are in Adam, and that when Adam fell, the whole of mankind fell, and became guilty in it, and inherited all the consequences of his sin and of his fall. So we are all born in sin with Adam. But and this is the glory of the gospel. It is equally true to say of all who are Christians and to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they are in Christ. That the relationship which they bear to him is exactly parallel with the relationship that all mankind by nature best weather(??). As we read(??) in Christ in Adam(??) So are we in Christ, as in Adam, all men die. So in Christ, shall all men be made alive and so on. Now, that is absolutely fundamental. And you notice the apostle goes on repeating it in this sixth chapter. No way(??), not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death. Yes, but we\u0026rsquo;ve been baptized into him. We are in Him. And what he unfolds in this chapter, you\u0026rsquo;ll remember is how everything that is true him(??) is true of us. All that he has done, we have done it because we are in it. Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve dealt with that I say on two previous occasions in this way. The first argument was that we have died with Christ. We\u0026rsquo;ve been baptized into his death, and when the Lord Jesus Christ was dying on that cross on Calvary, all believe in Him were dying with him. Now we\u0026rsquo;ve worked that out in detail, because it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely vital. We were crucified with Him, we died with Him, we were buried with Him, we\u0026rsquo;ve risen with him, we are seated at the right hand of God in the heavenly places with Him and in Him. The results of all this we have seen is that we are dead to sin, dead to the law. But not only that, we went on Easter Sunday morning to point out this other conclusion. That as it is true to say that we died with him, it is equally true to say that we have risen with Him obviously. If we are in Him, everything that he has done, we have done. So we are risen with Christ. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him which means that we are living with him. We no longer belong to the realm of the dead. You remember how he puts it there in the 13th verse,\n Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead\u0026hellip;.\n We\u0026rsquo;ve risen with Christ. And we remembered how the apostle in the third chapter of the epistle to the Colossians puts it in one of the boldest things he ever said in his life. When he said he are(??) dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. That\u0026rsquo;s where you are. Now. That is his greatest arguments so far, in Christ joined indissolubly mystically to him. These things are true of us. And we\u0026rsquo;ve been emphasizing the fact. That\u0026rsquo;s the whole purpose of the chapter, to state the fact we have died, we have risen, and so on. But now if we are truly, to be living the Christian life and to be experiencing its blessings, and especially to be enjoying its victories. We must apply all this. And the apostles does the application follows. And you want particularly particularly, therefore, to consider the verses in the chapter this morning in which he does the application. The important one in a sense is verse 11. Listen, Likewise, now, that\u0026rsquo;s it,\n Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ……\n That\u0026rsquo;s the application. And there are other parts of the application also. But let me try to summarize the whole teaching for you under a number of propositions. The first is this, that if we want to live in to enjoy the Christian life, and above all, I say that to live it victoriously. The first thing we have to do is to realize the truth about ourselves in Christ. Now, the way of victory in the Christian life is not primarily just to be praying and to be looking to Christ. The first thing we have to do is to realize the truth about ourselves in Christ. That\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of this, this chapter. And again, I must point out how so much holiness teaching completely ignores this sixth chapter of Romans. It depreciates it, it says, all we must hurry on to the eighth chapter with the Holy Spirit is first mentioned, as if there\u0026rsquo;s no victory in chapter six, but it\u0026rsquo;s all here my friends. And so you\u0026rsquo;ll see our theories can often depreciate scripture. And we must always test our every theory by the test of Scripture itself. And here is the apostles method. reckon he says, reckon yourselves likewise, therefore you\u0026rsquo;ll notice the inevitability of it(??). But what does this term reckon rarely mean? Well, you can translate it, if you like, like this, it can be read, regard yourselves therefore, or in the same way, regard yourselves as those that are dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God in Jesus Christ. Or if you prefer another phrase, acount yourself, account yourself. That\u0026rsquo;s it, you compute you account, you regard yourself in this way. Oh, yes, but the vital question is what is even that mean? Now here, I must be careful to point out that he does not mean that you just act as if this works. Now there are some have interpreted this verse in that way. This, of course, you\u0026rsquo;re not really dead on to sin. But you\u0026rsquo;re you\u0026rsquo;re if you want victory, you\u0026rsquo;re to act and live in such a way as if you were dead on to the sin. And it isn\u0026rsquo;t true of course, but you act as if it were, and as you go on acting as if it were, it will become, oh, that\u0026rsquo;s not scripture. That\u0026rsquo;s psychology. That\u0026rsquo;s cool, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? You are no better but you say every day and in every way, I am getting better and better. And the theory is that as you say that you actually will be getting better. You\u0026rsquo;re trying to persuade yourself for something that isn\u0026rsquo;t rarely, but it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing to do. It\u0026rsquo;s encouraging, it\u0026rsquo;s stimulating, and as you do that, you\u0026rsquo;ll feel better. It isn\u0026rsquo;t that. That isn\u0026rsquo;t what he said. The Apostle doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell us here to act as if this were true. His appeal is this, realize that it\u0026rsquo;s true. how different it is true. I\u0026rsquo;m not persuading myself about something that isn\u0026rsquo;t true. I am to realize that it is true. I am to grasp it, lay hold upon it, and truly to realize it in my constant thinking as well as in my living. In other words, there is no element of make belief in this. There is no element even a persuasion about it. It isn\u0026rsquo;t something I have to persuade myself about. I am simply to believe the categorical statements of the Scripture. That because I am in Christ, I have died with Christ. These old men I once was by nature gone, he is dead, he is finished. He is no longer in existence. Well, the apostle has been saying that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been knowing this that our old men was crucified with Him. Ah, yes, but they say crucifixion is a very slow process. And it\u0026rsquo;s quite true to say that the old man has been crucified, but he is still there. It\u0026rsquo;s a very, it takes a very long time to die from crucifixion. My friend, be careful what you\u0026rsquo;re saying. If that is true of the old man is equally true of Christ and He is no longer he is not yet dead. The Apostle statement is this that everything that has happened to Christ has happened to me. My old man is not undergoing a lingering process of dying, he is dead. He\u0026rsquo;s as dead as Christ is dead. In that physical sense. He\u0026rsquo;s gone. The thing has happened. Now, I pointed out on Easter Sunday morning, oh, the apostle is at great pains to emphasize this in verses 9 and 10. Listen,\n knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.\nFor in that he died, he died unto sin once\u0026hellip;\n which means once and for all,\n but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.\n Isn\u0026rsquo;t this argument Christ has finished with death. He\u0026rsquo;s finished with dying, he has died. He\u0026rsquo;s completed the act once and for all. Then verse 11,\n Likewise, reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin.\n Can anything be stronger? It isn\u0026rsquo;t a lingering process, it\u0026rsquo;s finished with as it\u0026rsquo;s finished within the case of Christ, likewise, understand, realize, regard yourselves as those who have finished with this. You when it\u0026rsquo;s finished in Christ, you yourselves have died with him. When other than that I say is the thing that we started. We are to realize that we died with Christ. We are to regard ourselves as those therefore who have risen with him that Christ is now our life. I live yet not I but Christ lives in me. That\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s what he means by reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Now that as I understand this teaching is the key to it all. And if we\u0026rsquo;re not clear about that, well, I say it again, at the risk of being misunderstood. If you don\u0026rsquo;t realize that and implemented, all you\u0026rsquo;re praying about your sin will probably not help you.\nAnd you can go the round of meetings seeking for some experience and you won\u0026rsquo;t get it, you may get a psychological experience. You may feel better in certain respects, because there are people who can testify to having had marvelous deliverance from particular things that worries them or not Christians at all. Psychology can do that. I remember the very dramatic case once of a man who had been a terrible drunkard. He\u0026rsquo;d signed pledges, he\u0026rsquo;d listened to appeals from his wife and children. He\u0026rsquo;d read books on the subject, he\u0026rsquo;d have given many things as it were to give it up, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t. that on one occasion, he had been guilty of terrible debauchery, and spent a very terrible day and night. That last he\u0026rsquo;d gone home and had gone to sleep. And in the morning, he got up and was dressing and having to look at himself in the mirror and was so horrified and shocked at what he saw that it came with such psychological power to him, that he literally never drank again. Now that sort of thing can happen. So let us be careful, as we preach experiences rather than the teaching of the Scripture. You don\u0026rsquo;t sound your doctrine on experiences. It\u0026rsquo;s the doctrine that should lead to the experience. Very well. I say this is basic and fundamental. What the apostle tells a man who\u0026rsquo;s being troubled and helpless by sin is not just simply to surrender it and to wait for victory. He says, wrecking yourself to be dead indeed on and you\u0026rsquo;ve got to do it. Nobody can do this reckoning for you. It isn\u0026rsquo;t a state of passivity. You and I have literally got to do this to ourselves and with ourselves, constantly, day by day. It\u0026rsquo;s the apostles teaching. It\u0026rsquo;s the inspired Word of God. So that I say the first step is to realize this great teaching about the union of the believer with Christ and to work out its implications. It\u0026rsquo;s a absolutely central and vital. But let me come on to the second part. The second thing in the light of all that, obviously is to be clear in our minds as to where sin comes in therefore, if that is the position of the Christian that is dead, the old man is finished with and he is now alive with Christ with his life, where the sin come into such a life. Well, the answer is this. Sin comes in, in what the Apostle calls our mortal body. In the sixth verse, he puts it like this knowing that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed. It hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet been destroyed. The old man has died in order that this body of sin might be destroyed. And then you see, you\u0026rsquo;ll get it again, in the 12th verse in the appeal, let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t say Let not sin reign in you. He says, Let not sin reign in your mortal body. That\u0026rsquo;s Listen, the body still is not ready. That is why the apostle you remember in the 23rd verse of the eighth chapter puts this. He says that the whole creation groaners and prevailed in pain together until now, and not only they, but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the Spirit. even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting, waiting for what? Waiting for the adoption. What\u0026rsquo;s that, to wit, the redemption of our body. Sin is still here, in the organization of our body, our mortal body, our flesh, the old man has gone Yes, but sin is still here, in my body in my physical being, which includes the mental, my mind and my understanding, as well as my physical processes, my instincts and all these things, sin is still there, in this mortal body. And you remember how the apostle had put it so clearly in the seventh chapter also? Here it is again. Now then he says it is no more either to it, but sin that dwells in me, and we repeat it. Now, if I do that, I would not it is no more either to it, but sin that well as in this sin in the mortal body. That it seems to me again, is another most important principle to grasp. Because you\u0026rsquo;ll see again, we can so easily go astray at that point. There are some who claim a kind of perfection. They say that sin has been taking right out of them altogether. They\u0026rsquo;ve got a clean heart, there\u0026rsquo;s no sin in them at all. They\u0026rsquo;ve been entirely cleansed from sin. Clearly, the apostle Paul didn\u0026rsquo;t believe that he didn\u0026rsquo;t claim that he didn\u0026rsquo;t teach them. For the good reason, as I shall show you later on that he exhorts Christians to Mortify therefore, if he live after the flesh, she shall die, but if he through the Spirit to modify the deeds of the body, and in the First Corinthians, the ninth chapter, he again tells us that he has to keep under his body. Sin is there. So that the teaching is not that we are entirely delivered and emancipated from sin in this life, not at all, I in a spiritual sense am but sin remains in my mortal body in my flesh. But what a vital distinction it is to know that I myself, am free. The old men has gone, but sin just remains in that way. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it like this, isn\u0026rsquo;t it like the children of Israel? You will remember they were taken out to the bondage and the servitude in the captivity of Egypt. They were no longer in Egypt. They were in Canaan, yes, but they got problems in Canaan. The nations were left in canon and they were worrying them as pricks and in their eyes and thorns in their sides. They were no longer in bondage in Egypt, they are in Canaan, yes, but they\u0026rsquo;ve got this fight to wedge even in Canaan. It\u0026rsquo;s something like that, there is a residue or remnants that remain. On the other hand, let us be careful to understand this. That\u0026rsquo;s a Christian is not one who goes through this life of mourning and defeated and grumbling. Now there have been Christian people who put it like that, the you know, pursuing the perfectionist, and those who talk about an entirely cleansed heart. They have not given the impression that the Christian in this life and in this world has a very weary defeated life, that he\u0026rsquo;s always going down and he\u0026rsquo;s always defeated. they misinterpret the seventh of Romans. I mustn\u0026rsquo;t go after that this morning. But I say The distinction is this. That sin is in my mortal body. Not in me as such. I mean by me the spiritual man. Well, very well, if that\u0026rsquo;s the second proposition, this leads me to the third, and this is the most glorious of all. We have to realize the certainty of our victory. Listen. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s the 14th. Listen to it again, for sin, SHA shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law, but under grace. Now, that is, again, a categorical and an absolute state. And yet, you know, people are afraid of it. I was reading a commentator on this only this last week, and he having gone almost entirely with me so far as I\u0026rsquo;ve spoken healer to suddenly becomes frightened at this point, he puts it like this. He says, this means this, that as we put into practice, verses 12, and 13, which tells us, let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that he should obey it, neither yield your members as instruments unto sin, but yield them unto God, and your instruments and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. He says, As you do that, sin shall not have dominion over. For which if I had been talking to him, I would have said, thank you very much. And thank you for nothing. It\u0026rsquo;s simply tautology. So if it means that it simply means this, that as I refrained from sin, sin shall not have dominion over me. But what comfort is there in that? Yes, the apostle wrote these words in order to give us the greatest comfort that we can ever have. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t say that as he went, I do certain things that sin shall not have dominion. He says, for its introduced by four, which means this, not that it\u0026rsquo;s a result of something that has gone before, it is the reason for the thing that has gone before. And therefore I say it is a categorical and a positive statement. It is an assertion. And what he tells us is this, that you and I as Christians are not engaged in a hopeless fight against sin. We are assured of victory at the very beginning. sin shall not have dominion over you. It\u0026rsquo;s an assertion. It\u0026rsquo;s a proclamation. Our victory as Christians of our sin is absolutely certain. It\u0026rsquo;s absolutely vital. Now listen to it. We are saying it in that first team universe which says this praise the Lord, for his glorious, never shall his promise fail. God has made his saints victorious, sin and death shall not prevail. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s something to be certain of. And the Christian, according to the apostle Uriel should now in the present, be absolutely certain of his victory of a sin and his victory therefore over them, they shall not, they will not be allowed to prevent. Well, now then why is this? Why is this victory of a certain why is it that we can say and should say that sin shall not have dominion over us, while he gives us the reason for he are not under the law, but under grace? What do you mean by this? Well, let us work it out. See, sin shall not have dominion over the Christian because he is not under law. What does that mean? Well, it means this that while we are under law, we are under the power and under the dominion of sin. Why is that? Well, the apostle answers that question in the Great 15 Chapter, the first Epistle to the Corinthians where he says that the sting of death is sin. And sin is the law. The law is the strength of sin. So that while we are under the law, we are under the strength and the power and the domination of sin. How does that come about? Well, it is the function of the law, to define sin, to search it out and to convict us of it. And that is why the sin the law is always something which is under conduct and into condemnation. it discovers us and it exposes us hidden masks. It holds us false in the court, and it brings its accusations against us. We are under its Dominion in that sense. But another way in which it is true is this. That while I\u0026rsquo;m under the law, I am left to my own strength only. The Lord examines me, it condemns me, it defines sin. He tells me what I ought to be and what I ought to do, but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t help me to do it. So that\u0026rsquo;s why the apostle in the next chapter you see in the third verse says, For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, weak through your flesh and nine, it says, there\u0026rsquo;s the test, go on and do it. But I can\u0026rsquo;t do it. I haven\u0026rsquo;t the strength I haven\u0026rsquo;t the power. I haven\u0026rsquo;t the vigor. So the more the law comes to me and indicates what I ought to be, the more as it were, it puts me under the dominion and under the power of sin. But indeed, the apostle goes further than that. It says, he says this. That law, that the law because of sin in me, actually stimulates sin with him. He puts it like this. What shall we say then is the law of sin? God forbid. Nay, I have not known sin, but by the law, for I have not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, rockin me, all men are concupiscence. For without the law of sin was dead, but for I was alive without the law once, but when the Commandment came, sinned revived, and I died. And the commandment which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death, for sin, taking occasion by the commandment deceived me. And by it flew me wherever the law is holy, and the commandment wholly unjust and good. But the trouble, as he goes on to say, is in myself, sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good, that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful. Now, the essence of that is this. Because we are sinful because of our fallen nature with ever, which we\u0026rsquo;ve inherited from him. The very law that comes to us and tells us not to do certain things, and to do others has the effect of encouraging us to do wrong. Well, her we\u0026rsquo;re like this. Sometimes by telling children and young people not to do certain things, you\u0026rsquo;re introducing them to those very things? Oh, yes. In your moral teaching, you\u0026rsquo;re telling them about the horrors of these things, the terrible results which they lead to? Yes, but concupiscence is within desire and lust. And it takes hold of this. It says, this is interesting. Oh, that must be pleasurable. Why do men do it? And they begin to think about it and declutter. But in the end by doing it, if you hadn\u0026rsquo;t told them not to do it, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have heard of it, and they\u0026rsquo;d never have done it. That\u0026rsquo;s what he\u0026rsquo;s saying. And isn\u0026rsquo;t it true against temptation? Be very careful, my friend, I suggest to you that as you read that book, you will find your very lusts and passions stimulated. With your mind, you\u0026rsquo;ll be trying to say I want to avoid this, but something else within you will be gloating over it. And you\u0026rsquo;ll like all the details. Or as I\u0026rsquo;ve often said, again, from this pulpit. That\u0026rsquo;s why people delight in reading all these details about divorce cases and murders and things like that, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? There\u0026rsquo;s something in it that appeals to us. So that the very law of God which is good and holy, which condemn sin, has the effect of inciting authenticity. So that as long as we\u0026rsquo;re only under the law, sin will have dominion over us. And to the pure, all things are pure us, but we are not pure. And therefore the things that are pure become defiled, to us, we twist them, we pervert. And therefore it is important to realize that while we are under law, we are always under the dominion and the control of sin. law does not deliver. It was never meant to deliver. And moral teaching will never solve the moral problem. It can\u0026rsquo;t do it, because man\u0026rsquo;s nature is wrong. In that condition, therefore, there is no freedom from the tyranny and the power of sin, which we have inherited from Adam. Therefore he says, sin shall not have dominion over you. Why? Because you will no longer under law. But let\u0026rsquo;s put it positively. We shall not be under the dominion of sin because we are on Hold on Grace. What do you mean by that? Well, it means this. We are in an entirely different position. And we are in an entirely different condition. The Christian is no longer vainly trying to make himself a better men by applying law and by trying to conform to the law. He\u0026rsquo;s finished with that he\u0026rsquo;s not under law, he\u0026rsquo;s under grace. What\u0026rsquo;s that mean? Well, it means he\u0026rsquo;s rejoicing in God\u0026rsquo;s free favor. He has heard and he has believed the gospel, which tells him that in spite of his failure and his sin, God has forgiven him, that God sent His Son into the world made him out of a woman and under the law, that he might redeem them that are under the law. He has heard and believed the marvelous proclamation, that his guilt has been expiated that Christ has died for it, and burn its penalty, and that God has forgiven it. Not only that, that God has given him the righteousness of Christ, indeed, that he\u0026rsquo;s in Christ. So his whole attitude is different. He\u0026rsquo;s no longer trying to make himself something. He\u0026rsquo;s been made something. He has received it as a gift from God. He\u0026rsquo;s been given it freely without doing anything at all in his sins. God justifies the ungodly. So he\u0026rsquo;s dead to the law finished with the law. But he\u0026rsquo;s risen with Christ. He\u0026rsquo;s got a new nature. He\u0026rsquo;s got new desires. The Law of God is no longer outside, and it\u0026rsquo;s written in his mind and imprinted in his heart. He wants to do it is no longer against the grain. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer grievous. It\u0026rsquo;s the very thing he desires. He loves it, he wants it. Yes, but even more than that, he\u0026rsquo;s a child of God. God has adopted him into his family. He\u0026rsquo;s been giving this dude he\u0026rsquo;s become a partaker, of this divine nature. Indeed, we can go further we can say this. And this is the way I think the apostle really meant it chiefly. Because all that I\u0026rsquo;ve just been saying is true of him. He knows that he is one whom God himself is bringing unto glory. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s not my statement, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that put in those very words, in the second chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in a most remarkable statement, in the 10th, verse, listen, for it became him from whom are all things, and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation, perfect through suffering. That\u0026rsquo;s the teaching. And it\u0026rsquo;s the teaching. God is bringing his sons unto glory. He\u0026rsquo;s chosen us, he\u0026rsquo;s elected us. He set us apart, he sanctified us by the Spirit, put us there in that position for himself. And what\u0026rsquo;s he doing? He is bringing us unto glory. I know of nothing more comforting and consoling than that. And that is why you sin shall not have dominion over us. Because God is bringing us into glory. He has put His Spirit into us and the Spirit is working within us. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that work within you. This is being under grace, you see, the new principle, the new power, the working of God. Not only that, I can see this here, which has begun the good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. If you\u0026rsquo;re a child of God, God has started to work in you, and he\u0026rsquo;s going on with it until you\u0026rsquo;re ultimately in glory. sin shall not have dominion over you. Because you\u0026rsquo;re in God\u0026rsquo;s purpose, and because His purpose is to bring you to glory. Do you know it means this? Because you\u0026rsquo;re God\u0026rsquo;s child, and because it is his purpose to bring you to glory. If you don\u0026rsquo;t respond to His gospel in its appeal, he\u0026rsquo;ll just fire you. That\u0026rsquo;s the argument again of 12. Hebrews, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? The Lord chestnuts who may love us, He scourges every tsunami is cold. And if you want all your Christians and we\u0026rsquo;re not obeying God, and the leading of the Spirit, don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if God chastises you. You may lose your money, you may lose your business, you may fail in your profession, you may lose your health, your wife may lose it your children may be taken from you, my friend, if you\u0026rsquo;re in the hands of God, be careful. He will bring you to perfection. Since shall not have dominion over you, even if it means test ism I go even a step further. We are going to be meeting in a few moments at the communion table. And when we meet, we read together what Paul said to the Corinthians, in the first epistle and in the 11th chapter. And you\u0026rsquo;ll remember it, let me read it to you, let\u0026rsquo;s some of you may not stay for the communion. Let a man who says examine himself. And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh, unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord\u0026rsquo;s body for this cause. Many are weakened, sickly among you, and many sleep, which means many of dead for this cause, because they didn\u0026rsquo;t examine themselves. They didn\u0026rsquo;t realize what they were doing when they came there. They didn\u0026rsquo;t realize the relationship to God in Christ. And because of that, many of them were weak, and some of them were ill and sick and laid aside. And somebody he died. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they were lost. No. But it means that God because they were history of them was chastising them. sin shall not have dominion over you. It\u0026rsquo;s uncertain as that. And in other words, we must emphasize this note of absolute certainty and assurance which is in the world. The apostle is simply saying here I say categorically that because we are joined to Christ, we are certainly inevitably going to be delivered entirely from sin. And that is why we should wait for the adoption to with the redemption of our body. Now there it is, the way in which we fight the problem, and the Battle of sin. It should fill us with joy and with assurance and with absolute certainty, and the God of the Lord is Ever our strength very well to conclude. In the light of all this, there is this final exhortation Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body. argue without refusing, say, secondly, yield not your members as instruments of unrighteousness under sin, positively, yield the ourselves under God as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness under God. And in turn, notify through the Spirit, the deeds of the body, notify your members which are on the earth. In other words, realizing the position, realizing especially this truth, that God is bringing you unto glory, and that the victory of a sin is absolutely certain and assured that nothing can prevent it and nothing can separate you from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord, therefore, don\u0026rsquo;t heal to sin. Don\u0026rsquo;t let his rule even in your mortal body, mortified your body, and the deeds of the body modifies the members of your body that are still on us. but yield yourselves and every member of your body, every faculty and interest that you possess, and tirely unto God and unto righteousness. And so you will actually experience increasing victory over sin in every form, and in every guy\u0026rsquo;s even while you are in this life. And in this one, that\u0026rsquo;s the position and I say as a close, that this is true victory based upon the truth and upon the doctrine, that I am in Christ. Head with him risen with him. Yes, there may have called the earth also justified and do me have justified them he has also lorries I am realizing this. I face sin in a new way. I say it shall not have dominion And I mustn\u0026rsquo;t allow it. I won\u0026rsquo;t allow you to reign in my mortal body, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t belong to me. It\u0026rsquo;s another realm, I am dead to them. And therefore, I must not yield to it or make any concession to it. And as I say that and as I act in that way, I know that the Spirit of God is the whole time working in me, both to will and to do that very thing. And so, my victory is assured, I am no longer despondent. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer a hopeless struggle. I know that I am in Christ, and that eventually my body even shall be delivered. And that I shall be complete and entire without spot or blemish, or fault or wrinkle or any such thing. complete, perfect in Christ in the presence of that.\n"},{"id":215,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/106_Romans/MJL-sermons/Romans_08_28-30/","title":"Romans 8:28-30","section":"Martyne Lloyd-Jones - Romans","content":"The Book of Romans 罗马书\n \rI would like to call your attention this evening to the words found in Paul\u0026rsquo;s epistle to the Romans in Chapter 8 reading verses 28, 29 and 30. from verse 28 to verse 30 in the 8th chapter of Paul\u0026rsquo;s Epistle to the Romans.\n28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.\n29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.\n30 Moreover, whom he did predestinate, then he also called, and whom he called them he also justified, and whom he justified them he also glorified.\n\rNow here we come again to another subsection. In this marvelous progression of arguments and subsections, which the great Apostle works out in this wonderful 8th chapter of this epistle to the Romans we have seen, we saw at the very beginning how it is divided into these various sections of, if you like, subsections. Only one great theme, which he puts in different ways, marshals. Different arguments and provides us with the different reasons for having a full assurance and an absolute certainty of our ultimate, final, complete salvation and deliverance from everything that sin has ever done to us. Now that's the controlling theme of the whole chapter, and here I say we move on now. To another form of this one great argument. The fact that we are moving on is introduced by the word end, and this I think serves 2 main functions here. It first of all links it with the main argument, as I say of the whole chapter. In other words, he's in effect saying, well, another or an additional reason for this is the one I'm about to put to you. It's another chain in this great link which is being forged in order to give us this final and ultimate assurance. I think that's probably the main connection. But of course it has a subsidiary connection as secondary and the second connection also and that is that it is. In a sense a continuation of what he has just been saying in the immediately preceding section, which we've been considering recently, about the spirit helping our infirmities and making intercession for us with groaning which cannot be uttered. There is no doubt but that this new statement does still have that in mind. But I'm here to argue that. The main connection is with the series of arguments, which he's been developing and deploying right through the whole chapter. I make that point because we find that a distinguished commentator like Doctor Charles Hodge would link this 28th verse solely with the previous. Statement with the previous paragraph. It's interesting that he puts this verse in with the other verses in his subdivision of this chapter. It's always a bold thing to disagree with him, but I feel that one has to do so that there's something beyond that. It's certainly, as I say, has its connection, its relationship to that. But there's much more than that here, the very last phrase in this 28th verse. It takes us to something altogether bigger and higher, and that is to them who are the called according to his purpose, which he goes on then to elaborate. So I say that we must regard this as essentially a new subsection, though it has this connection with what he has just been saying. That, of course, is one of the characteristics. Of the Apostle's style, we've seen him doing that so frequently. That's why I always feel a good comparison to use in describing the Apostle's style is the comparison of a great Symphony, how you get to the themes hinted it, and then how each one is taken up in turn. But then at the end of anyone hint is thrown out of the one that's to come, and then that's taken up in its fullness and worked out, and then a hint of the following one, and then that's taken up in the new section. Well, that's precisely what this apostle does. So that there is a a connection between each of the parts, and yet they are distinct parts in this hole which the apostle is working out very well. Now, the first thing we have to do, therefore, as we approach this new section, is to give the kind of general analysis of it. And I suggest that the analysis is something like this. In verse 28, the apostle lays down a proposition. He makes an assertion. That's verse 28. Then in verses 29 and 30 he proves his proposition. He demonstrates his assertion. Or if you like he having really made a comprehensive statement in verse 28, in verses 29 and 30 he elaborates his last statement. In 28. That phrase about the called according to his purpose. In verses 29 and 30 he tells us more in detail what that means. Very well. Then there is our general analysis of this paragraph. And again, you see the apostle is doing something that is so characteristic of himself that that again, is, as we've seen so frequently, his great method. He makes a statement, he throws out in the social, but he never leaves it at that. He always argues it out. He always gives us reasons. That is the peculiar quality, of course, of his mind. And our view of inspiration is 1. Which includes these variations in the styles of the different men, and we must always hold on to that. We don't believe in mechanical dictation. We believe in the absolute control of the spirit over the minds and thinking and style and everything else of the men. The Holy Spirit so controlled them that they were kept from any error, but the Holy Spirit didn't dictate to them, otherwise there'd be no variation in the style. But there is a great variation, and this is particularly characteristic of the style of this apostle. And incidentally, on that point, any translation of the Bible that does away with the variations in the styles of the author is a bad translation. And there is one at the present time, which is very popular. Now. Let's leave that and go on. Let's not forget this. The style is surely something that should interest us and should cause us to Marvel. You see, God does that everywhere. That's what you get in creation. You get all these variations, even within the same species, and so on. God brings in these wonderful variations, and yet he controls all it's it's a very wonderful and very thrilling thought to me. Well, now then, let's proceed to consider what he says in this paragraph. I needn't take any time need I? In reminding you that we are looking here at one of the most remarkable statements that even this apostle ever made. It's one of the most wonderful and most comforting statements in the whole range of scripture. Cause this chapter, as we've been seeing, is full of such things. And there are more to come. But I think I'm entitled to say that from the standpoint of sheer statement of the exalted doctrine, there is really nothing higher than this. Here is the ultimate doctrine. There's nothing that one can conceive of which is beyond what the apostle says in this small paragraph in this short subsection. And I think we all ought to feel that there's no greater privilege on Earth than being allowed to look together and to examine a statement such as this, realizing as we do so that we are not just like students of philosophy or art or anything else. We are here as people who are considering doctrine about ourselves. That's the Marvel and the wonder of it all. These things, even this exalted doctrine, is written for our comfort, for our consolation as well As for our edification. Well, not, and let's proceed to look at it. And I suggest some such division of the matter as this. First of all, we must look at the statement itself. Then, having looked at the statement itself, we will go on to consider how we know that the statement is true. And that, incidentally, is my subdivision of verse 28. Only that's how I would divide verse 28. There's a statement in it, and we're also told how we may know that the statement is true. Very well, let's start with a statement. Here it is. We know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose. Now, what have we got to say about the statement? Well, the first thing we have to do is because he makes us do it. We've got to notice the limitation in the statement. There is a limitation in the statement at once. In other words, he doesn't say that all things work together for good for everybody. That isn't what he says. He limits it. All things work together for good. Only to the people specified in the statement and not to anybody else now in the original, in the Greek, this comes out much more clearly than it does in our translations. He puts it like this and we know that to the ones loving God, all things work together for good, and you see the importance of. Putting that at the beginning, it it emphasizes that so that there can be no mistake about it at all. It is to the ones loving God that all things work together for good. That's what we know. And that brings out, I say this point that it is only applicable to God's people, to Christian people. Now here we come up against something which is. Emphasized everywhere in the Bible, from beginning to end, you see, there's only one division of the human race. Here it is. We're on one side or the other of this dividing line. It doesn't matter about any other division or distinction. And this is something which is true only of those who love God or those who are the cold according to his purpose. As for the rest, the scripture tells us quite plainly. That all things do not work together for good to them. They we are told, are under the wrath of God. The wrath of God is revealed from him. He's already told us in the sent in the 18th verse of this epistle. In the first chapter, the wrath of God is revealed from him against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness. That is their position. They are under the wrath of God. And far from it's being true to say that all things are working together for their good, we really are entitled to say that all things are working together to the exact opposite end. They don't know that, but that is the simple truth. Whatever may be true of them at the moment, however prosperous, however happy they may be, however much the sun may seem to be shining upon them, the terrible fact about them is that they're under the wrath of God. And though appearances may be lie, that they will ultimately discover that that is their position and that is their state. Now. This is of course all important, and never was it more important perhaps, than at a time like this. That is why, you see, it is only Christian people who've got any consolation in the world as it is at the present time. There's no consolation for anybody else, and they're beginning to see that. Well, here's an opportunity of telling them, therefore, that the only way to have the consolation is to believe the gospel to conform to God's way and manner of life and of living. All these promises are only for these people. Now, it's very important we should realize that, because sometimes people in an expensive sort of mood. Attempted to say something like this in general, that all things work together for good. Isn't it marvelous? Now everything seems to be conspiring together for our wellbeing. But that isn't what we're told here. Now the poets have sometimes put it like that. Take Browning for instance. He works out to this point. He puts it like this, he says the years at the spring and days at the morning, mornings at 7, the hillsides dew pearled. The larks and the wing, the snails and the thorn gods in his heaven halls. Right with the world. You see, that's the sort of thing they wrote in the Victorian era. No wars, no bombs. They'd been a long peace. The Pax Britannica. No war worth Speaking of in a sense, since the Napoleonic Wars and everything developing and adventuring, the hellsian days. Of mid and late victorianism. And they sang in this way, all right with the world. That's the sort of thing the poets say. They don't always say it. The poet has to be in a given mood before he writes like that. He was particularly happy. The mules have been stimulated by something, and so they make these wonderful assertions. But of course they're not true. You read the private lives of many of these poets, you'll find it wasn't true in their own lives. And it's most certainly not true of the world. You can't draw these deductions. It simply isn't true. Nobody would believe that today. All right with the world. Yes. Well, you see, he's looking at the dew drops and the hillside and the lark and the snail. And we would say to him today, look at the hydrogen bun, look at the Rockets, look at the army is messing. You still say the same thing. Cause he wouldn't. He couldn't. So that shows you, you see the difference between the false optimism of the world, these generalities in which such people delight, and the particular statements of the scripture. No, no, all's not right with the world. All's wrong with the world. And that's why the Christian salvation has ever become necessary. That old false optimism, thank God that at any rate, has gone. I prefer to see people believing nothing and feeling utterly hopeless and bereft, rather than lulling them to sleep with a false kind of optimism that doesn't stand up to the test of reality. It's very good poetry, I agree, but I'm concerned about the sentiment, the meaning rather than the ability of the poet as such. Well, now then, there is the limitation, and we must pay careful attention to it. But now let's go on and look at the meaning of the assertion. And this, of course, will immediately show us why the limitation is inevitable, that it only applies to these people. Why? Well, the meaning is this. All things work together for good. Now what does this mean? Well, you will notice that some of the manuscripts, as the commentators point out very rightly. Some of the older manuscripts and early manuscripts. They have an additional statement here. They put it like this. We know that God works together all things for good to them that love God. In some of those old manuscripts you find that that it is God who works all things together. Now here in this authorized translation, based on the particular text which they used, we don't have that addition. But of course it doesn't make the slightest difference because we know that it is God who. It works all things, all things do not work in and of themselves. There is no principle in life itself doing this. It is God who is doing this. So whether we adopt one ancient text or another, it doesn't make the slightest difference, because the view taught in the Bible everywhere is this is the view concerning the Providence of God. It is God who not only has made everything, it is God who sustains everything. It is God who controls everything. The universe isn't working automatically. It is still under the control of God through the Lord Jesus Christ. By him, all things subsist. They've not only come into being, they still subsist in that way, so that we must not say. We cannot say that all things work together automatically. It is God who controls everything. In any case, it is quite obvious, isn't it? Even if you adopted the other view that all things would not differentiate between those who love God and the and the other people. But what we are told here is that all things work together for good to them that love God. Whereas if you just look at the universe and it's working as if there were no God, well, you wouldn't be able to detect any difference between the godly and the ungodly. Indeed, sometimes. You'd come to the conclusion that the ungodly are the favorites. They seem to be having a better time very often than the Godly people themselves. But the fact is that if the universe were just working automatically and we're not under the control of God, they would not be the slightest difference to what happens to the Christian and the non-christian. They would all be subject in exactly the same way to the things that happen, whereas our whole statement is. That there is this wonderful difference between those who love God and those who don't love God. To those who love God, all things work together for good, so that the real meaning of the statement is this, that God is over ruling all things in such a way that they turn out for the good and the benefit of his people. Now there's the fundamental assertion. Now we must analyze that and see exactly what it means, because it is, I say, the one of the most glorious things we can ever know about ourselves. Now, my friend, do you realize that about yourself at this moment? Did you know that as a Christian that all things are working together for good for you? Did you know that God is over ruling everything in the whole cosmos for you are good? Did you know it? Well, if you did, you're not depressed, are you?\rAnd you haven't been depressed all day because you can't believe a thing like this and be depressed at the same time. They're mutually exclusive. Now then, here, you see is the practical aspect of this great and glorious teaching. Let's, let's work it out. Let's see exactly what it does. Tell us. It says all things. What does that mean? Well, there are some of the commentators who says who say that all things mean trials and tribulations only. The Great John Calvin, for instance, said that. In other words, he limits the all things by what has been dealt with in the previous verses, all the trials and the troubles and the tribulations with which the apostle began to deal in verse 17 and which he's continued to deal with until the end of verse 27. They say all things is confined to that. We know that whatever may happen to us along that line. Still is being made by God to work for our good. Well, now it seems to me that there is no justification at all for limiting it to that, and it does seem to me to detract from the glory of the statement that we should put such a limit upon it. The apostle says all things, and I think he means all things. He means good things, favorable things. But he also means things that seem to be against us, things that seem to be bad for us, things that are discouraging, disheartening, dispiriting. I believe he includes all those. In the end, of course, it comes to the same thing, but therefore let us take it in its comprehensive and in its fullest aspect. It's interesting to notice, as we've had to notice so often in working through this 8th chapter. That the greater apostle is here really, in a sense, taking up what he's already said in Chapter 5 in verses three to five. There you remember he puts it like this. Having said that, we rejoice in hope of the glory of God, he goes on. And not only so, but we glory. We in glory in tribulations, also knowing the tribulation, work with patience and patience, experience and experience, hope and hope make it not a shame, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts. By the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us. Never forget that 5th chapter. As I said at the time, that is in many ways the key to this epistle. All his major themes are there, and he takes them up 11 by 1, and he's working them out, and that's what he's working out here. In other words, then we say this, that everything is working together for our good, good things. Trials, troubles, tribulations, illnesses, accidents, disappointments, even failure. Yes, even sin. God can make all and does make all work ultimately for our girl. Now this is surely a very staggering statement, but it is the statement that is made by the apostle very well. That means that we've got to consider together the explanation of the statement. How are all things made to work together for our good? Now here again, it is quite clear, surely how this statement must be limited only to Christian people and has got nothing to do with people who are not Christians. It is only in the case of Christians that we can demonstrate how exactly this happens, how all things are made to work together for our good. Because the trials and tribulations and failure and sin are not good in and of themselves. It's probably to pretend that they're good. They're not good in and of themselves, they're bad. Well, how does he make the statement then, that they all work together for good? That is the whole novel of this Christian position. They are so used by God and overruled by God and implied by God that they turn out into our girl. Now there's the essential point that we've got a grasp here. The things are not good in and of themselves. Now many people have fallen into that trap you read the lives of. Some of the Saints dinner it some of the socalled Saints, and you will find that many of them fell into error at this point. They believed that there was some inherent good in suffering, so when they were not suffering, they courted suffering and they deliberately brought suffering upon themselves, all tendencies to mutilate the body. And as it were to scarify the flesh, as a result of that particular error, they almost got into the position that they believed that there was something inherently good in suffering in that way. And obviously this is the whole theory that leads to a kind of masochism. And many of the Saints have been guilty of that very thing. It's a perverted notion. It's quite unlike the teaching which we've got here or anywhere else in the whole of scripture. So the statement is not that these things are good in and of themselves. If they were good in and of themselves they do as much good to the non Christian as they do to the Christian. But they don't. No, no. It is what God does with them that turns them into our good. Now then what happens? Well it surely works like this. There's no need to spend any time in showing how the good things work for our good. That's obvious. The problem is, how do we show that things that seem to be against us work to our good? How can I argue that trials, tribulations, persecutions or sickness, physical weakness, all these things that trouble us and get us down so much? How can we demonstrate that these things work together for good to us who are Christians?\rWell, they do it in some such way as this. They start by just pulling us up, and that's a very good thing for us, all of this. The most dangerous thing for all of us is that everything should be just going well, without much change and without much incident. That's always a dangerous condition to be in. Now that's just human nature, isn't it? It's something that could be illustrated endlessly. In the natural realm, in life, many a man has found that in his business, in the days when he was struggling and having problems and difficulties, well, he was paying much attention to everything and everything went well. When he gets over this and he gets into this second stage. Everything seems to be running smoothly and automatically. That's a very dangerous stage in that man's business. He can become slack and negligent and things can begin to go along and he won't see them. He won't know that they're happening because he's not showing the same keenness as he was before. Well, now it's exactly the same in the Christian life, in the spiritual life, when everything is just coming and going, the wheel is just turning round. Or as the phrase goes about the engine of the car just taking over. It's a very dangerous state for the soul. Very often that's just the time when our enemy, our adversary, comes in. So when anything goes wrong, there's a trial or a tribulation, it has the effect of pulling us up. It breaks the routine. It startles us, it awakens us. Now I say that's always good for us because it makes us think. And anything that makes us think is always very good for us. The worst state to be in is a state in which a man doesn't think, just takes things for granted, just goes on with his routine. It's a wonderful thing to have your routine upset, and it doesn't matter very much from this standpoint what it is that upsets it. It's always good, I say, to do that. And of course, if things don't do this for you, that's where discipline comes in. That's where self examination is important. That's where setting certain times for this may have some kind of justification. And that's why these things have come into the practice and the habit of the Christian Church throughout the centuries. Very well, there's the first effect. We are shocked. We are awake, we're made to think, and already we are in a better state than we were before. Very well, we are now going to pay attention to the problem. It's like a man, you see, whose health had been running down and he wasn't very well aware of it. Just went on, perhaps not feeling as well as he was, but he could shake it off. It wasn't anything very rare. Suddenly gets a severe pain. Well, now he's got to pay attention to it. He's got to send for his doctor. And the doctor discovers that this thing has been growing and developing in the men for quite a long time and says, why didn't you come to me before? But the men didn't go until the pain made him go. Well, now that's the kind of thing the tribulations and trials do to us. They pull us up, they make us pay attention to the thing, and now we are beginning to face the position as it is. And what do they do? What do we find? Well, what we find is this. These are troubles and problems and toils that come in various ways. They reveal at once to us our own smallness and our own weakness and our own frailty. We don't always realize that the devil tries to develop in us a kind of self-confidence. We started by knowing that we've been saved by grace, but we begin to think that we are running this Christian life ourselves, and we develop a kind of confidence. Suddenly we find ourselves knocked down, as it were, and we are reminded again of our smallness, our frailty and our weakness, and still more our lack of understanding. You see, we've been going on and we've been reading a lot of theology and other books, and we really thought we knew all about it. We were complete authorities in all God's ways, and nothing could ever upset us. We really now did understand everything. Suddenly we are stricken in some way and we find ourselves as helpless as babes. We just don't understand. We see our smallness in particular in this matter of understanding. We see that the whole thing is so much bigger than we thought. We thought we'd reduced it to our system, but we haven't. Or to our knowledge, but we haven't. And here I say immediately, we are caused to see our lack of understanding and of knowledge. And then in turn that leads us to see our own sinfulness and our readiness to have wrong ideas of God. We've got so much of this described in the Bible, haven't we? We get it in the biographies. We've known it ourselves. When things go wrong, we tend to complain and to grumble and to wonder why God has allowed this to happen to us, why should it happen to me? And so on. And contrast ourselves with other people, the godless, who are having such a wonderful time, and so on, and we were not. Here we're awakened to our own utter sinfulness and our readiness and promise to harbor such unworthy thoughts. And ideas concerning God, who has loved us with an everlasting love. Well, these things, they just knock us down and they bring us to that realization about ourselves. In other words, they humble us. They humble us. And there's nothing better for us than that. We should be humbled, every one of us. We are in a dangerous state when we are not humble, and we must be humble in every respect. If we are not humble in every respect, we are in great danger, and it we mustn't be surprised if we find ourselves being humbled. Now this great apostle, you remember, puts that to us so clearly in the classical passage on this whole matter in two Corinthians 12 he tells us exactly why this sort of thing happened to him, lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations. There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the message of Messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. 2 Corinthians 12, chapter verse 7. Now there it is. He recognizes it in himself because of the amazing experience. He'd had the tendency to be puffed up, and he had to be brought down, lest I be exalted above measure. Now you see, we are following the process of these things that seem to be hard and against us and unpleasant for our good. They knock us down, they humble us and it's a good place to be. He that is down in fear, no fall, he that is low. No pride, humility is ever this greatest safeguard in this spiritual life. So when we are brought down and broad, low and humble, it's a very good thing for us. And anything that does that for us is working for our good. And there, in this condition, we begin to see a whole host of things that we've been tending to forget. We see our need of forgiveness. You know, I've known Christian people who said, quite sincerely, that they really didn't think that there was any need for them as Christians to ask to be forgiven. What a terrible state to be in. Well, when you're knocked down like this and when you really allow it to work its way through, you'll soon see the need of forgiveness. Where it merely for your wrong thoughts about God, your unworthy thoughts, your tendency to grumble and to complain. It's a horrible sin. It's a terrible sin, much worse than sins of the flesh, because it's an evil, unworthy thought about the God of love who has done so much for us. We see our need of forgiveness. We see our need of strength. We see our need of help. And thus, you know, Rutter helplessness. We are driven back to God now. Then anything that drives us back to God is good for us. That's how it works out. It drives these things drive us back to God because we didn't know what to do. We've already admitted it up in prayer. We know not what to pray for us. We ought, but that makes us pray all the more. We cry out with these groomings. And that's a good state to be in, because it's driven us back to an utter entire dependence upon God. And of course, once we do that, we now begin to discover things about God that we never knew before. This is how we get to grow in knowledge, in grace, and in the knowledge of God. Or if we did know something before, we get to know them with a new depth, with a new meaning, with a new understanding. It has been the universal testimony of the Saints of the centuries that it is through this kind of experience they've really got to know God, the child, the baby in Christ, he knows very little about God. He knows he's forgiven. Oh, but that's the mere beginning. It's the first principles of the Gospel of Christ. There are depths. There are riches that he knows nothing about. And sometimes it's necessary that he should be dealt with in this way in order to bring him to that knowledge. What knowledge will? I'm thinking of things like this. It is only in that sort of condition we really get to know the love and the grace of God, his kindness, his compassion, his tenderness, his patience, his long-suffering. How little we know of that. But, you know, these are some of the great characteristics, the attributes of God. How much do we know about God's patience, God's solicitude, God's tenderness, God's care for us? It's only in this sort of condition that we begin rarely to learn about that and his readiness to forget, his readiness to restore, his readiness to help and to lead. We can read the parable of the Prodigal Son and accept it theoretically. Have you known God dealing with you like that? What a wonderful revelation it is of the character of God and of his heart of love. It's only when you've been through this kind of experience you get to know that you knew it theoretically, but now you know it in a much deeper way when you've actually passed through the experience yourself. In other words, let me sum it up like this. Our greatest trouble is our ignorance of God. We don't know God as we ought. We know things about God. But our real trouble, every one of us, is our ignorance of God himself, what he really is and what he is to his people, and the way he brings us to that knowledge, and the way in which he reveals himself to us in this way is by using these various things that happen to us. In order to bring us to the knowledge, these are the ways he uses to draw us to himself. Now then, this is our greatest need, I say, and it is also at the same time the best preparation for eternity, and for dwelling everlastingly in the presence of God. Now there is the first answer to the question, how do all things work together for our good? They do it by bringing us back to God and to a fresh revelation of what he rarely is in his dealings with his people. Now it's a tragedy that this should be necessary, but that's what sin has done to us. That is what sin has done to men. He can't take the truth directly and positively. This sort of thing has to happen to us in order to bring us to our senses and in order to make us amenable to the knowledge. But not only that, you see, it works like this. These things happening to us compel us to realize the nature of our life in this world. That's how far trouble, isn't it. The world is too much with us. We've got our business, our profession, our family, our affairs. And half our spiritual troubles arise from the fact that we are lost in these things and we tend to live for them. It's very difficult not to. We are in the flesh still, and here are these things drawing us from all directions. These are the things that stand between us and the knowledge of God and the knowledge of eternity. But you see, when these things happen to you, they teach you that you've got to be detached. Very difficult to detach yourself from this life and this world when you're well and healthy and strong. But when you're lying on a sick bed, it isn't quite so difficult, is it? You're bound to think about it and how slow we are to think about these things. You're reminded that you're only here for a while, and that's a very good thing for us because it makes us become a little loose in our attachment to the world. It shakes us, shakes us out of it, and reminds us that we are nothing but pilgrims and strangers. Or, to put it positively, these things make us think more of the glory to which we are going now. Why do we think so little about that glory here? It is described to us in the scriptures. This amazing glory that's coming, which the apostle has been describing in detail to us, the whole creation is waiting for this manifestation of the sons of God. That's you and myself. We are the sons of God now. This glory is indescribable, as we've seen. Well, why do we think so little about it? Why do we meditate so little concerning it? The answer is we are too preoccupied with this life, with this world, with the things that are seen, the things that are round and about us. And when we are suddenly deprived of these things, or has shown our loose attachment to them, we begin to remind ourselves that we're after all pilgrims of eternity. That death is not the end, that there is a glory awakening us. And we begin to think of that glory. And anything that makes you think of that is a very good thing for you. I don't care what it is. It may be an illness. It may be an accident. It may be a disappointment. I don't care what it is. My friend. You may have come in here. I'm very disappointed tonight. Something's gone wrong, perhaps in your personal life, in your emotional life. I don't care what it is. And you were struck down. You shouldn't be. As a Christian, you should be made to think by this that you really are destined for that indescribable glory that's coming. And you made and you're made to think more of that. That's a very good thing for you. The thing that seemed hard and troublesome and almost cruel is being used for your good. It makes you think of this, and it's thus you see, to use the phrase that the apostle is going to use later on in this very chapter in verse 37. It is in this way that we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. And now as Christians, we are meant to be more than conquerors. It's the same thing, exactly, as saying that all these things work together. For our good. Now, as we close tonight, let me put it like this in an illustration that I once heard was used by an old preacher about 100 years ago. I think it was a good illustration. It helped people at the time, it seems to me, to be a good one, he said. Now here's a statement which appears to be contradictory. All things work together for good to them that love God. Well, how can that be?\rThe good things, I can see they're working in this direction. But look at those other things. They seem to be working in the opposite direction. How can you say that things which are working in opposite directions are for my good? Well, the illustration that was used by the old preacher was an illustration of a watch. He said take your watch and open it. And what you see, well, you see that one wheel is turning this way. It's turning in an anticlockwise direction. But there it's attached to another wheel that's working the opposite way, in a clockwise direction. And you open your watch and you look at this machine and you say, this is mad, this is quite ridiculous. Here are wheels working in opposite directions. The man who made that watch must have been a madman. But the answer is, of course he wasn't. That's how he's arranged that this watch is going to work and the hens are going to move around because all these different wheels are ultimately controlled by a mainspring. There's a purpose at the back of it all, and at the back of the main spring is the man, the watchmaker, who made the watch. It can be wound up, and this spring now is going to control everything, one turning this way, one turning that way. But they're all working together to move the pins round. And so, you know, the time and all these things that appear to be in contradiction are working together to the same end, he said. It's like that. You look at life. And you say at first what's happened. I can see that certain things are good for him. But look at these other things. These are all against me. Think again, Lisa. Think again. Think of the one who's planned it all. Don't jump to conclusions. Look for an ultimate purpose. Look for an ultimate end. And if you do so with a spiritual eye, as you should, you will soon begin to see. That God knows what he's doing. We shall see this, of course, in the great doctrine to which we are coming. It's his purpose. Yes. Look at it again with spiritual eyes and you'll come to the conclusion that all things, everything, every part and portion of it, everything that's happening to you is working together. God's made it like that. It's wounded up. He keeps it going. All is working together for our girl. Our immediate good, but still more our ultimate, our final good. Well, God willing, we'll go on in working out the details of this glorious statement. Oh Lord our God, we come to thee again to OfferUp our praise. Lord, we thank thee that our salvation is altogether and entirely of thee. We see more and more that if any part of it were of us, it would fail. Well, we see that we cannot think properly even in the Christian life. We see we are ever subject to the insinuations of the devil, ever ready to think harsh and worthy thoughts of thee. Oh God, we thank thee that we are in thy hands, and that thy thoughts are not our thoughts, nor our thy ways, our ways. We thank thee, O Lord, that there's an eternal difference between them. As I, as the heavens are above the earth, so are thy thoughts and our thoughts. And thy ways and our ways, Lord, we thank thee that it is so, and that our safety and our security lie in this fact, and that our joy and our happiness lie in the same fact. Therefore, oh God, we worship thee, and adore thee, we praise thy name. Oh, Grant that we all may know this blessed assurance that we are in thy hands, that we are thy people. And that therefore all things are working together, even now, for our good, temporal and eternal. And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the love of God and the fellowship in the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us Now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour, short uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage. And until we arrive ultimately in that glory, perfect and tired and complete Amen, we do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Doctor Martin Lloyd Jones.

不要往伯特利寻求、不要进入吉甲、不要过到别是巴。因为吉甲必被掳掠、伯特利也必归于无有。\n5:6 要寻求耶和华、就必存活。免得他在约瑟家像火发出、在伯特利焚烧、无人扑灭。3\n5:7 你们这使公平变为茵蔯、将公义丢弃于地的、 5:8 要寻求那造昴星和参星、使死荫变为晨光、使白日变为黑夜、命海水来浇在地上的、（耶和华是他的名)\n5:9 他使力强的忽遭灭亡、以致保障遭遇毁坏。\n5:10 你们怨恨那在城门口责备人的、憎恶那说正直话的。\n5:11 你们践踏贫民、向他们勒索麦子。你们用凿过的石头建造房屋、却不得住在其内、栽种美好的葡萄园、却不得喝所出的酒。\n5:12 我知道你们的罪过何等多、你们的罪恶何等大。你们苦待义人、收受贿赂、在城门口屈枉穷乏人。\n5:13 所以通达人见这样的时势、必静默不言。因为时势真恶。\n5:14 你们要求善、不要求恶、就必存活。这样、耶和华万军之　神必照你们所说的、与你们同在。\n5:15 要恶恶好善、在城门口秉公行义。或者耶和华万军之　神向约瑟的余民施恩。4\n5:16 主耶和华万军之　神如此说、在一切宽阔处必有哀号的声音。在各街市上必有人说、哀哉、哀哉。又必叫农夫来哭号、叫善唱哀歌的来举哀。\n5:17 在各葡萄园必有哀号的声音。因为我必从你中间经过。这是耶和华说的。\n5:18 想望耶和华日子来到的、有祸了。你们为何想望耶和华的日子呢。那日黑暗没有光明。\n5:19 景况好像人躲避狮子又遇见熊、或是进房屋以手靠墙、就被蛇咬。\n5:20 耶和华的日子、不是黑暗没有光明么。不是幽暗毫无光辉么。\n5:21 我厌恶你们的节期、也不喜悦你们的严肃会。\n5:22 你们虽然向我献燔祭、和素祭、我却不悦纳。也不顾你们用肥畜献的平安祭。\n5:23 要使你们歌唱的声音远离我。因为我不听你们弹琴的响声。\n5:24 惟愿公平如大水滚滚、使公义如江河滔滔。5\n5:25 以色列家阿、你们在旷野四十年、岂是将祭物和供物献给我呢。6\n5:26 你们抬着为自己所造之摩洛的帐幕和偶像的龛、并你们的神星。\n5:27 所以我要把你们掳到大马色以外。这是耶和华名为万军之　神说的。\n  这首哀歌的平行对称结构（Chiastic Parallelism）如下：\n举哀（2-3节）\n劝诫（4-6节）\n控诉（7节）\n赞美（8节）\n「耶和华是祂的名」（8节）\n赞美（9节）\n控诉（10-13节）\n劝诫（14-15节）\n举哀（16-17节）\n这首精心设计的哀歌以举哀开始，又以举哀结束，表明审判是不可避免的。但这首哀歌的中心却是劝诫百姓寻求神——「耶和华是祂的名」（8节）。百姓或是「寻求耶和华，就必存活」（6节）；或是预备在争战中迎见祂（四12），自取灭亡。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 阿摩司预告，将来北国以色列只有十分之一的人能够存活（3节），因此提前为北国作「哀歌」（1节），以提醒百姓「寻求耶和华，就必存活」（4、6、14节）。\n虽然审判已经成为定局，整个国家已经没有希望，但神还是三次向百姓指出「就必存活」（4、6、14节）的出路；先知也一面为百姓吟唱哀歌，一面催促百姓寻求神。因为「照着拣选的恩典，还有所留的余数」（罗十一5）。但先知也很清楚地知道，唯有那些蒙神拣选的「余民」（15节），才有可能听从劝诫、回转寻求神。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 因此，人若真正相信神「预定我们借着耶稣基督得儿子的名分」（弗一5），传福音就会绝不放弃、也从不失望，因为我们知道「凡预定得永生的人」（徒十三48）才会相信、也必会相信，我们的责任就是「务要传道，无论得时不得时」（提后四2）。人若不相信神的「预定」，既经不起失败的考验，也胜不过成功的试探，常常自以为义、让人倍感压力。 (预定论的看法)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 虽然审判的结局已经定了，但百姓如果真的「寻求耶和华」（4、6节），不但远离虚无的偶像（5节），而且在生活中「要求善，不要求恶」（14节），结果「就必存活」（4、6、14节）。在覆巢之下，仍然能成为蒙神施恩的「余民」（15节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神「惟愿公平如大水滚滚，使公义如江河滔滔」（24节），不是要人改变社会制度、努力提升道德，而是要求立约之民真实地敬畏、顺服神，接受基督在心中执掌王权，祂必「在地上施行公平和公义」（耶二十三5），让神的百姓活出「大水滚滚、江河滔滔」的公义见证。今天，信徒若把世上的国与神的国混为一谈，用「公平、公义」来代替真理、用政治来代替福音，乃是舍本逐末，从来就没有成功过。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 虽然百姓中也有专心跟从神的人（民三十二12），但神所要的是「以色列家」（25节）团体的见证、团体的跟从。因此，在神看来，他们「岂是将祭物和供物献给我呢」（25节）？只不过是把神当作另一个可以操纵的偶像罢了（26节；出三十二8）。\n今天，不少信徒也是从初信开始，就把神当作一个可以用奉献、事奉来交换平安、福气的偶像，用读经、祷告来摇动其手的金牛犊。神也照样提醒我们：你们「岂是将祭物和供物献给我呢」？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

主耶和华指着自己的圣洁起誓说、日子快到、人必用钩子将你们钩去、用鱼钩将你们余剩的钩去。\n4:3 你们各人必从破口直往前行、投入哈门。这是耶和华说的。\n4:4 以色列人哪、任你们往伯特利去犯罪、到吉甲加增罪过。每日早晨献上你们的祭物、每三日奉上你们的十分之一。\n4:5 任你们献有酵的感谢祭、把甘心祭宣传报告给众人。因为是你们所喜爱的。这是主耶和华说的。1\n4:6 我使你们在一切城中牙齿干净、在你们各处粮食缺乏。你们仍不归向我。这是耶和华说的。\n4:7 在收割的前三月我使雨停止、不降在你们那里。我降雨在这城、不降雨在那城。这块地有雨、那块地无雨。无雨的就枯干了。\n4:8 这样、两三城的人凑到一城去找水、却喝不足。你们仍不归向我。这是耶和华说的。\n4:9 我以旱风、霉烂攻击你们。你们园中许多菜蔬、葡萄树、无花果树、橄榄树都被剪虫所吃。你们仍不归向我。这是耶和华说的。\n4:10 我降瘟疫在你们中间、像在埃及一样。用刀杀戮你们的少年人、使你们的马匹被掳掠、营中尸首的臭气扑鼻。你们仍不归向我。这是耶和华说的。\n4:11 我倾覆你们中间的城邑、如同我从前倾覆所多玛蛾摩拉一样、使你们好像从火中抽出来的一根柴。你们仍不归向我。这是耶和华说的。2\n4:12 以色列阿、我必向你如此行。以色列阿、我既这样行、你当预备迎见你的　神。3\n4:13 那创山、造风、将心意指示人、使晨光变为幽暗、脚踏在地之高处的。他的名是耶和华万军之　神。\n  百姓的宗教热诚高涨，却不能使他们归向神（6节），只能使他们归向金牛犊和偶像；他们的敬拜和事奉只是人「所喜爱的」，与神毫无关系。今天，许多外表热闹的敬拜，实际上是人的自娱自乐、自我安慰；许多出于肉体的事奉，实际上是人在贿赂偶像、换取利益。北国宗教的特点是：\n看起来热心敬虔，献上自己；却只肯做自己「所喜爱的」事奉，实际是为了满足自己。\n不肯默默事奉，只做在神面前；却喜欢「宣传报告给众人」，做在众人面前。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 6-11节列出了七灾：饥荒、干旱、霉烂、蝗虫、瘟疫、战争、倾覆，都是神早已预言过的管教（利二十六14-39）。神在出埃及时用来对付仇敌的灾祸，现在却被用来管教百姓。\n在原文中，这七灾都是过去式，代表已经发生过的警告性灾祸，并非最后的审判。神五次强调「你们仍不归向我」（6、8、9、10、11节），说明神用七灾管教百姓的目的，是为了使百姓回转归向祂。但百姓却屡教不改、屡唤不醒，神恒久忍耐的爱，与人的顽梗悖逆成为鲜明的对比。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「预备」、「迎见」（12节）神，原文与以色列人在西奈山下「预备」（出十九11、15）、「迎接」（出十九17）神相同。当神在西奈山颁布十诫的时候（出二十1-17），「众百姓见雷轰、闪电、角声、山上冒烟，就都发颤，远远地站立」（出二十18），不敢直接听神说话（出二十19）。摩西安慰他们说：「不要惧怕；因为神降临是要试验你们，叫你们时常敬畏祂，不致犯罪」（出二十20）。神的「试验」已经让罪人「发颤」，何况现在将迎接的是神的审判呢？\n过去，摩西把「生死祸福」（申三十19）都陈明在百姓面前，并且呼吁百姓：「要拣选生命，使你和你的后裔都得存活」（申三十19）。现在，神再次让百姓选择怎样「预备迎见你的神」（12节），并且三次宣告：百姓若寻求神，「就必存活」（五4、6、14）。但是，人已经全然败坏、执迷不悟，只能面临彻底的拆毁和审判。为此，先知不得不为他的听众作了一首「哀歌」（五1-17）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

all the earth is Mine. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.”\nDeuteronomy 7:6\n“ For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth. 1 Peter 4:17\nFor the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?\nRomans 2:9\ntribulation and anguish, on every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek;\nEzekiel 20:36-38\nJust as I pleaded My case with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will plead My case with you,” says the Lord GOD. “ I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant; I will purge the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the country where they dwell, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord. Deuteronomy 10:15\nThe Lord delighted only in your fathers, to love them; and He chose their descendants after them, you above all peoples, as it is this day. Genesis 10:32\nThese were the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and from these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood. Isaiah 63:19\nWe have become like those of old, over whom You never ruled, Those who were never called by Your name. Jeremiah 9:25\n“ Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord,“ that I will punish all who are circumcised with the uncircumcised—\nJeremiah 10:25\nPour out Your fury on the Gentiles, who do not know You, And on the families who do not call on Your name; For they have eaten up Jacob, Devoured him and consumed him, And made his dwelling place desolate. Jeremiah 11:22\ntherefore thus says the Lord of hosts:‘ Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;\nMatthew 11:20-24\nThen He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent:“ Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.”\nDaniel 9:12\nAnd He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us a great disaster; for under the whole heaven such has never been done as what has been done to Jerusalem. Psalms 147:19\nHe declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel. Jeremiah 14:10\nThus says the Lord to this people:“ Thus they have loved to wander; They have not restrained their feet. Therefore the Lord does not accept them; He will remember their iniquity now, And punish their sins.”\nZechariah 14:17-18\nAnd it shall be that whichever of the families of the earth do not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, on them there will be no rain.If the family of Egypt will not come up and enter in, they shall have no rain; they shall receive the plague with which the Lord strikes the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. Deuteronomy 32:9\nFor the LORD’s portion is His people; Jacob is the place of His inheritance. Jeremiah 1:15\nFor behold, I am calling All the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says the Lord;“ They shall come and each one set his throne At the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, Against all its walls all around, And against all the cities of Judah. Ezekiel 9:6\nUtterly slay old and young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the temple. Jeremiah 13:21\nWhat will you say when He punishes you? For you have taught them To be chieftains, to be head over you. Will not pangs seize you, Like a woman in labor?\nDeuteronomy 26:18\nAlso today the Lord has proclaimed you to be His special people, just as He promised you, that you should keep all His commandments, Hosea 2:13\nI will punish her For the days of the Baals to which she burned incense. She decked herself with her earrings and jewelry, And went after her lovers; But Me she forgot,” says the Lord. Nahum 3:4\nBecause of the multitude of harlotries of the seductive harlot, The mistress of sorceries, Who sells nations through her harlotries, And families through her sorceries. Luke 12:47-48\nAnd that servant who knew his master’s will, and did not prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been committed, of him they will ask the more. Hosea 8:13\nFor the sacrifices of My offerings they sacrifice flesh and eat it, But the Lord does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return to Egypt. Hosea 9:9\nThey are deeply corrupted, As in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; He will punish their sins. Acts 17:26\nAnd He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, I would like to share my meditation on one verse. The first part of the verse goes \u0026ldquo;You only have I known of all the families of the earth. (NKJV)\u0026rdquo; What the position believers are! How special we are! Praise the Lord. The last part of the verse goes \u0026ldquo;Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. (NKJV)\u0026rdquo;. What a contrary this is! Believers don\u0026rsquo;t want to read this part. We would want to hear \u0026ldquo;How great thou are!\u0026rdquo;. We would want to hear \u0026ldquo;God is good, God restored my health\u0026rdquo;. This verse reminds me God is righteous. He holds us accountable for sins we made even though we are believers. Sure, God forgives our sin, and yet we will get consequences, maybe now, maybe at the Judgement Day. Would we be tremble? Would we want to flee from sins, and live a holy life?

神追讨摩押的原因，并不像另外5个外邦国家，是因为他们对付神的百姓（一3、6、9、11、13），而是因为摩押和以东两个外邦国家之间的仇恨。这表明神不只是以色列的神，也是全地的神。因此，当阿摩司发表对外邦的审判时，从来都不提他们的神。因为神是全地独一的真神，神对外邦的审判，并不是以色列的神与外邦的神争战，而是神对全地的管理。\n「加略」（2节）是摩押的重要城市（耶四十八41）。\n主前733-732年，亚述王提革拉·毗列色三世发动第二次西征，征服了摩押，应验了阿摩司的预言。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神对北国的审判，与其他七国不同，不是降火烧灭宫殿（5节），而是「我必压你们，如同装满禾捆的车压物一样」（13节）。两年后，以色列发生了大地震，无人能够逃脱（14-15节），也无人能够抵挡（16节），应验了阿摩司的预言。\n今天，信徒如果像北国一样用自己所想象的金牛犊来代替神，不愿听悔改的信息，只想听祝福、安慰，维持虚假的属灵和平安；最终也会像北国一样，被神彻底压垮、「拆毁」（三15），才能「重新修造」（九11）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

קֵץ」原文谐音，神用双关语宣告：「夏天的果子」代表「我民以色列的结局到了，我必不再宽恕他们」（2节）。但是，虽然北国以色列的结局已经到了，国家即将灭亡，神却仍把「我民以色列」看作是自己的百姓，「不将雅各家灭绝净尽」（九8），所以「约瑟的余民」（五15）才有蒙神施恩的盼望——「寻求耶和华，就必存活」（五6）。\n[^2]： 百姓表面上谨守「月朔」（5节；民二十八11）和「安息日」（5节）的宗教形式，但心里却盼望这些节期赶紧结束，以便继续经营谋生。今天，许多信徒参加主日崇拜，也是人在心不在，心中着急讲道「几时过去」（5节），好赶快享受周末时光。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「雅各的荣耀」（7节）是双关语，既是指百姓的狂傲，也是指百姓真正的荣耀——神自己。神用讽刺的方法来起誓：以色列妄自尊大到什么地步，神就牢记他们的行为到什么地步。人诡诈的心思言行（5-6节），盼望主日崇拜「几时过去」（5节），神「必永远不忘」（7节），全部都会记在账上，到了时候必然清算。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 当北国的「穷乏人」（4节）、「困苦人」（4节）和「贫寒人」（6节）听到神谴责那些滥用权力、为富不仁的人时，心里一定大声叫好。不料，当神降下刑罚的时候，却没有只惩罚那些「吞吃穷乏人、使困苦人衰败的」，也没有只报应那些「用银子买贫寒人，用一双鞋换穷乏人，将坏了的麦子卖给人」（6节）的，而是用地震刑罚全民，「其上的居民」（8节）都不能幸免（二14-16）。\n因为在鉴察人心的神看来，百姓已经全然败坏，那些「穷乏人、困苦人、贫寒人」并没有更加高尚、敬虔；他们若掌握了财富、权力和地位，也会照样欺压其他的「穷乏人、困苦人、贫寒人」。因此，神并没有要人「头疼医头、脚疼医脚」地推行社会公义，北国已经用两百年的时间证明，人的生命若没有改变，任何改良或革命都不可能建立公平的政治、经济制度。神所要做的，是彻底地拆毁和重建，让弥赛亚君王来执掌王权，「在地上施行公平和公义」（耶二十三5），才能「使公义如江河滔滔」（五24）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「日头在午间落下」（9节），可能是预言正当北国的繁荣如日中天时，亚述突然来袭、比加王突然被杀（王下十五29-30），也可能是指日全食，或者是两者兼有的双关语。\n主前763年6月15日，中东地区发生过一次日全食。亚述帝国亚述但三世（Ashur-dan III，主前773-755年在位）第9年的年表记录了此事，成为确定古代中东历史事件绝对年份的关键依据，被称为亚述日全食（Assyrian eclipse）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「乃因不听耶和华的话」（11节），原文是「乃因缺乏耶和华的话」(英文ESV、NASB、KJV译本）。这「饥荒」（11节）不是「无饼、无水」（11节），而是「缺乏耶和华的话」；不是因为物质的贫乏，而是缺乏神话语的引导，人生看不到出路（12节）。主耶稣说：「我的食物就是遵行差我来者的旨意，做成他的工」（约四34），北国长期不顺服神的旨意，就是拒绝以神的话语为食物，所以神就收回了祂的话语。 「人活着不是单靠食物，乃是靠耶和华口里所出的一切话」（申八3），对于神的百姓来说，神话语的饥荒是最大的灾难，将导致属灵生命的死亡，正如「无饼、无水」将导致身体的死亡。所以，「以色列的结局到了」（2节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神明明说：「寻找，就寻见」（太七7），但这些神的百姓「寻求耶和华的话，却寻不着」，因为他们寻求的对象错了。百姓从东到西、从北到东，「往来奔跑」（12节），就是不肯向南回到神发出呼唤的耶路撒冷（一2）；因为他们并不是在寻求神，而是在寻求可以被自己操纵、利用的金牛犊（14节）。\n今天，许多信徒寻求神的态度，实际上也是寻求一个符合自己的想象、预期的金牛犊，而不是寻求必须舍己跟从、顺服的真神。所以他们「往来奔跑，寻求耶和华的话」（12节），甚至饥不择食，就是不肯回到圣经面前；结果所找到的，不是「体贴肉体」（罗八5）的「别的福音」（加一6），就是肤浅矫情的「心灵鸡汤」，却「寻不着」在圣经里自我启示的那位真神。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 今天，教会里也充满了自以为在属灵上美丽、刚强的「美貌的处女和少年的男子」（13节），他们「往来奔跑，寻求耶和华的话，却寻不着」（12节），无论是祷告的技巧、著名的讲员、还是「属灵的鸡汤」，都不能解决他们灵里的「干渴发昏」。因为他们寻求神的目的并不是为了顺服真理，而是为了得着福气，所以找到的只是似是而非、冒充真神的「撒马利亚牛犊」（14节），跟随的总是爱说「吉言」（王上二十二13）的假师傅，「他们轻轻忽忽地医治我百姓的损伤，说：平安了！平安了！其实没有平安」（耶六14）。因此，神「必命饥荒降在地上」（11节），使「这些人都必仆倒，永不再起来」（14节）。\n阿摩司书第8章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

「祭坛」（1节）指伯特利敬拜金牛犊的祭坛，是扰乱神见证的地方。「柱顶」（1节）和「门坎」（1节）一起被毁坏，表明敬拜金牛犊的庙宇在地震中从上到下完全毁灭。神的审判将从虚假的宗教开始，使虚假的「祭坛」成为审判的地方。\n先知早已警告：「不要往伯特利寻求……伯特利也必归于无有」（五5），百姓却坚持到伯特利去寻求金牛犊，结果是自取灭亡。今天，信徒若离弃「耶稣基督并祂钉十字架」（林前二2）、「去从别的福音」（加一6），在神的审判面前也是「无一人能逃避，无一人能逃脱」（1节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「挖透阴间、爬上天去」（2节），是用诗的语言，比喻当神「降祸不降福」（4节）的时候，人无论躲到哪里，都逃不掉神的审判和刑罚。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 百姓「虽被仇敌掳去」（4节），但神仍然与他们同在，然而却是审判中的同在。百姓无视神要他们回转的劝诫（四6、8、10），因此，神「必向他们定住眼目」（4节），要亲眼看到灾祸成为他们的定局。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「古实」（7节）位于埃及南部的努比亚。神并没有领古实人离开他们的原居地，而是领以色列人出埃及，但现在却看以色列人「如古实人」（7节），这表明：\n1) 有出埃及经历的百姓，与神有特殊的立约关系，但他们若不肯顺服圣约，就与没有出埃及经历的遥远的古实人没有什么两样。神的百姓不可能倚靠功德赚取神的恩典，但也不可能忽略责任而继续享用恩典，因为神说：「在地上万族中，我只认识你们；因此，我必追讨你们的一切罪孽」（三2）。\n2) 与古实人相比，以色列人并没有任何优越之处。古实人的黑皮肤不能变白，以色列人出埃及已经过了七百年，肉体的本相也没有任何变化。这证明神的怜悯、拯救，并不是因为百姓的所是、所能或所作，也不是因为他们向神有单纯的心，完全是出于神的主权和计划。\n「迦斐托」（7节）就是地中海东部的克里特岛，是以色列的宿敌非利士人的原居地。「吉珥」（7节）位于美索不达米亚，是以色列的宿敌亚兰人的原居地。神不但「领以色列人出埃及地」（7节），也「领非利士人出迦斐托，领亚兰人出吉珥」（7节），预先摆在迦南地的周围，准备将来作为管教百姓的工具。因此，万国都在神的管理之下，为要成就祂救恩的计划。\n神怎样「领亚兰人出吉珥」，也怎样使「亚兰人必被掳到吉珥」（一5；王下十六9）。如果百姓只把「出埃及」看作一个历史事件，而不肯活出立约之民的属灵实际，就不能见证出埃及的救赎意义；因此，神怎样「领以色列人出埃及地」，也照样使他们被掳到亚述。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「灾祸必追不上我们，也迎不着我们」（10节），指百姓自恃与神的关系特殊，盲目以为自己已经很敬虔，不必认罪悔改。今天，也有一些人自恃已蒙拯救，以为得救以后就不必再认罪。使徒约翰说：「我们若认自己的罪，神是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪，洗净我们一切的不义」（约壹一9），但有些假师傅却说：《约翰壹书》是写给诺斯底主义教派的，不是写给基督徒的。「主认识谁是祂的人」，「凡称呼主名的人总要离开不义」（提后二19）；当审判的时候，这些人也必要被筛子筛出来。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神清楚地宣告：「大卫倒塌的帐幕」只有神自己能够「重新修造」（11节；耶二十三5；结三十四16）。今天，许多人立志要重建「大卫倒塌的帐幕」，无论动机有多么属灵、愿望有多么美好，结局必然是失败的。因为神已经用以色列人一千五百年的失败和教会两千年的历史，让我们看得清清楚楚：人不可能建成神的国度，唯有弥赛亚基督才能「建立大卫倒塌的帐幕」（诗二7-9；七十二8-11；赛九7），从建立教会开始，直到带来千年国度。\n神亲自拆毁（1节），是为了亲自重建，「建立大卫倒塌的帐幕」（11节），祂的应许包括：\n1) 对地的恢复：使大自然被罪恶与死亡压抑的生产力爆发出来（13节），向那位执掌王权的弥赛亚君王献上贡品。当人类犯罪堕落以后，地为人的缘故受了咒诅（创三17；罗八20-22），人「必汗流满面才得糊口」（创三19）；而在千年国度里，这咒诅将被除去（赛十一6-9）。\n对人的恢复：使被掳的归回，「重修荒废的城邑」（14节），在应许之地重得供应和安息。人因着不公平、不公义（五7；六12）而荒废、糟蹋和失去的（四9；五11），将在神的公义、慈爱和信实里重新恢复，罪的恶果将被完全除去。\n永远的得救：百姓经过管教以后，一心寻求外邦偶像和金牛犊的人「都必仆倒，永不再起来」（八14）；但「照着拣选的恩典，还有所留的余数」（罗十一5），他们将被换上「新心」（结三十六26），彻底承认自己的全然败坏，学会完全信靠、顺服神。因此，他们将被「栽于本地」（15节），在安息里顺服神，不再从应许中失落、「从地上灭绝」（8节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

所以耶和华如此说、现今我回到耶路撒冷、仍施怜悯。我的殿必重建在其中、准绳必拉在耶路撒冷之上。这是万军之耶和华说的。 (6) 1:17 你要再宣告说、万军之耶和华如此说、我的城邑、必再丰盛发达。耶和华必再安慰锡安、拣选耶路撒冷。 1:18 我举目观看、见有四角。 1:19 我就问与我说话的天使说、这是甚么意思。他回答说、这是打散犹大、以色列、和耶路撒冷的角。 1:20 耶和华又指四个匠人给我看。\n1:21 我说、他们来作甚么呢。他说、这是打散犹大的角、使人不敢抬头。但这些匠人来威吓列国、打掉他们的角、就是举起打散犹大地的角。\n  人若「转向」（3节）神，神当然会「转向」人。但百姓「使脸刚硬过于磐石，不肯回头」（耶五3），不可能主动「转向」神，所以信实怜悯的神就主动「转向」祂所拣选的人。这样，神的义「惟有蒙拣选的人得着了；其余的就成了顽梗不化的」（罗十一7）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「回头」（4节）原文和「转向」是同一个词。人若要「转向」神，就要「回头离开你们的恶道恶行」，两者合而为一：人不可能「转向」神，却不必「回头」离开恶道恶行；也不可能「回头」离开恶道恶行，却不必「转向」神。\n「从前的先知呼叫他们」（4节），指耶利米、以西结等先知都曾反复劝勉百姓「回头」（耶十八11；二十五5；三十五15；结十四6；十八30），但「他们却不听，也不顺从」（4节）。对于已经「死在过犯罪恶之中」（弗二1）的天然人，虽然有福音传给他们，但「他们却不听从，不侧耳而听」（耶七24、26；十一8；十七23；四十四5），直到神照着他们的行为施行报应的时候才能醒悟过来（6节）。但现在已经到了神重建的时候，所以神将自己负责「叫你们活过来」（弗二1），亲自带领新一代的百姓「回头」。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 百姓应当从历史中学到教训，让神的话语在心里有准确的地位。但人从来都不能从失败的历史中学到任何教训（七11-12），正如黑格尔（G. W. F. Hegel，1770-1831年）所说的：「我们从历史中学到的教训，就是我们从来没有从历史中学到教训。We learn from history that we do not learn from history」。因此，神要向先知启示八个异象，表明重建圣殿的工程不会倚靠不可靠的百姓，「不是倚靠势力，不是倚靠才能，乃是倚靠我的灵方能成事」（四6）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 耶利米预言犹大将要被掳「七十年」（12节；耶二十五11）。如果从主前597年约雅斤王被掳（王下二十四12）开始算，此时已经过了78年；如果从主前586年圣殿被毁开始算，此时已经过了67年。因此，现在已经到了神重新「安慰锡安，拣选耶路撒冷」（17节）的时候了。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「火热」（14节）原文是「狂热、热心、嫉妒」，与「忌邪」（出二十5）的神和耶和华的「热心」（赛九7）字根相同，用拟人的方法表达神丰盛的爱和强烈的情感。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神一直与祂的百姓同行，已经「回到耶路撒冷」（16节），但人心只有真正「转向」神、完全地顺服在神的权柄下，才能让神在我们身上自由地做成祂所要做的工。神在八十多年后，再次借着先知玛拉基呼吁「你们要转向我，我就转向你们」（玛三7）。 天使所说的「不施怜悯」（12节）原文是单数，但神所说的「仍施怜悯」（16节）原文却是复数，表明神将对自己的百姓多方施行怜悯。\n撒迦利亚书第1章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":239,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/027_Daniel/Daniel_01/","title":"01 但一章","section":"Daniel","content":"但以理书\n1:1 犹大王约雅敬在位第三年、巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒来到耶路撒冷、将城围困。\n1:2 主将犹大王约雅敬、并　神殿中器皿的几分交付他手、他就把这器皿带到示拿地、收入他神的庙里、放在他神的库中。\n1:3 王吩咐太监长亚施毗拿、从以色列人的宗室和贵胄中、带进几个人来、 1:4 就是年少没有残疾、相貌俊美、通达各样学问、知识聪明俱备、足能侍立在王宫里的、要教他们迦勒底的文字言语。\n1:5 王派定将自己所用的膳、和所饮的酒、每日赐他们一分、养他们三年。满了三年、好叫他们在王面前侍立。\n1:6 他们中间有犹大族的人、但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅。 1:7 太监长给他们起名、称但以理为伯提沙撒、称哈拿尼雅为沙得拉、称米沙利为米煞、称亚撒利雅为亚伯尼歌。\n1:8 但以理却立志、不以王的膳、和王所饮的酒、玷污自己、所以求太监长容他不玷污自己。\n1:9 神使但以理在太监长眼前蒙恩惠、受怜悯。 1:10 太监长对但以理说、我惧怕我主我王、他已经派定你们的饮食。倘若他见你们的面貌、比你们同岁的少年人肌瘦、怎么好呢、这样、你们就使我的头在王那里难保。\n1:11 但以理对太监长所派管理但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅的委办说、 1:12 求你试试仆人们十天、给我们素菜吃、白水喝、 1:13 然后看看我们的面貌、和用王膳那少年人的面貌。就照你所看的待仆人吧。\n1:14 委办便允准他们这件事、试看他们十天。\n1:15 过了十天、见他们的面貌、比用王膳的一切少年人更加俊美肥胖。\n1:16 于是委办撤去派他们用的膳、饮的酒、给他们素菜吃。\n1:17 这四个少年人、　神在各样文字学问上、〔学问原文作智慧〕赐给他们聪明知识。但以理又明白各样的异象和梦兆。\n1:18 尼布甲尼撒王预定带进少年人来的日期满了、太监长就把他们带到王面前。\n1:19 王与他们谈论、见少年人中、无一人能比但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅、所以留他们在王面前侍立。\n1:20 王考问他们一切事、就见他们的智慧聪明、比通国的术士、和用法术的、胜过十倍。\n1:21 到古列王元年、但以理还在。\n"},{"id":240,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/028_Hosea/Hosea_01/","title":"01 何一章","section":"Hosea","content":"何西阿书\n1:1 当乌西雅、约坦、亚哈斯、希西家、作犹大王、约阿施的儿子耶罗波安作以色列王的时候、耶和华的话临到备利的儿子何西阿。\n1:2 耶和华初次与何西阿说话、对他说、你去娶淫妇为妻、也收那从淫乱所生的儿女、因为这地大行淫乱、离弃耶和华。\n1:3 于是何西阿去娶了滴拉音的女儿歌篾。 这妇人怀孕、给他生了一个儿子。\n1:4 耶和华对何西阿说、给他起名叫耶斯列、因为再过片时、我必讨耶户家在耶斯列杀人流血的罪、也必使以色列家的国灭绝。\n1:5 到那日、我必在耶斯列平原折断以色列的弓。\n1:6 歌篾又怀孕生了一个女儿、耶和华对何西阿说、给他起名叫罗路哈玛、〔就是不蒙怜悯的意思〕因为我必不再怜悯以色列家、决不赦免他们。\n1:7 我却要怜悯犹大家、使他们靠耶和华他们的　神得救、不使他们靠弓、刀、争战、马匹、与马兵得救。\n1:8 歌篾给罗路哈玛断奶以后、又怀孕生了一个儿子。\n1:9 耶和华说、给他起名叫罗阿米、〔就是非我民的意思〕因为你们不作我的子民、我也不作你们的　神。\n1:10 然而以色列的人数必如海沙、不可量、不可数。 从前在甚么地方对他们说、你们不是我的子民、将来在那里必对他们说、你们是永生　神的儿子。\n1:11 犹大人和以色列人必一同聚集、为自己立一个首领、从这地上去、〔或作从被掳之地上来〕因为耶斯列的日子必为大日。 (1)\n  南北两国分裂之后屡有纷争。北国后来曾经联合亚兰攻打南国，南国向亚述求援，导致亚述灭了亚兰（王下十六5-9），掳掠了北国（王下十五29）。但神却预言「犹大人和以色列人必一同聚集」（11节），十二支派将重新「在以色列山上成为一国」（结三十七22）。「在人这是不能的，在神凡事都能」（太十九26）。\n何西阿书第1章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":241,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/102_Mark/Mark_01/","title":"01 可一章","section":"Mark","content":"马可福音\n"},{"id":242,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/035_Habakkuk/Habakkuk_01/","title":"01 哈一章","section":"Habakkuk","content":"哈巴谷书\n哈巴谷的每一个抱怨听起来都很有道理：先是抱怨神不管教（2节），接着又抱怨神派错误的人执行管教（13节）；先是抱怨神看着百姓的奸恶而不理（3节），接着又抱怨神看着外邦人的诡诈而不理（13节）；先是抱怨神做得太少（2-4节），接着又抱怨神做得太多（13-17节）。我们的祷告也常常这样百般挑剔、而且道理十足；不管神怎么做，我们都不会满意，除非神完全按照我们的意思去做、完全符合我们的神学观点。这是哈巴谷的难处，也是今天每一个信徒的难处。\n1:1 先知哈巴谷所得的默示。\n1:2 他说、耶和华阿、我呼求你、你不应允、要到几时呢。我因强暴哀求你、你还不拯救。\n1:3 你为何使我看见罪孽。你为何看着奸恶而不理呢。毁灭和强暴在我面前。又起了争端和相斗的事。\n1:4 因此律法放松、公理也不显明。恶人围困义人。所以公理显然颠倒。 (1)\n1:5 耶和华说、你们要向列国中观看、大大惊奇。因为在你们的时候、我行一件事、虽有人告诉你们、你们总是不信。 (2)\n1:6 我必兴起迦勒底人、就是那残忍暴躁之民、通行遍地、占据那不属自己的住处。\n1:7 他威武可畏。判断和势力、都任意发出。\n1:8 他的马比豹更快、比晚上的豺狼更猛。马兵踊跃争先、都从远方而来。他们飞跑如鹰抓食。 1:9 都为行强暴而来。定住脸面向前、将掳掠的人聚集、多如尘沙。\n1:10 他们讥诮君王、笑话首领、嗤笑一切保障、筑垒攻取。\n1:11 他以自己的势力为神、像风猛然扫过、显为有罪。 (3)\n1:12 耶和华我的　神、我的圣者阿、你不是从亘古而有么。我们必不至死。耶和华阿、你派定他为要刑罚人。磐石阿、你设立他为要惩治人。\n1:13 你眼目清洁不看邪僻、不看奸恶。行诡诈的、你为何看着不理呢。恶人吞灭比自己公义的、你为何静默不语呢。 (4)\n1:14 你为何使人如海中的鱼、又如没有管辖的爬物呢。\n1:15 他用钩钩住、用网捕获、用拉网聚集他们。因此、他欢喜快乐。\n1:16 就向网献祭、向网烧香、因他由此得肥美的分、和富裕的食物。\n1:17 他岂可屡次倒空网罗、将列国的人时常杀戮、毫不顾惜呢。 (5) (6)\n  2-4节是哈巴谷的第一个问题：神为什么对百姓的罪恶坐视不管? 世人最喜欢这样控告神，把一切的责任都推给神，觉得自己比神还要公义、慈爱；信徒也常常这样质疑神，因为人的头脑都同样有限。但神「嗤笑」（诗二4）世人的狂妄，却耐心地回答先知的问题，因为祂乐意向自己的百姓启示真理，所以「这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透」（林前二14）。\n3-4节所描述的，不是外邦人的社会黑暗，而是神百姓的全然败坏。先知无法理解的是，公义的神竟然「看着奸恶而不理」（3节）；他为了神的公义和国度祷告，而神竟然迟迟「不应允」（2节）、「不拯救」（2节）！\n此时可能是南国犹大约雅敬作王的时候。在他之前，神兴起了南国最敬虔的约西亚王。但神兴起约西亚并不是为了复兴犹大，而是要人承认自己的全然败坏：连最敬虔的约西亚王都不能带起百姓真正的复兴，证明人已经「死在过犯罪恶之中」（弗二1），完全丧失了倚靠自己改善、复兴的能力，因此，应当彻底弃绝肉体，转而接受神的拆毁（王下二十三27）和重建（摩九11），信服新约救赎之道（耶三十一31、33）。\n属灵领袖的好榜样并不能真正改变人心，因为百姓并不是跟从神，而是跟从人。所以神说：「犹大还不一心归向我，不过是假意归我」（耶三10）。祂不但「看着奸恶而不理」，实际上，正是神主动取走了百姓属灵复兴的领袖约西亚（王下二十三29），把掩盖在表面复兴之下的「罪孽、奸恶、毁灭和强暴」（3节）全部暴露出来。\n今天，当我们觉得神「看着奸恶而不理」的时候，正确的态度不是质疑神，而是靠着圣灵寻求神的心意。神是乐意启示自己的神，祂允许先知提出质疑，借着人的问题发表祂的救赎心意；神也允许我们发出疑问，借着人的困惑引导我们走出自己和眼见，最终也像哈巴谷一样，在神里面「欢欣、喜乐」（三18）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n In Act 13:40-41 the Apostle Paul ended his sermon in the synagogue at Antioch, Pisidia, by quoting Hab 1:5. [Believer\u0026rsquo;s Bible] Act 13:40-41 (KJV)\n(40) Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;\n(41) Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 5-11节是神对先知的第一次回答：神将借着迦勒底人惩罚犹大。\n当哈巴谷埋头关注国中的败坏、义正词严地质问神的时候，神却要他抬头「向列国中观看」（5节）神的工作：神必从遥远的东方「兴起迦勒底人，就是那残忍暴躁之民」（6节），管教陷在罪中的百姓。实际上，神在一百多年前亚哈斯、希西家王的时候，就已经安排好要「行一件事」（5节），并且借着先知弥迦和以赛亚宣告：神要用巴比伦掳走陷在罪中的百姓，好把他们炼净（弥四10；赛三十九6-7）。\n迦勒底人虽然被神用作管教的器皿，但他们「以自己的势力为神」（11节），并不敬畏真神，所以「显为有罪」（11节），将会因自己的罪遭到惩罚。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神并没有像哈巴谷所以为的「静默不语」（一3、13），祂不但对迦勒底人的罪恶明察秋毫，对犹大的罪恶也洞若观火（一13）。神洞察一切，祂使用迦勒底人来管教犹大，在先知看来是「恶人吞灭比自己公义的」（一13），但神「若究察罪孽，谁能站得住呢」（诗一百三十3），犹大和迦勒底人一样满了「强暴」（二8；一2）。因此，全地的人、包括哈巴谷在内，都不可自以为义，而应当在神面前「肃敬静默」（二20）、反省自己为什么落到管教里，因为「慈爱的人，祢以慈爱待他；完全的人，祢以完全待他。清洁的人，你以清洁待他；乖僻的人，祢以弯曲待他」（诗十八25-26）。 哈巴谷书第2章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神的第一个回答让先知大跌眼镜。先知看到国中「恶人围困义人」（4节），所以求神伸张公义、拯救义人（2节）；但神不但没有拯救义人，反而将使用「残忍暴躁之民」（6节）把恶人和义人连锅端。因此，这个回答不但没有解除哈巴谷的疑问，反而使他的问题更多了：12-17节是哈巴谷发出的第二个问题：神为什么使用恶人来惩罚义人？\n先知相信神是信实守约的神，所以祂所拣选的百姓「必不致死」（12节）。先知也承认神有权借着人的手来「刑罚人、惩治人」（12节），但他不明白「眼目清洁，不看邪僻，不看奸恶」（13节）的神，怎么会使用残暴诡诈、敬拜偶像的巴比伦人来惩罚百姓中的义人？在先知看来，这违反了神公义、圣洁的本性，神的做事方法与他的神学观点完全不一致。\n哈巴谷书第1章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n J.

弥一章","section":"Micah","content":"弥迦书\n《弥迦书》被放在《约拿书》之后，并非完全因为年代，而是因为圣灵所要发表的信息。因为神在《约拿书》中向尼尼微宣告审判，乃是为了限制亚述的扩张，带给南北两国四十年的繁荣，证明《弥迦书》所指控的「撒马利亚的伤痕无法医治，延及犹大和耶路撒冷我民的城门」（一9）。而神在《约拿书》中赦免尼尼微城，也是为了保存亚述作为审判的工具，等待百姓恶贯满盈之后，执行《弥迦书》中所宣告的对南北两国的审判。\n在《十二先知书》中，何西阿、约珥、阿摩司、俄巴底亚、约拿和弥迦生活在北国即将灭亡之前，那鸿、哈巴谷和西番雅生活在南国即将灭亡之前，哈该、撒迦利亚和玛拉基生活在犹大被掳回归以后。神在这三个多事之秋，密集地差派先知发表信息，启示祂永远的救赎计划。\n传统认为，《弥迦书》的作者是南国的先知弥迦。「弥迦」是「米迦」（士十八2）和「米该雅」（王上二十二8）的简短拼法，这个名字的意思是「有何神像祢」（七18）。这个名字非常贴切，因为本书正是向我们显明，没有任何一个假神、也没有任何人或团体能像神一样，一面毫不妥协地审判罪恶，一面坚定不移地怜悯罪人，在最黑暗的时候预备了永远的救恩（五2），使我们不能不发出赞美：「神啊，有何神像祢，赦免罪孽，饶恕祢产业之余民的罪过，不永远怀怒，喜爱施恩」（七18）？\n在这内忧外患之际，神兴起南国的以赛亚、弥迦和北国的何西阿发表预言，让百姓看到这一系列危机背后的属灵真相：面临所面临的国际压力，是神在管理人类的历史（一3-7），实现祂从前与以色列立约时警告过的咒诅（六1-5、13-16）。人只有认识到神是「普天下的主」（四13），祂「必在怒气和忿怒中向那不听从的列国施报」（五15），才能站在属灵的高处，看清历史的真相（林前二15）。\n但是，百姓的全然败坏并不能倚靠君王的改革来改变，弥迦所预言的刑罚延迟了一百多年之后，最终还是来到了：耶路撒冷和圣殿被毁（三12；七13；王下二十五9-10）；百姓被掳巴比伦（四10；王下二十五11）。而弥迦所预言的重建（七11），也在神的彻底拆毁之后逐一实现：弥赛亚已经降生于伯利恒（五2；路二4-7），祂必将带来国度的恢复（四1-8；七14-17；徒一6-7）。\n弥迦不是要借着改革或革命重振信仰与道德，而是指出百姓的罪恶和过犯（三8），宣告他们已经全然败坏，「好像夏天的果子已被收尽，又像摘了葡萄所剩下的，没有一挂可吃的」（七1），只能「仰望耶和华，要等候那救我的神」（七7）。而神的计划是彻底拆毁，「耶路撒冷必变为乱堆；这殿的山必像丛林的高处」（三12）；然后神才赐下弥赛亚作王（五2-5），重新建造（七11）。有了基督作王的生命，人才能满足圣约的要求：「行公义，好怜悯，存谦卑的心，与你的神同行」（六8）。\n1:1 当犹大王约坦、亚哈斯、希西家在位的时候、摩利沙人弥迦得耶和华的默示、论撒玛利亚和耶路撒冷。1\n1:2 万民哪、你们都要听。地和其上所有的、也都要侧耳而听。主耶和华从他的圣殿要见证你们的不是。\n1:3 看哪、耶和华出了他的居所、降临步行地的高处。2\n1:4 众山在他以下必消化、诸谷必崩裂、如蜡化在火中、如水冲下山坡。\n1:5 这都因雅各的罪过、以色列家的罪恶。雅各的罪过在哪里呢。岂不是在撒玛利亚么。犹大的丘坛在哪里呢。岂不是在耶路撒冷么。\n1:6 所以我必使撒玛利亚变为田野的乱堆、又作为种葡萄之处。也必将他的石头倒在谷中、露出根基来。\n1:7 他一切雕刻的偶像必被打碎。他所得的财物必被火烧、所有的偶像我必毁灭。因为是从妓女雇价所聚来的、后必归为妓女的雇价。\n1:8 先知说、因此我必大声哀号、赤脚露体而行。又要呼号如野狗、哀鸣如鸵鸟。3\n1:9 因为撒玛利亚的伤痕无法医治、延及犹大和耶路撒冷我民的城门。\n1:10 不要在迦特报告这事、总不要哭泣。我在伯亚弗拉滚于灰尘之中。\n1:11 沙斐的居民哪、你们要赤身蒙羞过去。撒南的居民不敢出来。伯以薛人的哀哭、使你们无处可站。\n1:12 玛律的居民、心甚忧急、切望得好处、因为灾祸从耶和华那里临到耶路撒冷的城门。\n1:13 拉吉的居民哪、要用快马套车。锡安民〔民原文作女子〕的罪、由你而起。以色列人的罪过、在你那里显出。\n1:14 犹大阿、你要将礼物送给摩利设迦特。亚革悉的众族、必用诡诈待以色列诸王。\n1:15 玛利沙的居民哪、我必使那夺取你的来到你这里。以色列的尊贵人〔原文作荣耀〕必到亚杜兰。\n1:16 犹大阿、要为你所喜爱的儿女剪除你的头发、使头光秃、要大大地光秃、如同秃鹰、因为他们都被掳去离开你。\n  在这三个王期间，亚述帝国在四十年的衰落之后重新崛起、对外扩张，给南北两国带来了极大的威胁。\n陷入偶像崇拜两百年的北国已经无法自拔，撒马利亚在20年内将被亚述攻取（王下十八9-11）。神使用亚述作祂「怒气的棍」（赛十5），打碎北国所敬拜的偶像、烧灭他们所倚靠的财物，一直到「露出根基来」（6节），神的百姓才有得恢复的盼望。\n南国犹大的属灵光景起起伏伏：「约坦行耶和华眼中看为正的事」（王下十五34），亚哈斯却「效法以色列诸王所行的，又照着耶和华从以色列人面前赶出的外邦人所行可憎的事，使他的儿子经火」（王下十六3），希西家又「行耶和华眼中看为正的事」（王下十八3）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「步行地的高处」（3节），原文是「践踏在地的背上」，象征神是全地的主宰。虽然此时的国际形势危机四起，但先知却提醒百姓注意：神始终「步行地的高处」，掌管人类的历史。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 弥迦的审判是出于神，而不是出于血气，因此，他不是只会骂人。神毫不妥协的审判，是出于坚定不移的爱；以神的心为心的先知，也怀着神对儿女的伤痛，「大声哀号」（8节）。今天，一些所谓「先知性」讲道，模仿先知的骂人风范，却不肯效法先知「赤脚露体而行」（8节），结果成了自以为义的情绪宣泄，只会败坏人，并不能使人得造就。真正的「惟用爱心说诚实话」（弗四15），乃是像保罗一样，「凡与你们有益的，我没有一样避讳不说的」（徒二十20）；也像弥迦一样，责备之中充满了「呼号如野狗，哀鸣如鸵鸟」（8节）的爱。

约拿已下到底舱、躺卧沉睡。\n1:6 船主到他那里对他说、你这沉睡的人哪、为何这样呢。 起来、求告你的神、或者神顾念我们、使我们不至灭亡。\n1:7 船上的人彼此说、来吧、我们掣签、看看这灾临到我们是因谁的缘故。 于是他们掣签、掣出约拿来。\n1:8 众人对他说、请你告诉我们、这灾临到我们是因谁的缘故。 你以何事为业。 你从那里来。 你是哪一国、属那一族的人。\n1:9 他说、我是希伯来人。 我敬畏耶和华、那创造沧海旱地之天上的　神。\n1:10 他们就大大惧怕、对他说、你作的是甚么事呢。 他们已经知道他躲避耶和华、因为他告诉了他们。\n1:11 他们问他说、我们当向你怎样行、使海浪平静呢。 这话是因海浪越发翻腾。\n1:12 他对他们说、你们将我抬起来、抛在海中、海就平静了。 我知道你们遭这大风、是因我的缘故。\n1:13 然而那些人竭力荡桨、要把船拢岸、却是不能。 因为海浪越发向他们翻腾。3\n1:14 他们便求告耶和华说、耶和华阿、我们恳求你、不要因这人的性命使我们死亡。 不要使流无辜血的罪归与我们。 因为你耶和华是随自己的意旨行事。4\n1:15 他们遂将约拿抬起、抛在海中、海的狂浪就平息了。5\n1:16 那些人便大大敬畏耶和华、向耶和华献祭、并且许愿。6\n1:17 耶和华安排一条大鱼吞了约拿、他在鱼腹中三日三夜。7\n  主耶稣开始传道时，不是用「耶稣爱你」来吸引人，而是宣告「天国近了，你们应当悔改」（太四17）！\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n [神的旨意] 古代远洋航行的船只很少，但约拿居然轻易就「遇见一只船，要往他施去」（3节），而且恰巧有空位；他竟然没有想想为什么这么巧，就和一船的外邦人「同往他施去躲避耶和华」（3节）。当我们像约拿一样体贴肉体的时候，也会「好像鸽子愚蠢无知」（何七11），傻傻地把「他施的船」当作是神所开的门路，结果饱尝风浪、枉费船价。\n神知道约拿不愿看到尼尼微得救、而是盼望亚述灭亡；正如约拿也知道神满有怜悯，必然会恩待悔改的尼尼微（四2）。约拿明白神的心意，也认识神的性情，但却体贴肉体的感情，不肯顺服神的旨意，所以「体贴肉体的，就是与神为仇；因为不服神的律法，也是不能服」（罗八7）。\n尽管如此，神并没有差遣天使、异象或其他的先知去做宣教士，而是坚持叫约拿去「向其中的居民呼喊」（1节）。因为神差遣约拿，并不是因为拯救尼尼微的任务非他莫属，而是为了让我们看见，神将怎样使「万事都互相效力」（罗八28），对付约拿的肉体、把他造就成甘心顺服的仆人。同样，神今天差遣我们履行大使命，也不是因为拯救世人的使命非我莫属，而是为了让我们与神同工，肉体不住地被对付，直到甘心背起自己的十字架跟随主。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 地中海沿岸的礁石比较多，水手在海上遇到风浪时，通常不愿把船拢岸，以免在风浪中触礁搁浅（徒二十七29）。现在他们却努力「要把船拢岸」（13节），是想把约拿送上岸去。这并非因为他们比不愿去尼尼微的约拿更有爱心，而是害怕得罪约拿的守护神。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神借着外邦人的口，宣告「耶和华是随自己的意旨行事」（14节），向我们启示了什么是自由：\nI 面对神的旨意，约拿有选择是否顺服的自由。他决定将神的话当作微风，结果经历了狂风，白白支付了不菲的「船价」（3节）。自由选择的结果使他发现，唯一正确的选择就是顺服神。\nII 面对风浪，水手们有选择怎样行动的自由。他们在惧怕中哀求各自的神，在慌张时尽力将货物抛掉，用掣签发现问题所在以后，又想用自己的方法处置约拿，免得得罪约拿的神。自由选择的结果使他们发现，唯一正确的选择是把约拿「抛在海中」。\nIII 面对人的自由，神也有自己的自由。祂并不阻止约拿上船，但绝不允许约拿逃到他施，也绝不允许约拿被顺利送上岸，而要把约拿抛在海中，经历死而复活。至高者的自由，绝不会因为人的自由而改变，因为「耶和华是随自己的意旨行事」。\nIV 因此，有智慧的人应当让自己的自由顺服神的自由，而不是坚持自己的自由，幻想宇宙的主宰会放弃祂的自由，来迁就自己的自由。真正的自由，不是自由地以卵击石，而是自由地避免以卵击石。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 在风浪面前，各人都把船上的「货物」往海里丢（5节）；但问题却不在于「货物」，而在于人。我们在人生的风浪面前，也常常在外面找原因，把难处归咎于各种「货物」。但真正的问题却不是船上的「货物」，而是那个「下到底舱，躺卧沉睡」（5节）的约拿，是那个藏在我们里面的肉体。这个肉体不肯把自己交在神的手中，不愿意顺服神。因此，神就会在环境里兴起「狂浪」（15节），直到我们不得不把里面的肉体「抬起，抛在海中」（15节），狂浪才能平息。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 船上的外邦人看见狂浪果然平息了，便大大敬畏神、敬拜神。有时候，虽然我们不肯顺服神，但神也能借着我们的肉体被「抛在海中」的经历，叫世人看到神的主权，因此「大大敬畏耶和华」（16节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 这条「大鱼」（17节）既是审判的象征，也是恩典的记号；既使约拿经历死亡、与一切隔绝，也使约拿得以存活、不至灭亡。对于约拿来说，「鱼腹」（17节）既是避难所，也是监牢，让他能在「阴间的深处」（二2）体验神的救恩，重新认识自己与神的关系（二4）。\n「三日三夜」（17节）不一定指七十二小时，可以是二十四小时的一整天，再加上前后两天的部分时间。在希伯来文化里，「三日三夜」是一个特别的成语，代表人彻底死透了。「三日三夜」也是苏美尔神话里灵魂去阴间的时间。\n这条大鱼并不是在约拿落水时张口接住约拿，而是在约拿「下到山根」（二6）、被「海草缠绕」（二5）的时候，从海底叼起约拿。约拿在这「三日三夜」里即使没有完全死亡，也是生不如死（二5-6），所以才有死里复活的感受。因此，主耶稣引这个神迹，作为祂受死、埋葬和复活的预表：「约拿三日三夜在大鱼肚腹中，人子也要这样三日三夜在地里头」（太十二40）。\n神是万有的主宰，祂不但差遣人（2节），也使风（4节）、大鱼（17节）、蓖麻（四6）、虫子（四7）和炎热的东风（四8）听命行事，让「万事都互相效力」（罗八28），成就祂救赎的旨意。而在神所使用的受造物当中，只有照着神形象被造的人最不顺服（3节）。但神要让约拿「在鱼腹中三日三夜」（17节），用祂复活的大能使约拿「真知道祂」（弗一17-23）。今天，神也会安排各种难处，让我们亲身经历神（伯四十二2-6），痛悔自己的罪（路十五21），认识到自己何等需要神的救恩（诗五十一1-3），最终使我们「成全完备，毫无缺欠」（雅一4）。\n约拿书逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

我必使灾祸临到人身上、使他们行走如同瞎眼的、因为得罪了我。他们的血、必倒出如灰尘、他们的肉、必抛弃如粪土。\n1:18 当耶和华发怒的日子、他们的金银不能救他们。他的忿怒如火、必烧灭全地、毁灭这地的一切居民、而且大大毁灭。\n  「西番雅」这个名字的意思是「耶和华隐藏、保护、珍爱」。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

那时、撒拉铁的儿子所罗巴伯和约撒答的儿子大祭司约书亚、并剩下的百姓、都听从耶和华他们　神的话和先知哈该奉耶和华他们　神差来所说的话。百姓也在耶和华面前存敬畏的心。\n1:13 耶和华的使者哈该奉耶和华差遣对百姓说、耶和华说、我与你们同在。\n1:14 耶和华激动犹大省长撒拉铁的儿子所罗巴伯、和约撒答的儿子大祭司约书亚、并剩下之百姓的心。他们就来为万军之耶和华他们　神的殿作工。 (6) (7)\n1:15 这是在大利乌王第二年、六月二十四日。\n  当时的百姓有许多既合理、又「属灵」的理由来拖延建殿：\n花费庞大搞「形象工程」值得吗？\n神看重的是人，而不是物质的殿，为什么不用建殿的钱先解决穷人的温饱急需呢？\n重建圣殿是出于古列王的人意（拉一2:3），还是神的旨意呢？\n让波斯王包办重建圣殿的材料费用（拉六3:5），岂不是把荣耀归给人了吗？\n波斯王关于重建的新诏书还没有下来（拉四21），神还没有开路，人为什么要走在神的前面呢？\n新殿的规模大不如前，能荣耀神吗（拉三12）？\n从主前586年圣殿被毁到主前520年只有66年，耶利米预言的70年到了吗？\n先知以西结所描述的圣殿，是神迹性地显给他看的（结四十1:2），人为什么要伸出肉体的手来帮神的忙呢？\n当人体贴自己、落在眼见里的时候，里面的黑暗就开始了。这九年来，百姓用各种理由把神的旨意撇在一边，先解决自己生活的需要，结果却什么都做不成；不管怎么殷勤努力，总是落到缺乏里（6节；何四10；弥六15）。神并没有应许人心想事成，但与神立约的以色列人若是长期落在缺乏里，必定是与神的关系出了问题（申二十八11-12、30、33、38:40）。因此，现在神命令：不要找理由了！「你们要省察自己的行为」（5节），「不要为自己积攒财宝在地上」（太六19）；而要省察自己是否准确地活在神面前，是否切实地让神「在凡事上居首位」（西一18）？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神在圣殿停工的九年中，一直没有说话，而是让百姓在这九年中经历缺乏，反省落到缺乏里的原因。神并不看重物质的殿，所以祂允许圣殿两次被毁；神所看重的是这殿所表明的属灵见证，所以神两次命令「你们要省察自己的行为」（5、7节），让建造者省察自己是否活出了属灵建造的目的。这九年的耽误，让百姓认识到重建工程乃是属灵的争战，出于神的工作，只能倚靠神自己来成就；这九年的缺乏，把百姓催逼到神面前，凭信心全然倚靠神、支取神，见证了「万有都是本于祂，倚靠祂，归于祂」（罗十一36）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「我就因此喜乐」（8节），原文是「我就因此悦纳」。神所悦纳的不是圣殿，而是人的信靠、顺服。人手的工作并不能使神「得荣耀」（8节），使神「得荣耀」的是祂的旨意「行在地上，如同行在天上」（太六10）。我们若没有里面的信靠和顺服，无论奉献、事奉和敬拜有多么光鲜亮丽，都不能荣耀神。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「顾」（9节）原文是「奔跑」，形容百姓对建造自己房子的热诚。百姓一心为自己的生活奔忙，却任由神的见证「荒凉」（9节）。今天，许多信徒也是整天为事业奔忙，把自己的需要和追求放在神的旨意之上，结果也是「你们盼望多得，所得的却少，你们收到家中，我就吹去」（9节）。因为神不允许百姓的心思长久地停留在地上，必然会兴起各种环境来对付他们，让祂所拣选的人体会到：「若不是耶和华建造房屋，建造的人就枉然劳力」（ 诗一百二十七1）。\n「省察」（5、7节）原文也译为「追想」（二15、18），在短短的哈该书中一共出现了五次。今天，我们也常常因为体贴自己的肉体，不肯让基督「在凡事上居首位」（西一18），所以找出种种貌似合理、属灵的理由来推脱，神也照样命令我们：不要再找借口了！「你们要省察自己的行为」（7节），「因为你的财宝在哪里，你的心也在那里」（太六21）；因此，「我们当深深考察自己的行为，再归向耶和华」（哀三40）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「天就不降甘露」（10节），是律法对悖逆百姓的咒诅（利二十六19；申二十八23），阿摩司在被掳前也提醒过他们（摩四7），但百姓竟然过了九年还没有苏醒过来，白白受苦。\n第11节的「干旱 חֹרֶב」原文与第4、9节的「荒凉 חָרֵב」的字根相同、发音相近，是双关语。 百姓在困苦缺乏中糊里糊涂地过了九年，现在神清清楚楚地告诉百姓，这些「干旱」都是祂的作为，而且是「为你们的缘故」（10节）。百姓若用任何人、事、物来取代神，神必然会击打偶像；百姓若把神的赐福放在神的见证和心意之上，神必然会挪去祝福（利二十六19；申二十八23）。\n今天，许多信徒也以为神总是赐福、施恩，「超过我们所求所想的」（弗三20）。岂不知为了我们的缘故，神也会让「干旱」临到我们「一切劳碌得来的」（11节），也是「超过我们所求所想的」，好让我们从属灵的昏暗中醒转。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 此时正是农忙季节，但百姓却没有以工作忙为理由来推脱，而是立刻以行动来悔改（14:15节）。以赛亚、耶利米讲了几十年（赛六9:11；耶二十五3），百姓却仍不悔改；哈该讲道之后23天，重建工程就恢复了。这并不是因为哈该讲道的水平更高，而是因为神重建百姓的时候已经到了，所以「耶和华激动」（14节）人心。神改变人心的工作可以等70年，也可以只等23天，都是在祂的时间、按祂的方式、为祂自己的目的。神的仆人所注意的应该是忠心地献上自己（罗十二1）、「与神同工」（林前三9），而要把工作的果效完全交给神；不必因为没有看见果效而自怨自艾，也不可因为看见果效而自高自大。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 上帝降下干旱，这样做的目的是要完成祂的心愿-完成建圣殿的工作。要不是神借着先知说的话，可能百姓还不清楚自然灾害背后的原因。那么，上帝对我们的心意是什么呢？\n哈该书第1章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

神向百姓说话，不会只说一面的话，而是会照着祂的时间，将祂的心意完全地向人显明，把人带进祂永远的旨意里。《那鸿书》并不是向已经灭亡的尼尼微说话，而是向当时和今天神的百姓说话，让我们借着尼尼微的结局来认识祂公义的性情：「耶和华是忌邪施报的神。耶和华施报大有忿怒；向祂的敌人施报，向祂的仇敌怀怒」（2节）。本书几乎全部都是激情洋溢的优美诗歌，提醒我们：神不是遥远冷漠、给宇宙上了发条就不再理会的自然神，祂「察看世人」（诗十一4），顾念祂所创造的世界，绝对不允许罪恶在地上泛滥。因此，在尼尼微所代表的一切抵挡神的势力的面前，我们可以耐心等候，因为神必然报应，并且「复兴雅各的荣华，好像以色列的荣华一样」（二2），在管教之后重新建立我们。\n1:1

「与巴比伦人同住的锡安民哪，应当逃脱」（7节），可译为「住在巴比伦的居民哪，应当逃到锡安」（英文ESV译本）。当时还有许多犹太人留在巴比伦，生活安逸富足，不愿回到耶路撒冷面对艰难的生活。神呼唤他们「从北方之地逃回」（6节）到没有城墙保护的耶路撒冷（4节），因为神的刑罚即将临到巴比伦。先知发出这个预言之后，巴比伦城因反叛波斯，被大流士王围城二十个月后攻陷，城内贵冑惨遭屠杀，凡没有听从先知而「逃脱」（7节）的百姓，也跟着遭受池鱼之殃。那时，百姓才相信撒迦利亚确实是神所差遣的先知（9节）。\n上帝也要我们逃脱这个世界安逸的生活，回到上帝那里。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「住在你中间」（10、11节），指神借着会幕（出二十九45）、圣殿（王上六13）和基督（赛七14；太一23），与祂的百姓同在，全世界蒙拣选的人都要成为祂立约的百姓（11节）。到那时，耶路撒冷确实「好像无城墙的乡村」（4节），百姓不再需要争战（赛二4；弥四3）。这应许要到千年国度（结四十三9）和新天新地里才能完全实现（ 启二十一3）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":250,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/027_Daniel/Daniel_02/","title":"02 但二章","section":"Daniel","content":"但以理书\n2:1 尼布甲尼撒在位第二年、他作了梦、心里烦乱、不能睡觉。\n2:2 王吩咐人将术士、用法术的、行邪术的、和迦勒底人召来、要他们将王的梦告诉王。他们就来站在王前。 2:3 王对他们说、我作了一梦、心里烦乱、要知道这是甚么梦。\n2:4 迦勒底人、用亚兰的言语对王说、愿王万岁、请将那梦告诉仆人、仆人就可以讲解。\n2:5 王回答迦勒底人说、梦我已经忘了、〔或作我已定命八节同〕你们若不将梦和梦的讲解告诉我、就必被凌迟、你们的房屋必成为粪堆。\n2:6 你们若将梦和梦的讲解告诉我、就必从我这里得赠品、和赏赐、并大尊荣。现在你们要将梦和梦的讲解告诉我。\n2:7 他们第二次对王说、请王将梦告诉仆人、仆人就可以讲解。\n2:8 王回答说、我准知道你们是故意迟延、因为你们知道那梦我已经忘了。 2:9 你们若不将梦告诉我、只有一法待你们、因为你们预备了谎言乱语向我说、要等候时势改变。现在你们要将梦告诉我、因我知道你们能将梦的讲解告诉我。\n2:10 迦勒底人在王面前回答说、世上没有人能将王所问的事说出来、因为没有君王、大臣、掌权的、向术士、或用法术的、或迦勒底人、问过这样的事。\n2:11 王所问的事甚难、除了不与世人同居的神明、没有人在王面前能说出来。\n2:12 因此王气忿忿的大发烈怒、吩咐灭绝巴比伦所有的哲士。 2:13 于是命令发出、哲士将要见杀、人就寻找但以理和他的同伴、要杀他们。\n2:14 王的护卫长亚略出来、要杀巴比伦的哲士、但以理就用婉言回答他、 2:15 向王的护卫长亚略说、王的命令为何这样紧急呢。亚略就将情节告诉但以理。\n2:16 但以理遂进去求王宽限、就可以将梦的讲解告诉王。1\n2:17 但以理回到他的居所、将这事告诉他的同伴哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅、 2:18 要他们祈求天上的　神施怜悯、将这奥秘的事指明、免得但以理和他的同伴、与巴比伦其余的哲士、一同灭亡。\n2:19 这奥秘的事、就在夜间异象中、给但以理显明。但以理便称颂天上的　神。 2:20 但以理说、　神的名是应当称颂的、从亘古直到永远、因为智慧能力都属乎他。\n2:21 他改变时候、日期、废王、立王、将智慧赐与智慧人、将知识赐与聪明人。 2:22 他显明深奥隐秘的事、知道暗中所有的、光明也与他同居。\n2:23 我列祖的　神阿、我感谢你、赞美你、因你将智慧才能赐给我。允准我们所求的、把王的事给我们指明。\n2:24 于是但以理进去见亚略、就是王所派灭绝巴比伦哲士的、对他说、不要灭绝巴比伦的哲士、求你领我到王面前、我要将梦的讲解告诉王。\n2:25 亚略就急忙将但以理领到王面前、对王说、我在被掳的犹大人中遇见一人、他能将梦的讲解告诉王。\n2:26 王问称为伯提沙撒的但以理说、你能将我所作的梦、和梦的讲解、告诉我么。\n2:27 但以理在王面前回答说、王所问的那奥秘事、哲士、用法术的、术士、观兆的、都不能告诉王。 2:28 只有一位在天上的　神、能显明奥秘的事他已将日后必有的事、指示尼布甲尼撒王。你的梦、和你在床上脑中的异象是这样。\n2:29 王阿、你在床上想到后来的事、那显明奥秘事的主、把将来必有的事指示你。 2:30 至于那奥秘的事显明给我、并非因我的智慧胜过一切活人、乃为使王知道梦的讲解、和心里的思念。\n2:31 王阿、你梦见一个大像、这像甚高、极其光耀、站在你面前、形状甚是可怕。 2:32 这像的头是精金的、胸膛和膀臂是银的、肚腹和腰是铜的、 2:33 腿是铁的、脚是半铁半泥的。 2:34 你观看、见有一块非人手凿出来的石头、打在这像半铁半泥的脚上、把脚砸碎、 2:35 于是金、银、铜、铁、泥、都一同砸得粉碎、成如夏天禾场上的糠秕、被风吹散、无处可寻。打碎这像的石头、变成一座大山、充满天下。\n2:36 这就是那梦、我们在王面前要讲解那梦。 2:37 王阿、你是诸王之王、天上的　神已将国度、权柄、能力、尊荣、都赐给你。 2:38 凡世人所住之地的走兽、并天空的飞鸟、他都交付你手、使你掌管这一切、你就是那金头。 2:39 在你以后必另兴一国、不及于你。又有第三国、就是铜的、必掌管天下。 2:40 第四国、必坚壮如铁、铁能打碎克制百物、又能压碎一切、那国也必打碎压制列国。\n2:41 你既见像的脚和脚指头、一半是窑匠的泥、一半是铁、那国将来也必分开。你既见铁与泥搀杂、那国也必有铁的力量。 2:42 那脚指头、既是半铁半泥、那国也必半强半弱。 2:43 你既见铁与泥搀杂、那国民也必与各种人搀杂、却不能彼此相合、正如铁与泥不能相合一样。\n2:44 当那列王在位的时候、天上的　神必另立一国、永不败坏、也不归别国的人、却要打碎灭绝那一切国、这国必存到永远。\n2:45 你既看见非人手凿出来的一块石头、从山而出、打碎金、银、铜、铁、泥、那就是至大的　神把后来必有的事给王指明。这梦准是这样、这讲解也是确实的。\n2:46 当时尼布甲尼撒王、俯伏在地、向但以理下拜、并且吩咐人给他奉上供物和香品。\n2:47 王对但以理说、你既能显明这奥秘的事、你们的　神、诚然是万　神之　神、万王之主、又是显明奥秘事的。\n2:48 于是王高抬但以理、赏赐他许多上等礼物、派他管理巴比伦全省、又立他为总理、掌管巴比伦的一切哲士。\n2:49 但以理求王、王就派沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌、管理巴比伦省的事务、只是但以理常在朝中侍立。\n  今天，当我们在世上打拼奋斗的时候，岂不常常也是「人在家中坐、祸从天上来」吗？多少最风光的职业，一夜就成为高危职业；多少有前途的行业，一夜就陷入全面危机。因为这个世界从来都不爱那些爱它的人。但是，但以理在震惊和压力之下却非常镇定，因为他知道，对于一个属神的人，无论神安排自己从事哪个职业，都有祂的美意。因此，但以理的要求与迦勒底人不同，哲士是祈求王把梦告诉他们（7节），但以理却是要求宽限时间（16节），好回去「祈求天上的神施怜悯，将这奥秘的事指明」（18节）。\n但以理书第2章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

He wanted to get alone in order to gain God\u0026rsquo;s perspective. This is a most important principle for believers today as well. Whether we call it our \u0026ldquo;quiet time,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;devotions,\u0026rdquo; or by some other term, daily communion with God is crucial for every Christian.

Habakkuk 2:3\nBeware of the danger of relaxation spiritually. “What shall I render unto the LORD?” said the Psalmist, “I will take the cup of salvation.” We are apt to look for satisfaction in ourselves—“Now I have got the thing; now I am entirely sanctified; now I can endure.” Instantly we are on the road to ruin. Our reach must exceed our grasp. “Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect.”\nThe vision of God is the source of patience, because it imparts a moral inspiration. A man with the vision of God is not devoted to a cause or to any particular issue; he is devoted to God Himself. You always know when the vision is of God because of the inspiration that comes with it.\nIf we have only what we have experienced, we have nothing; if we have the inspiration of the vision of God, we have more than we can experience.\nChambers, Oswald. My Utmost for His Highest, Classic Edition (p. 151). Discovery House. Kindle Edition.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神做工的目的不是为了解决事，而是为了得着人。人肉体的倾向，对神必成就的事，总是希望可以再等等；而对于自己所要的事，却总是希望不要「迟延」。因此，我们的祷告一定要注意不要教神做什么、怎么做、何时做，而要「肃敬静默」（20节）地听神要我们做什么。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n A. J. Pollock says that this verse refers to the hope of the Jew—Christ\u0026rsquo;s coming to earth to subdue His enemies, take out of His kingdom all things that offend, and set up His glorious reign, making Israel the head of the nations because He will be at the head of the Jewish nation. When verse 3 is quoted in Heb_10:37, the \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rdquo; (i.e., the vision) becomes \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rdquo; (i.e., the Lord), who will surely come and will not tarry. The NT context refers to the hope of the Christian—the Rapture of the church. [Believer\u0026rsquo;s Bible]\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 人被神称为义的唯一途径，就是效法「亚伯拉罕信神，这就算为他的义」（罗四3；创十五6）。因此，「义人」「不是有自己因律法而得的义，乃是有信基督的义，就是因信神而来的义」（腓三9）。\n神使用迦勒底人来管教犹大，并不是因为他们比犹大更加谦卑、正直，也不是让他们来教导犹大人怎样做「好人」，更不是让他们把犹大改造成一个「好社会」，而是为了把百姓带到困苦绝望、无可倚靠的地步，好让祂所拣选的「义人因信得生」，重新回到祂的权柄下。因此，虽然受管教的犹大亡国了，但并不是所有的百姓都要灭亡，那些忠心等候神（3节）的人必能在「自高自大，心不正直」（4节）的迦勒底人中间得着活路，因为「困苦的百姓，祢必拯救；高傲的眼目，祢必使他降卑」（诗十八27）。\n现今，俄罗斯与乌克兰的战争也让我们重新回到祂的权柄下。\n新约多次引用第4节说明因信称义的真理（罗一17；加三11；来十38-39）。希伯来文的「信 אֱמוּנָה」原文意思是「坚固、忠诚、坚定不移、稳固」，而希腊文的「信 πίστις」原文意思是「坚信、相信、忠贞、忠实」。因此，「信心」和「忠心」在英文里干脆就是同一个词（faith），「信心」也意味着「忠心」，真正的「信心」是对神持续的「忠心」，而不是只有刹那间的相信。所以，主耶稣反复宣告：「惟有忍耐到底的必然得救」（太十22；二十四13；可十三13）。\nMat 10:22 (KJV)\nAnd ye shall be hated of all men for my name\u0026rsquo;s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.\n马太福音‬10:22 (和合本)\n并且你们要为我的名被众人恨恶。惟有忍耐到底的必然得救。\nMat 24:13 (KJV) But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\n‪‪马太福音‬24:13 (和合本) 惟有忍耐到底的，必然得救。\nMar 13:13 (KJV) And ye shall be hated of all men for my name\u0026rsquo;s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\n‪马可福音‬13:13 (和合本)\n并且你们要为我的名被众人恨恶。惟有忍耐到底的，必然得救。”\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hab 2:4 has the distinction of being quoted three times in the NT.\nRom 1:17 (KJV)\nFor therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.\nGal 3:11 (KJV)\nBut that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.\nHeb 10:38 (KJV)\nNow the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.\n[Believer\u0026rsquo;s Bible] Joh 3:36 (KJV)\nHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\n[John MacArthur\u0026rsquo;s The Study Bible]\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 大约七十年后，玛代和波斯联军于主前539年攻陷巴比伦，消灭了迦勒底人的王朝。本书的预言是主前605年尼布甲尼撒二世在迦基米施战役（Battle of Carchemish）中打败亚述和埃及联军 之前，新巴比伦帝国的国势还没有到达巅峰，神就宣告了她在七十年后的末日。因此，当这个预言应验的时候，将让「认识耶和华荣耀的知识要充满遍地，好像水充满洋海一般」（14节），使全地的人都能认识神、归荣耀给祂（拉一2）。\n14节引自赛十一9，最终将在千年国度里应验。\nBut a day is coming when the one true God will be globally acknowledged. This glorious time is predicted in a deservedly famous poetic comparison: \u0026ldquo;For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea\u0026rdquo; (2:14). [Believer\u0026rsquo;s Bible] 不要为当今的时局纠结；不要为自己的处境焦虑；不要为不义愤愤不平。上帝的作为有祂的时间。\n(附：上帝说，伸冤在我，我必报应！) 罗马书 12:19 3 (和合本)\n亲爱的弟兄，不要自己伸冤，宁可让步，听凭主怒（或译：让人发怒）；因为经上记着：「主说：『伸冤在我，我必报应。』\n\u0026ldquo;Vengeance is Mine, I will repay.\u0026rdquo;\n不要问为什么上帝把我放在这里。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「肃敬静默」（20节）原文是「静默」，人在闭嘴以后，才能看得清楚、想得明白；哈巴谷安静下来思想神的话，才明白自己眼中的「义人」和「恶人」，在神眼中都是全然败坏的罪人，所以整个心思都改变了。他不再争辩、不再替神出主意，而是甘心接受神的彻底拆毁，进入第三章的敬拜颂赞。「肃敬静默」，也是每一个信徒在敬拜、祷告时所应有的态度。\n哈巴谷书第2章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

在乌西雅王执政的四十年期间，南国和北国一样繁荣稳定，但物质的丰富和环境的安稳，并没有使百姓的属灵光景变得更好，反而使他们唯利是图、越来越偏离神（2节）。当亚哈斯作王的时候，神百姓的生活已经和他们的信仰完全脱了节，人的心思已经被地上眼见的好处占满了，不再有公义、圣洁和怜悯，完全偏离了神要他们做「祭司的国度」（出十九6）的旨意。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 以色列人在神面前「是客旅，是寄居的」（利二十五23），只是神所托付的土地的管家，必须遵行与神所立的圣约，才能「在那地上长久」（申四26）。因此，神「将我们的分转归别人」（4节），代表人失去了立约之民的地位和福气。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 奥古斯丁说，世上的人分属两个城，「属地之城用对自己的爱建成，以致轻看神；属天之城用对神的爱建成，以致轻看自己」（《The City of God》14. 28）。弥迦宣告，当神把余民领回家园（四7）、重新拈阄分地时，那些属地之城的成功人士（1-2节），「在耶和华的会中」（5节）将无人代表他们拈阄，失去属天之城的「分」。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 今天，传福音的人也不可高举慈爱和怜悯，忽略神的公义和圣洁，免得成了「别的福音」（加一6）。神的言语只「与行动正直的人有益」（7节），有得救信心的人必然会追求「行动正直」，不但仰望神慈爱、怜悯的恩典，也顺服神公义、圣洁的要求。而「没有行为的信心是死的」（雅二20）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 百姓只听爱听的话，假先知只要投其所好，「就必作这民的先知」（11节）。「这民」（11节）拒绝真理，所以只配得假先知，完全是「自取败坏」（何十三9）。今天，许多人只爱听恩典、慈爱和医治，却不爱听公义、圣洁和十字架，已经有「好些假先知起来，迷惑多人」（太二十四11），正好「作这民的先知」（11节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 弥迦的第一部分信息（一1-二13），以「你们都要听」（一2）开始，以神的应许（12-13节）结束。在神救赎的计划里，百姓的败坏并不是意外，因为神在领百姓进迦南之前就已经宣告：「我将他们领进我向他们列祖起誓应许那流奶与蜜之地，他们在那里吃得饱足，身体肥胖，就必偏向别神，事奉他们，藐视我，背弃我的约」（申三十一20）。而摩西也早已预言：「我知道我死后，你们必全然败坏，偏离我所吩咐你们的道，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，以手所做的惹祂发怒；日后必有祸患临到你们」（申三十一29）。因此，并非旧约是律法、新约是恩典，旧约是靠行为、新约是凭信心，而是旧约和新约都显明了恩典和信心，「律法是我们训蒙的师傅，引我们到基督那里，使我们因信称义」（加三24）。虽然神说：「我未领他们到我所起誓应许之地以先，他们所怀的意念我都知道了」（申三十一21），但神仍然拣选了「全然败坏」的以色列人；因为神的救赎计划，正是要挽回「全然败坏」的亚当后裔，凭公义彻底拆毁他们，在恩典里重新建造他们。\n弥迦书第2章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

当约拿在海中挣扎时，他的第一个念头就是自己已经与神隔绝。虽然过去约拿凭着血气不肯顺服，以为可以「逃往他施去躲避耶和华」（一3），但被「抛在海中」（一15）以后，才发现从神眼前「被驱逐」（4节）是何等可怕的经历。因此，他在海水中急切地仰望神（4节）、呼求神（2节），盼望与神恢复关系。\n当我们和约拿一样不肯顺服神的时候，生命也会像约拿一样一直往下：「下到约帕」（一3）、下到船上（一3）、「下到底舱」（一5）、下到海中（5节）、「下到山根」（6节），离神愈来愈远。神常常任凭我们下到不能再低的「海的深处」（3节），然后才伸手将我们往上托，将我们的性命「从坑中救出来」（6节）。\n4-7节是约拿所经过的救恩。过去，他在头脑里知道神「是有恩典、有怜悯的神，不轻易发怒，有丰盛的慈爱」（四2）；现在，他亲身体验了神的「恩典」、「怜悯」和「丰盛的慈爱」。死亡的经历使他的心变得柔软、顺服，从「躲避耶和华」（一3），变成了「想念耶和华」（7节）。约拿在海中的经历，也是神用来对付我们肉体的方法。\n\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 第8节可译为：「那信奉虚无之偶像的人，将离弃对其偶像的忠诚」。意思是：敬拜偶像的人在难处中就会发现，偶像是虚假无能的，结果就会离弃假神；而敬拜神的人在难处中则会发现，神永远都是值得信靠的。\n[注] 信徒经历苦难，一定经历到上帝值得信靠吗？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「我必用感谢的声音献祭与祢」（9节）引自诗一百一十六17和五十14、23。约拿所感谢的，不是神救他脱离鱼腹，因为他还在鱼腹之中；他所感谢的，是一个「躲避耶和华」（一3）、从神眼前「被驱逐」（4节）的罪人，竟然祷告还蒙神「应允、俯听」（2节）。这也是神对每一个回头浪子的应许（路十五11-24）。\n[敬畏] 「我所许的愿，我必偿还」（9节），引自诗五十14，指约拿愿意顺服神、去尼尼微传道。约拿的祷告并没有奢求神救他脱离鱼腹，也没有用许愿来交换得救；而是神先将他的性命「从坑中救出来」（6节），然后他才「用感谢的声音献祭」（9节），存着感恩的心许愿（9节）。第一章与第二章都以献祭与许愿结束：船上是外邦人的敬畏和许愿（一16），敬畏中带着惧怕；海里是约拿的敬畏和许愿（9节），敬畏中带着顺服。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 约拿个人的救恩经历，使他发出了伟大的信仰宣告：「救恩出于耶和华」（9节）。但是，这个宣告并不表明他已经真正认识「救恩出于耶和华」，所以他很快又因为「救恩出于耶和华」而「大大不悦，且甚发怒」（四1）。因此，神还要继续对付他、造就他。对于不信的人，救恩是把他们从罪恶中救出来；对已信的人，救恩是把我们从肉体里拯救出来。因此，信徒不能只向不信的世人传福音，更要不断地向自己宣讲福音，直到见主面对面。\n约拿书第2章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

当外面的环境太困难的时候，跟随神的人心里就不免产生许多保留。但神却三次点名，命令所罗巴伯、约书亚和百姓都「当刚强」（4节）；神也三次提醒他们，神并不是要人硬着头皮刚强，百姓刚强的依据，乃是「我与你们同在」（一13；二4、5）。神更要百姓清楚地看见，所罗门圣殿的荣耀，并不在于外表的富丽堂皇，而在于神的「荣光充满了殿」（王上八11）。因此，百姓不必寻求新殿外表的华美，而要寻求神的同在，只有神的同在才是真正的荣耀。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 以色列人当年蒙神拯救「出埃及」（5节），并不是因为他们能遵行律法，而是因为神是与以色列祖先立约的神（出三6）。百姓得以进迦南、得产业，也不是因为他们能遵行律法，而是因为神「所应许」（申六3）的白白恩典（申六10-11）。因此，顺服并不能使人赚取恩典，而是人长久活在恩典里的条件。神让百姓落到困苦缺乏之中，是为了让他们摆正生活中的优先次序，重新回到神的恩典里，并且活得更加丰盛。同样，新约的信徒得着救恩，也不是根据我们的好行为，而是根据神白白的恩典；但已经得着救恩的信徒，「既然蒙召，行事为人就当与蒙召的恩相称」（弗四1），生命才能活得更加丰盛。这正是主耶稣所宣告的：「你们要先求祂的国和祂的义，这些东西都要加给你们了」（太六33）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神的工作从来都不需要人倚靠自己的所能、根据自己的所有，祂向我们要什么，就先赐给我们什么；祂要百姓「当刚强」，就赐下「当刚强」的根据。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 在神的眼里，不是生命就是死亡，并没有中间的灰色地带。凡没有连上生命的源头、不是出于神的，都带着死亡的气息，在神眼里都「算污秽」。今天，事奉的人若没有重生的生命，就不会蒙神纪念；工作若不是靠着神儿子的生命做出来的，也不会蒙神悦纳；出于肉体的奉献、事奉和敬拜，反而会越做越让我们被神算为「污秽」，因为「凡不出于信心的都是罪」（罗十四23）。\n今天，我们也常常和从前的百姓一样，心里越是有「污秽」，越是想用更多的奉献、事奉和敬拜来遮掩我们的「污秽」。但在神那里，并没有将功补过、功过相抵的门路，唯一洁净「污秽」的方法，是「认自己的罪，神是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪，洗净我们一切的不义」（约壹一9）。这样，我们的属灵建造才能蒙神悦纳。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 当凭着热心、倚靠势力为神做工的百姓难以为继的时候，神一面「震动天地」、改变环境，一面发表四次信息、改变人心。圣灵把这一段历史摆在圣经里，让我们能透过历史的事实、看到属灵的真相，让我们的眼光能越过人的工作和时代环境，看到神在一切之上的护理，因此在一切的属灵建造上都能顺服神做工的法则：「不是倚靠势力，不是倚靠才能，乃是倚靠我的灵方能成事」（亚四6）。\n哈该书第2章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

虽然他一想到即将临到的灾祸就「战兢」（16节），但他知道神必得胜，所以在「战兢」中静待神的管教到来。先知在「战兢」中的信靠，引出了17-19节的信心凯歌。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 人若「在耶和华里」看见供应人、拯救人的立约之神在一切之上掌权，就可以「狂喜」；无论是「犯境之民上来」（16节）、还是生活困苦缺乏（17节），都能得着力量、满有「喜乐」地拥抱即将到来的管教。因为我们的盼望乃是根据与神不可动摇的立约关系，而不是根据自己灵性的刚强或软弱；是根据神的信实和大能，而不是根据自己的挣扎或努力。所以，我们「深信无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝」（罗八38-39）。立约之神坚定不移的爱，必「使我的脚快如母鹿的蹄，又使我稳行在高处」，在管教和困苦中蒙保守、得恢复。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

神并没有责备约拿的不顺服，而是再次呼召约拿、重申任务。如果只是为了完成工作，神完全可以把不顺服的工人撇在一边，换一个忠心的工人来做。但神的话却「二次临到约拿」（1节），继续给他机会；因为神的心意不仅是要给尼尼微传信息，也是为了改变传信息的约拿。神不但要成就祂的工作，也要改变祂所使用的工人；因为一切救赎工作的最终目的，乃是要得着合神心意的人。因此，每一个事奉神的人，不但要注意工作的本身，更要注意神借着工作在自己身上的心意，免得我们「传福音给别人，自己反被弃绝了」（林前九27）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

「我必使」（9节），原文是「我必转变」。人「从早起来就在一切事上败坏自己」（7节），不可能自己改变自己；只能被神转变，心意被圣灵「更新而变化」（罗十二2）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神清楚地知道，活在肉体里的人无论道理怎样清楚、头脑怎样明白、意志怎样坚定，也没有办法倚靠自己的努力悔改、得救、成圣，反而「从早起来就在一切事上败坏自己」（7节）。因此，神「除灭列国的民」，并不是指望百姓吸取前车之鉴，而是彻底否定亚当的生命，要百姓「等候我，直到我兴起掳掠的日子」（8节）。\n第8节是旧约唯一包含全部22个希伯来字母的经文。\n第8节原文的开始是：「因此，你们要等候我——耶和华说——等候我兴起掳掠的日子」。这个「因此」，表明了神救恩的奥秘：祂允许百姓尝试各种复兴努力、看到各种前车之鉴，最后仍然失败，「因此」不得不承认自己「已经死在过犯罪恶之中」（弗二1），「凡有血气的，没有一人因行律法称义」（加二26），只能「等候」（8节）神。这样，律法才能成为「我们训蒙的师傅，引我们到基督那里，使我们因信称义」（加三24）。\n西番雅书第3章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

金牛犊的「祭司」（7节）不是把人带到神面前，而是阻挡人回到耶路撒冷的圣殿，把人带到似是而非、以假乱真的金牛犊面前，所以神说：「祭司越发增多，就越发得罪我」（7节）。今天，普世教会里也出现了许许多多的假祭司，高举「大爱恩典、自由民主、美好人生、和睦家庭」，实际上是把人带离真神，以肉体的需要为金牛犊；这样的「祭司越发增多」，就越发得罪神。\n今天，信徒的属灵光景越软弱，教导自我肯定、自我释放、挽救婚姻、教养儿女的市场也越兴旺。其中有许多人否定人的全然败坏、回避彻底的认罪悔改，引用几句圣经，教导自我改善的方法，实际上都是「以敬虔为得利的门路」（提前六5）的假祭司。\n我们常常以为是自己在等候神，其实是神在等候我们回转。

耶路撒冷即将面临苦难，在人看，这是神国度的失败。但实际上，在人的失败背后，神自有奥秘的「筹划」（12节）。在神这位「谋士」的「筹划」中，锡安被掳的痛苦并不是永无止境的苦难，而是通往拯救和荣耀的希望之门。因此，神命令以色列「要疼痛劬劳」，就像生孩子一样「从城里出来」（10节），被掳到巴比伦，然后在那里「蒙解救」（10节），被「救赎」（10节）成为新生的以色列。 这「筹划」分成三个部分：9-10节是第一部分，11-13节是第二部分，五1-6是第三部分。\n弥迦书第4章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":269,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/032_Jonah/Jonah_04/","title":"04

耶和华说、你这样发怒合乎理么。\n4:5 于是约拿出城、坐在城的东边、在那里为自己搭了一座棚、坐在棚的荫下、要看看那城究竟如何。4\n4:6 耶和华　神安排一棵蓖麻、使其发生高过约拿、影儿遮盖他的头、救他脱离苦楚。约拿因这棵蓖麻大大喜乐。5\n4:7 次日黎明、　神却安排一条虫子、咬这蓖麻、以致枯槁。\n4:8 日头出来的时候、　神安排炎热的东风。日头曝晒约拿的头、使他发昏、他就为自己求死、说、我死了比活着还好。6\n4:9 神对约拿说、你因这棵蓖麻发怒合乎理么。 他说、我发怒以至于死、都合乎理。7\n4:10 耶和华说、这蓖麻不是你栽种的、也不是你培养的。 一夜发生、一夜干死你尚且爱惜。\n4:11 何况这尼尼微大城、其中不能分辨左手右手的有十二万多人、并有许多牲畜、我岂能不爱惜呢。8\n  约拿的心目中，符合他心意的才叫作「恩典、慈爱」，临到仇敌尼尼微人身上的，却是「妥协纵容」、「出尔反尔」、「随心所欲」、「轻信罪人」，或者是「交换恩典」。总之，神的作为不符合约拿的神学、或者不符合他的感情，所以约拿就「大大不悦，且甚发怒」（1节）。他就像主耶稣比喻中的那个恶仆，自己被豁免了巨额债务，却抓着欠他小钱的人不放（太十八23-30），所以主说：「你不应当怜恤你的同伴，像我怜恤你吗」（太十八33）？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 约拿第二次的祷告（2节）与第一次的祷告（二2-9）判若两人：第一次自知理亏，所以谦卑感恩；第二次却自恃有理，所以理直气壮。船上的水手和尼尼微的居民都因为迫切的求生欲望，不得不向神降服；但约拿竟然两次求死（3、8节），还以为自己是伟大的殉道者。人的自以为义，使神的先知也完全落到血气的辖制里；连先知的公义、爱心和敬虔都是如此的不可靠、不稳定，我们又有什么理由认为自己能更加顺服呢？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 约拿第二次的祷告特别提到：「我在本国的时候岂不是这样说吗」（2节）。这句话表明，虽然他已经认罪悔改、也顺服地来到尼尼微，但心里却没有彻底柔软下来。因此，当尼尼微的结局不符合约拿的期望时，他暂时被压抑的血气就爆发了。这正是我们肉体的光景：当风暴来临时，里面确实会产生一时的悔改和顺服；但风暴过去以后，肉体里出来的信心也就随着风暴一起消失。因此，接受神用风暴来对付自己的肉体，是我们一生的功课。\n约拿爱国、爱神、不怕牺牲，却不肯放下自己，结果只注重完成工作，却忽略了神在工作里的心意；因此，工作虽然是神的工作，所表达的却不是神的心意。今天，许多信徒也是只重视大使命，却忽略了主在大使命中的心意，结果越传福音、越喂养肉体；许多传道人也是只关注教会的增长，却忽略了「凡事长进，连于元首基督」（弗四15），结果把神的国度变成了人的国度，把圣殿建成了巴别塔。\n神在乎我们实行大使命，让救恩临到外邦人；也在乎我们的生命在大使命中被改变，得着更加丰盛、全备的救恩。因此，神的工作并没有停止在尼尼微人的悔改，还要继续在约拿身上动工，好让我们看到，祂将怎样把我们改变成合神心意的人。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 约拿完全忘了：神既然可以赦免他的不顺服，为什么不能同样赦免尼尼微呢？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「苦楚」（6节）原文「邪恶、灾祸」，与约拿大大「不悦」（1节）是同一个字。「救他脱离苦楚」（6节）是双关语，表明神这样安排的目的，不但是要把约拿从酷热的灾祸中救出来，也是要把他从不顺服的罪恶中救出来。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 为了使约拿的心能柔软下来，神「安排一条大鱼」（一17）、「安排一棵蓖麻树」（6节），用慈爱让约拿得以存活；又「安排一条虫子」（7节）、「安排炎热的东风」（8节），凭公义取走约拿所不配得的安息。神「安排」这四样实物教材，表明神不但创造生命，也有权终止生命；神不但有主权施行怜悯，也有主权施行公义。如果神只是凭公义治理世界，在降罚尼尼微之前，首先应该惩罚不肯顺服神的约拿。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 不认识神的世人自以为义到一个地步，总是以自我为中心，要求神按照自己的标准来施行公义或慈爱，好让自己感觉舒服，否则就指责神不够公义、不够慈爱。许多信徒也存在同样的属灵危机：不是自己顺服神，而是要求神顺服自己；不是承认自己不能完全明白神的奥秘，而是要求神必须符合自己的神学立场。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神用一个问题结束了约拿书，成了一个开放的结尾。因此，当我们责怪神任凭恶人横行、怀疑神不关心自己、或者觉得神不再掌控世界的时候，神也在用这个问题反问我们：「我岂能不爱惜呢」（11节）？答案当然是「爱惜」，但必须按照神的时间、根据祂的方式。约拿所要的公义审判，神当然会有，但不是在此时，而是等亚述完成了神所命定的管教任务以后（赛十5-6），神「必罚亚述王自大的心和他高傲眼目的荣耀」（赛十12）；约拿所要的爱惜怜悯，神当然也会有，但不是在此时，而是等百姓被神彻底拆毁之后，神「必建立大卫倒塌的帐幕，堵住其中的破口，把那破坏的建立起来，重新修造」（摩九11）。\n因此，虽然约拿书显明神的怜悯将同样临到外邦人，但重点却不是向外邦人宣教。因为神领尼尼微悔改，并不是为了向亚述宣教，而是暂时限制亚述的扩张（王下十四25）；最终公义的审判还是要临到亚述，尼尼微必然会「空虚荒凉」（鸿二10）。约拿书所要启示的，是神要造就合祂心意的人：不但外面有顺服的行为，而且里面有体贴神的心；不但关心做成神的工作，而且完全放下自己，顺服神的计划和方法，体贴神在工作中的心意。这样的事奉，才是合神心意的事奉；这样行出的公义和慈爱，才是神性情的彰显。\n约拿显然明白了神的心意，所以无声地顺服了。如此自以为义的约拿，居然被神改变了，所以说约拿「为尼尼微人成了神迹」（路十一30）。今天最大的神迹，一方面是道居然愿意成为肉身，并且为罪人而死，借着祂的死而复活拯救世人；另一方面是神居然愿意住在信徒里面，让人的「心意更新而变化」（罗十二2），「从他们肉体中除掉石心，赐给他们肉心」（结十一19），让我们不但成为做神工作的仆人，而且成为体贴神心意的儿子。\n约拿书第4章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

弥六章","section":"Micah","content":"弥迦书\n本章是神在天地之间设立法庭，神是控方，百姓是被告，「山岭、冈陵」（1节）是陪审团。 七百多年前，摩西在百姓进迦南之前「呼天唤地」（申四26）作见证，宣告百姓若违背圣约，「必在过约旦河得为业的地上速速灭尽」（申四26）。现在，神召唤「山岭和地永久的根基」（2节）再次来作见证，证明百姓违背圣约的事实。\n6:1 以色列人哪、当听耶和华的话。要起来向山岭争辩、使冈陵听你的话。\n6:2 山岭和地永久的根基阿、要听耶和华争辩的话。因为耶和华要与他的百姓争辩、与以色列争论。\n6:3 我的百姓阿、我向你作了甚么呢。我在甚么事上使你厌烦。你可以对我证明。\n6:4 我曾将你从埃及地领出来、从作奴仆之家救赎你。我也差遣摩西、亚伦、和米利暗在你前面行。1\n6:5 我的百姓阿、你们当追念摩押王巴勒所设的谋和比珥的儿子巴兰回答他的话、并你们从什亭到吉甲所遇见的事、好使你们知道耶和华公义的作为。2\n6:6 我朝见耶和华、在至高　神面前跪拜、当献上甚么呢。岂可献一岁的牛犊为燔祭么。\n6:7 耶和华岂喜悦千千的公羊、或是万万的油河么。我岂可为自己的罪过献我的长子么。为心中的罪恶献我身所生的么。3\n6:8 世人哪、耶和华已指示你何为善。他向你所要的是甚么呢。只要你行公义、好怜悯、存谦卑的心、与你的　神同行。4\n6:9 耶和华向这城呼叫、智慧人必敬畏他的名。你们当听是谁派定刑杖的惩罚。\n6:10 恶人家中不仍有非义之财、和可恶的小升斗么。\n6:11 我若用不公道的天平和囊中诡诈的法码、岂可算为清洁呢。\n6:12 城里的富户满行强暴、其中的居民也说谎言、口中的舌头是诡诈的。\n6:13 因此、我击打你、使你的伤痕甚重。 使你因你的罪恶荒凉。\n6:14 你要吃、却吃不饱。你的虚弱必显在你中间。你必挪去、却不得救护。所救护的、我必交给刀剑。\n6:15 你必撒种、却不得收割。 踹橄榄、却不得油抹身。 踹葡萄、却不得酒喝。\n6:16 因为你守暗利的恶规、行亚哈家一切所行的、顺从他们的计谋。因此、我必使你荒凉、使你的居民令人嗤笑。 你们也必担当我民的羞辱。5\n  第4节的「领出来 עָלָה」原文与第3节的「厌烦 לָאָה」谐音。神用谐音对比出埃及（4节）和进迦南（5节）两次逾越节的历史，是引导百姓反省自己对神恩典的不感恩、不认识（3节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 明明是「耶和华要与祂的百姓争辩」（2节），但神却两次动情地呼唤「我的百姓啊」（3、5节）。因为神的指控是为了挽回百姓，而不是败坏百姓。\n神提到祂差遣「摩西、亚伦，和米利暗」（4节）作出埃及的领袖，是谴责现在失职领袖的败坏（三1-12）。 「什亭」（5节）是以色列人过约旦河之前的最后一个营地（书三1），「吉甲」（5节）是以色列人过约旦河之后的第一个营地（书四19）。神让百姓所追念的「从什亭到吉甲所遇见的事」（5节），包括：\n在百姓还不知道的时候，神将巴兰的咒诅化为祝福（民二十二1-二十四25），这是神的慈爱和保守。\n百姓与摩押女子行淫被罚（民二十五1-18），又蒙神赦免，这是神的公义和怜悯。\n神分开约旦河、带领百姓进入迦南（书三1-17），这是神的信实和大能。\n神让百姓追念这些历史，是让百姓借着「耶和华公义的作为」（5节）来认识神的性情，并思想作为圣约的百姓所应当有的回应。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「我岂可为自己的罪过献我的长子吗」（7节），原文是「我应该为自己的罪过献我的长子吗」（英文ESV、NASB译本）。当时的犹大王亚哈斯曾经效法外邦恶习，用火「焚烧他的儿女」（代下二十八3）。在出埃及时，神宣告「以色列中凡头生的，无论是人是牲畜，都是我的，要分别为圣归我」（出十三2），但百姓必须献祭牲赎回长子（出十三13），而不是焚烧儿女献祭。\n神用白白的恩典领百姓出埃及、进迦南（4节），又用「公义的作为」（5节）显明了祂的性情，但百姓不但没有用爱和顺服来回应神奇妙的救恩，反而把西奈圣约当作商业契约，以为神救赎自己所图的是祭物。6-7节是假设一个人不断地提高出价，以寻求能满足神要求的价格：是普通的燔祭，还是比较昂贵的一岁牛犊呢？是千千的公羊，还是万万的油河呢？最多是献上长子为祭，出价可不能再高了。\n这个人好像很属灵，不断地寻求如何讨神喜悦，但是实际上，他的每个问题都是在侮辱神，用人的败坏来忖度神，把神当作可以收买的偶像。他的问题实际上是在讨价还价，希望成本越低越好。今天，我们奉献、事奉的心思是否也像这个人一样，只不过是想用奉献和事奉来贿赂神呢？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 出于肉体的「公义」和「怜悯」，很快就会变质、消失，最终变成「无诚实，无良善，无人认识神」（何四1）。因此，从肉体里出来的任何东西，都是神看不上的；神向人要什么，就会先赐给人什么：祂向人要「行公义，好怜悯」（8节）的行为，就会先赐给人「行公义，好怜悯」的能力，而不是要人靠自己「行公义，好怜悯」；祂要人成为神的儿子，就先会赐给人神儿子的生命，而不是要人努力进步改善、变成神的儿子。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 今天，神也不允许祂所拣选的人长久地停留在神以外的事物上，因此，神管教信徒的原则也是如此：我们在神之外看重什么，神就会取走什么。即使是追求貌似「属灵」的事物或事奉，只要是高过了神的地位，结果也会不得满足、枉费工夫。\n弥迦书第6章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

神指出：圣殿被毁之后的七十年里，百姓自己创立的禁食只是以自我为中心的自怜自虐（赛五十八3），并不是真实、谦卑地向神悔罪（5-6节）。而现在想取消这些禁食，也是「为自己吃，为自己喝」（6节）、满足自己的需要，并不是因为圣殿即将重建完成。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 被掳之前的列祖既然不肯听从神，神也不会听他们以自我为中心祷告（13节）。百姓若不能从列祖的失败历史里学到教训，在神的话语面前继续「不肯听从，扭转肩头，塞耳不听，使心硬如金钢石」（11-12节），即使每天都「禁食悲哀」（5节），在神面前也毫无用处。因为神必「不听」（13节）！\n因此，纪念圣殿被毁的禁食若不能使百姓思想圣殿为什么被毁，禁食只是假冒为善；新殿若不能使百姓牢记旧殿被毁的原因，重建也毫无意义。同样，圣餐和洗礼若不能使我们思想与神的真实关系，也只是虚有其表的宗教仪式；奉献和事奉若不能使我们「凡事长进，连于元首基督」（弗四15），变得越来越「柔和谦卑」（太十一29），也都是徒然劳碌，只会使自己的灵命和教会的光景「荒凉了」。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

「我的神必应允我」（7节）原文是「我的神必垂听」，意思是「我的神必在乎」。此时，周围环境中的一切看起来已经黑暗到极点，南国内忧外患，神的百姓还有希望吗？「祭司的国度」（出十九6）还有出路吗？这时，先知不是沮丧、放弃，而是在祷告中「仰望、等候」（7节）。「等候」是无助者最有力的行动（诗三十八15；四十二5、11；四十三5；一百三十5），因为神必在乎。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 正统犹太人在每年犹太新年（吹角节 Rosh Hashanah）的下午，都会举行赎罪仪式（Tashlich），在水边诵读18-20节，并且倒空口袋、或把代表罪的面包片丢入水中，象征「将我们的一切罪投于深海」（19节）。\n「雅各」、「亚伯拉罕」（20节）都是以色列人的先祖，代表神的选民。雅各是一个诡诈的人（创二十七36），神却「向雅各发诚实」（20节），表明圣约里的恩典、怜悯、诚实和慈爱（18-20节）并不是因为人的光景，而是因为神自己的性情（出三十四6）。因此，这恩典也能临到我们这些同样诡诈、不配的人，「基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了」（罗五8）。\n「慈爱」（20节）原文是「不变的爱」（英文ESV、NASB译本），并不是指无缘无故的爱，而是指「守约的慈爱」（撒下七15）。神「守约的慈爱」，是不配的百姓在失败和黑暗中仍能存留盼望的唯一根据。\n「将罪孽踏在脚下」（19节），指神将胜过罪恶。古代中东的君王在战胜仇敌时，把脚踏在敌人头上，表示胜利（书十24；诗六十12）。\n「投于深海」（19节），指神将彻底赦免、清除百姓的罪。在出埃及的路上，「法老的车辆、军兵，耶和华已抛在海中」（出十五4）；同样，在百姓回归的路上，神也会「将我们的一切罪投于深海」（19节）。\n「有何神像祢」（18节），就是「弥迦」这个名字的意思，是双关语。再没有别神能像真神一样「赦免罪孽」（18节），又有恩典、怜悯、诚实和慈爱（18-20节）。如果神不肯赦罪、永远怀怒，先知所发表的谴责和审判只是发泄忿怒；而人因为已经「死在过犯罪恶之中」（弗二1），灵性无能为力，只会越谴责越绝望、越审判越刚硬。但神却是「不永远怀怒，喜爱施恩」（18节）的神，祂用「赦免之恩」（诗一百三十3-4）来叫人敬畏祂，祂用守约的「诚实」和「慈爱」（20节）给人存留了得救的盼望，所以先知不能不在此称颂神的救恩！\n摩西的凯旋之歌是回顾神过去的得胜，但弥迦的凯旋之歌却是展望更大的救恩；这救恩不但给以色列人，也给我们这些从前质问「耶和华——你神在哪里」（10节）的外邦人带来了得救的盼望。\n弥迦书第7章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

神亲自拆毁，也必亲手重建。当百姓经历了神早已「定意」（14节）的管教以后（申二十八64），神也必「照样」（13节）施行祂早已「定意」（15节）的拯救（申三十1-3）。虽然百姓的罪「使美好之地荒凉了」（七14），但在神的护理之下，「荒凉」的结果并不是败坏，而是预备复兴：「你们的地荒凉，要享受众安息」（利二十六34）。而在神的「定意」里，「照着拣选的恩典，还有所留的余数」（罗十一5），现在正是神要「使这余剩的民享受这一切的福」（12节）的时候。圣殿要重建、教会要复兴，环境和肉体里有太多的理由可以叫我们胆寒。但真正的重建和复兴并不是倚靠人的努力、也不是根据人的属灵光景，而是出于神必成就的「定意」。因此，过去的百姓可以「不要惧怕，手要强壮」（13节），放胆继续重建工程；今天的信徒也可以「不要怕，只管讲」（徒十八9），因为主耶稣应许遵行大使命的门徒：「我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了」（太二十八20）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神在「你们所当行的」（16节）清单里，完全不提禁食，而是重申了从前向百姓列祖的要求（七9-10）。这表明神的要求从来都没有变过，应当改变的是百姓；百姓应当以失败的列祖为鉴（七11-14），不要光有「禁食」（19节）的形式，而要真实地认罪悔改，活出讨神喜悦的生活。\n撒迦利亚书第8章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

Wars，主前499-449年），希腊文明开始崛起。\n主前547年，古列王征服了小亚细亚的爱奥尼亚（Ionia），但爱奥尼亚的希腊城邦一直在寻求独立。主前515年，圣殿重建完成。十六年后，爱奥尼亚的希腊城邦开始反抗波斯。主前492年，大流士一世入侵希腊，但在主前490年的马拉松战役中被雅典打败，最后于主前486年去世。希波战争持续到主前449年的卡里阿斯和约（Peace of Callias），最终希腊城邦获胜。从此，波斯帝国逐渐走向衰落，历史和文明的重心逐渐从美索不达米亚转移到地中海地区；而雅典则进入黄金时期，希腊文明发扬光大，成为现代西方文明的基础。在这个时候，神宣告了地上的历史将要怎样成就祂的救赎计划，祂将怎样带领人类进入弥赛亚千年国度。\n九1-十一3原文都是诗歌，应当作为一篇完整的信息联系在一起，才能准确地领会神的心意。\n9:1

私生子〔或作外族人〕必住在亚实突。我必除灭非利士人的骄傲。 9:7 我必除去他口中带血之肉、和牙齿内可憎之物。他必作为余剩的人、归与我们的　神。必在犹大像族长、以革伦人必如耶布斯人。 9:8 我必在我家的四围安营、使敌军不得任意往来。暴虐的人也不再经过。因为我亲眼看顾我的家。 9:9 锡安的民哪、应当大大喜乐。耶路撒冷的民哪、应当欢呼。看哪、你的王来到你这里。他是公义的、并且施行拯救、谦谦和和的骑着驴、就是骑着驴的驹子。 (2) 9:10 我必除灭以法莲的战车、和耶路撒冷的战马。争战的弓也必除灭。他必向列国讲和平。他的权柄必从这海管到那海、从大河管到地极。\n9:11 锡安哪、我因与你立约的血、将你中间被掳而囚的人、从无水的坑中释放出来。 9:12 你们被囚而有指望的人、都要转回保障。我今日说明、我必加倍赐福给你们。 9:13 我拿犹大作上弦的弓、我拿以法莲为张弓的箭。锡安哪、我要激发你的众子、攻击希腊〔原文作雅完〕的众子、使你如勇士的刀。 9:14 耶和华必显现在他们以上。他的箭必射出像闪电。主耶和华必吹角、乘南方的旋风而行。 9:15 万军之耶和华必保护他们。他们必吞灭仇敌、践踏弹石。他们必喝血呐喊、犹如饮酒。他们必像盛满血的碗、又像坛的四角、满了血。 (3)\n9:16 当那日耶和华他们的　神必看他的民、如群羊拯救他们。因为他们必像冠冕上的宝石、高举在他的地以上〔高举云云或作在他的地上发光辉〕\n9:17 他的恩慈何等大、他的荣美何其盛。五谷健壮少男、新酒培养处女。 (4)\n 撒迦利亚书第9章逐节注解、祷读\n  「推罗

「你的王」（9节），就是新约百姓所盼望的弥赛亚（太二十一9）。当时的波斯王是骑马的（斯六8），亚历山大也骑着威风凌凌的战马，但这位千年国度的君王却「是公义的，并且施行拯救，谦谦和和地骑着驴」（9节）。主耶稣基督在上十字架之前，骑着和平的驴驹进入了耶路撒冷（约十二15；太二十一2-5），应验了第9节的预言。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 律法并不允许「喝血」（15节），第15节原文并没有提到「血」。「他们必喝血呐喊，犹如饮酒」（15节），原文是「他们必又喝又呐喊，犹如饮酒」（英文ESV、NASB译本）。「他们必像盛满血的碗，又像坛的四角满了血」（15节），原文是「他们必充满如碗，浸透如坛的四角」（英文ESV、NASB译本）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 壮观激烈的战争场面（13-15节），突然变成了宁静安详的田园风光（16-17节），这正是哈米吉多顿大战以后、进入千年国度的光景，神的百姓将在弥赛亚的国度里得安息、得荣耀、得供应。今天，许多信徒的争战，是越争战，血气越旺；越争战，生命越不能「与基督一同藏在神里面」（西三3），失去了柔和谦卑的见证。但神所带领的一切属灵争战，目的都是为了进入基督里的安息，而不是停留在政治、社会等任何今世的诉求。凡不能使我们安息在基督里的争战，都不是神所带领的争战。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

与那君结盟之后、他必行诡诈、因为他必上来以微小的军〔原文作民〕成为强盛。\n11:24 趁人坦然无备的时候、他必来到国中极肥美之地、行他列祖和他列祖之祖所未曾行的、将掳物、掠物、和财宝、散给众人。又要设计攻打保障、然而这都是暂时的。\n11:25 他必奋勇向前、率领大军攻击南方王、南方王也必以极大极强的军兵与他争战、却站立不住、因为有人设计谋害南方王。\n11:26 吃王膳的、必败坏他、他的军队、必被冲没、而且被杀的甚多。\n11:27 至于这二王、他们心怀恶计、同席说谎、计谋却不成就、因为到了定期、事就了结。\n11:28 北方王〔原文作他〕必带许多财宝回往本国、他的心反对圣约、任意而行、回到本地。\n11:29 到了定期、他必返回、来到南方、后一次、却不如前一次、 11:30 因为基提战船、必来攻击他、他就丧胆而回、又要恼恨圣约、任意而行。他必回来联络背弃圣约的人。\n11:31 他必兴兵、这兵必亵渎圣地、就是保障、除掉常献的燔祭、设立那行毁坏可憎的。\n11:32 作恶违背圣约的人、他必用巧言勾引。惟独认识　神的子民、必刚强行事。\n11:33 民间的智慧人、必训诲多人、然而他们多日必倒在刀下、或被火烧、或被掳掠抢夺。\n11:34 他们仆倒的时候、稍得扶助、却有许多人用谄媚的话亲近他们。\n11:35 智慧人中有些仆倒的、为要熬炼其余的人、使他们清净洁白、直到末了、因为到了定期、事就了结。\n11:36 王必任意而行、自高自大、超过所有的　神、又用奇异的话攻击万　神之　神。他必行事亨通、直到主的忿怒完毕、因为所定的事、必然成就。1\n11:37 他必不顾他列祖的神、也不顾妇女所羡慕的神、无论何神他都不顾、因为他必自大、高过一切。\n11:38 他倒要敬拜保障的神、用金银宝石、和可爱之物、敬奉他列祖所不认识的神。\n11:39 他必靠外邦神的帮助、攻破最坚固的保障。凡承认他的、他必将荣耀加给他们、使他们管辖许多人、又为贿赂分地与他们。\n11:40 到末了、南方王要与他交战、北方王必用战车、马兵、和许多战船、势如暴风来攻击他、也必进入列国如洪水泛滥。\n11:41 又必进入那荣美之地、有许多国就被倾覆、但以东人、摩押人、和一大半亚扪人、必脱离他的手。\n11:42 他必伸手攻击列国。埃及地也不得脱离。\n11:43 他必把持埃及的金银财宝、和各样的宝物。吕彼亚人、和古实人、都必跟从他。\n11:44 但从东方和北方必有消息扰乱他、他就大发烈怒出去、要将多人杀灭净尽。\n11:45 他必在海和荣美的圣山中间、设立他如宫殿的帐幕。然而到了他的结局、必无人能帮助他。\n  人类罪性的根源，是想「如神能知道善恶」（创三5）；权力越大、暴露得越严重（3、16节；八4）。因此，「王必任意而行，自高自大，超过所有的神，又用奇异的话攻击万神之神」（36节）。一个自我膨胀的人，最终只能成为无神论。但这一切都在神的计划之中，所以「他必行事亨通，直到主的忿怒完毕，因为所定的事必然成就」（36节），因为无论人如何自负，人还是人、神始终是神。\n但以理书第11章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

十二-十四章是关于「耶和华的日子」（十四1）的伟大预言，其中十九次提到「那日」和「耶和华的日子」，清楚地启示了基督在「耶和华的日子」再来审判、在地上建立千年国度的过程，是旧约中对「耶和华的日子」描述最详细的经文。这段预言以「铺张诸天、建立地基、造人里面之灵的耶和华」（1节；赛四十二5）开始，宣告我们的神全能、全知、全在，既能创造天地，也能改变人心。这段预言又用了六十三个「必」字（和合本译文），准确地表明神的应许永不改变、必要成就。人类的历史不会循环重演，也不会持续向下，更不会持续向上，而是不断走向神所预定的目标。这历史并不掌握在人类自己的手中，神的计划并不倚靠信徒的配合或努力，是祂自己使「万事都互相效力」（罗八28），使历史走向救赎计划里的终点。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「那日」（3节），经历了两千年大流散的以色列人已经归回，但耶路撒冷城却被列国围困。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 这也是一切属灵争战的原则：正如保罗「所遭遇的事更是叫福音兴旺」（腓一12），并且使人能因他所受的捆锁反而「笃信不疑，越发放胆传神的道，无所惧怕」（腓一14）；信徒并不是只有成功、顺利的时候才能荣耀神，我们在失败和难处中的经历，照样能见证神在我们身上的工作。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 当耶路撒冷被仇敌围困的时候，神先拯救耶路撒冷之外的乡村，最后才拯救耶路撒冷，免得百姓把得胜归功于人的荣耀。但神却始终「保护耶路撒冷的居民」（8节），并使「他们中间软弱的」（8节）也能象大卫那样能征善战，而他们的首领则要像「耶和华的使者」（8节）那样大有能力。这也是一切属灵争战的原则：「你们所遇见的试探，无非是人所能受的。神是信实的，必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的；在受试探的时候，总要给你们开一条出路，叫你们能忍受得住」（林前十13）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「施恩叫人恳求的灵」（10节），原文是「恩典与恳求的灵」（英文ESV、NASB译本），指圣灵。\n「他们所扎的」（10节），除了主耶稣在十字架上的遭遇（约十九34），在历史上并没有应验在别人身上。\n「我必将那施恩叫人恳求的灵，浇灌大卫家和耶路撒冷的居民」（10节），这句话清楚地宣告：将来「以色列全家都要得救」（罗十一26），并不是因为人首先认罪、悔改，而是因为神主动的恩典和圣灵的工作。人被罪玷污的自由意志没有可能自己决定信主，只有圣灵才能叫人在难处中「恳求」救恩；只有神主动「将那施恩叫人恳求的灵」先赐给我们，我们才可能真实地「口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫祂从死里复活」（罗十9）。因此，「你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸」（弗二8-9）。

(Zechariah 13:9)\nGrace transmutes us into precious metal, and then the fire and the furnace follows as a necessary consequence. Do we start at this? Would we sooner be accounted worthless, that we might enjoy repose, like the stones of the field! This would be to choose the viler part—like Esau, to take the pottage and give up the covenant portion. No, Lord; we will gladly be cast into the furnace rather than be cast out from Thy presence!\nThe fire only refines; it does not destroy. We are to be brought through the fire, not left in it. The Lord values His people as silver, and therefore He is at pains to purge away their dross. If we are wise, we shall rather welcome the refining process than decline it. Our prayer will be that our alloy may be taken from us rather than that we should be withdrawn from the crucible.\nO Lord, Thou triest us indeed! We are ready to melt under the fierceness of the flame. Still, this is Thy way, and Thy way is the best. Sustain us under the trial and complete the process of our purifying, and we will be Thine forever and ever.\nSpurgeon: Faith\u0026rsquo;s Cheque Book\n神首先启示了救恩的应许：祂所拣选的「三分之一仍必存留」（8节）；接着启示了人得应许的途径：「他们必求告我的名，我必应允他们」（9节）。这两个条件缺一不可： 若没有神主动的预备和拣选，任何人的道德、行为或哲学、方法，都只能使人自我陶醉，并不能使人真正得救； 任何模棱两可、「心持两意」（王上十八21），不必弃绝自己、专心「求告」神的门道，都只能使人自欺欺人，并不能得着神所应许的救恩。 以色列人和外邦人顽梗悖逆的本相是一样的，得救的途径也是一样的：因着神的拣选、「凡求告主名的就必得救」（罗十13；徒二21）。顽梗的犹太教经历了两千年的苦难，仍然拒绝接受主耶稣为基督，结果「凡不认子的，就没有父」（约壹二23）。因此，信实守约的神「必将那施恩叫人恳求的灵，浇灌大卫家和耶路撒冷的居民」（十二10），并且「使这三分之一经火」（9节），使蒙拣选的以色列余民能真正「求告耶和华名」（珥二32），被恢复成「祭司的国度」（出十九6）。\n撒迦利亚书第13章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

gospel to every creature.\n16 He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.\n17 And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;\n18 they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”\nBeliever\u0026rsquo;s Bible says:\nWe believe that these signs were intended primarily for the apostolic age, before the complete Bible was available in written form. Most of these signs are found in the Book of Acts.\nWhat was the purpose of these miracles? We believe the answer is found in Heb 2:3-4 2. Before the NT was available in completed form, men would ask the apostles and others for proof that the gospel was divine. To confirm the preaching, God bore witness with signs and wonders and various gifts of the Holy Spirit.\nThe need for these signs is gone today. We have the complete Bible. If men won\u0026rsquo;t believe that, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t believe anyway. Mark did not say that the miracles would continue. The words “to the end of the age” are not found here as they are in Mat_28:18-20.\nHowever, Martin Luther suggested that “the signs here spoken of are to be used according to need. When the need arises, and the Gospel is hard pressed, then we must definitely do these signs, before we allow the Gospel to be maligned and knocked down.”\n弟兄D与弟兄L的交流：\n弟兄D: 在这个世界里有撒旦，有毒物，有害人的东西，在信的人有神的保守。手按病人这里讲到了不止一个人，所以不是一个人追求。感谢主。他是牧者，我们是他的羊。\n父亲爱孩子，在不同的阶段用不同的方式表达，小的时候可以给糖吃，但是不会一直给糖。圣经里面的神迹是为了让我们看其所代表的，而不只是看其表面。\n盼望人不停留在追求神迹的阶段。\n弟兄L: 哦，你的看法是“行神迹”是有时效性的。在信徒早期的经历里会发生。\n弟兄D: 现在也仍然会有, 是神的供应和保守, 但有些神迹只是在特别的情况下，看怎么定义神迹？\n弟兄L: 我想：要是神迹能引那人走向耶稣，那是耶稣想看到的。否则，要是单单满足那人的需要，可能求也求不到，或者没有下一次了。\n我认同这个观点：最大的神迹是人生命的改变。人人都当追求这个。\n弟兄D: 阿们 弟兄L: 我是否可以说：神迹是神的恩典中的一种。虽然神迹是神通过信徒这个管道行出来的，但追求“行神迹的能力”是不可取的。 弟兄D: 感谢主，这是属灵的看见。\n不管是miracle还是sign，这是神的一个表号，为了要彰显他自己。满有恩慈是神的神性。圣灵凭己意行万事。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n ‪Hebrews‬2:2-4 NKJV 2 For if

我必从你们中间除净叛逆和得罪我的人、将他们从所寄居的地方领出来、他们却不得入以色列地。你们就知道我是耶和华。\n20:39 以色列家阿、至于你们、主耶和华如此说、从此以后若不听从我、就任凭你们去事奉偶像、只是不可再因你们的供物和偶像亵渎我的圣名。\n20:40

神从来都不会拒绝专心寻求祂的人，祂亲口应许：「你们寻求我，若专心寻求我，就必寻见」（耶二十九13）。但神也会先问我们：「你们来是求问我吗」（3节）？如果求问神的人并不愿意顺服神的旨意，只想听到合己心意的答案，再明白神的旨意也没有用。所以神两次宣告：「我指着我的永生起誓，我必不被你们求问」（3、31节；十四3、7-8）。\n「人子啊，你要审问审问他们吗」（4节），可译为「人子啊，你要审问他们吗？你要审问吗」（和合本修订版，英文ESV译本）。人只想求问前程，神却要他们反思过去；人只想快速知道答案，神却要他们先上一堂历史课——「你当使他们知道他们列祖那些可憎的事」（4节）。人若不肯从历史里学习功课，就没有任何前途可言；人若愿意认真反省历史，历史必会告诉他们未来。因为自从以色列被拣选以来，人的罪性从未改善，神的工作法则也永不改变。\n今天，有些人平时不肯查考圣经，遇到事情才来求问神，神也不会被他们求问。因为「日光之下并无新事」（传一９），许多回答早已记录在圣经的历史里，「他们遭遇这些事都要作为鉴戒，并且写在经上，正是警戒我们这末世的人」（林前十11）。\n既然以色列还在重复过去，自然也可以从历史里找到未来；既然以色列已经三次经历了神的管教模式（5-26节），当然也应该知道神将怎样对待悖逆的百姓（27-31节）。因此，神第二次强调：「我岂能让你们求问呢」（31节）？因为答案已经写在历史里了。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 过去，神怎样「用大能的手和伸出来的膀臂」（申五15）把百姓领出埃及，现在，祂也要「用大能的手和伸出来的膀臂，并倾出来的忿怒」（33节）来治理他们，把他们从万民中领出来（34节），带领他们再一次经历旷野（35-36节；何二14；十二9）。这个旷野将是一个刑罚的旷野（35-36节）、洁净的旷野（37节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

在巴比伦帝国时期，推罗也是埃及的盟友，曾鼓动犹大反叛巴比伦（耶二十七3），耶路撒冷陷落之后，自信的推罗不但没有为之悲哀、反而满眼都是商机，期望从中获利（2节）。因此，神必与她为敌；推罗越是把经济成就当作荣耀，神就越要彻底夺去她贸易霸主的地位。\n埃及和推罗代表古代文明在经济和文化上的最高成就：埃及是农业文明的中心，推罗是商业文明的中心；埃及是大陆文明最发达的地方，推罗是海上文明最发达的地方；埃及以政治影响世界，推罗以贸易影响世界；埃及采取专制独裁，推罗采取独立自治；埃及以军事威势为荣耀，推罗以财富智慧为荣耀。埃及与推罗关系紧密、命运相似，是世人荣耀的顶峰，前四个国家还只是从外面讥笑、报复神的百姓，推罗和埃及却是从里面诱惑百姓跟随、吸引他们投靠，使他们的心偏邪。因此，神要特别对付他们，向推罗、西顿两次宣告「我必与你为敌」（二十六3；二十八22），又向埃及三次宣告与法老为敌（二十九3、10；三十22）。神审判前四个国家只用了17节（二十五章），审判推罗西顿却用了83节（二十六-二十八章），审判埃及更用了97节（二十九-三十二章）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「海中的群岛见你归于无有就都惊惶」（18节），指推罗的灭亡将会连累倚靠贸易的地中海各国，从而看到神对自己的警告。因此，他们聚集在一起，在昔日贸易霸主的尸体旁边发抖，为她作起哀歌（17-18节）、举行葬礼，哀叹自己因推罗得好处、也因推罗而遭殃。今天，凡是倚靠大巴比伦的世界经济体系生存的人，也必将因大巴比伦的倾倒而「惊惶」，所以圣灵提醒我们：「我的民哪，你们要从那城出来，免得与她一同有罪，受她所受的灾殃」（启十八4）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

神的追讨总是这样：越是被人看重的，越会首先失去；越是引以为豪的，越要首先沉没。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":295,"href":"/docs/Devotional_commentary_bible/026_Ezekiel/Ezekiel_29/","title":"29

Vaccine），只能提醒人、不能诱惑人。自从被波斯帝国征服之后，埃及再也没有恢复从前的权势和荣耀，而是成为历代列强的附庸。埃及在政治上的降卑，将持续作为神百姓的反面教材——每当犹大看见埃及的时候，就会想起自己倚靠人、不信靠神的愚昧；每当我们看见埃及的时候，也当反省自己的心中有没有一条狂傲肥壮的鳄鱼，盘踞在应该留给神的地位上。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

埃及和亚述的「罪恶」（11节）一样，都是「心骄气傲」（10节）。香柏树的高大并不是罪，但「因它高大，树尖插入云中，心骄气傲」（10节），甚至忘了是「众水使它生长；深水使它长大」（4节），所以就成了罪。「败坏之先，人心骄傲」（箴十八12），这也是推罗（二十八2）和巴别（创十一4）的败坏模式，结果就是被神驱逐（11节；二十八16），好像亚当夏娃被神逐出伊甸园一样（创三24）。\n古往今来，死亡都是医治骄傲最有效的方法。无论亚述和埃及怎样目中无神，最终都会在死亡这个老师面前做一个乖乖的学生——「被交与死亡，到阴府去了」（14节）。无论今天的世人怎样高举自己，最终都会在死亡面前仰望星空、反省内心。 埃及和亚述都像这棵香柏树，因为神所安排的环境得天独厚，所以高大荣美到一个地步（3-5节），势力大大扩张，几乎可以荫庇众生（6节）、风头盖过了伊甸园（7-9节），「以致神伊甸园中的树都嫉妒它」（9节），自己也因此「心骄气傲」（10节），忘了是神「使它的枝条蕃多，成为荣美」（9节）。骄傲就像无孔不入的蛀虫，一旦人忘记自己是谁、忘记恩典的源头，就像在成功里面埋进了一粒虫卵，最终会蛀空每一棵参天大树。在历史上，许多国家都和亚述、埃及一样，一旦有所成就，就会自视过高，不是把自己看为进步的代表、就是把自己当作人类的未来，试图在地上建立天国、取代神的伊甸园。但最终的结果也都是「与伊甸的诸树一同下到阴府」（18节），因为「这是主耶和华说的」（18节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

我必给你们加上筋、使你们长肉、又将皮遮蔽你们、使气息进入你们里面、你们就要活了。你们便知道我是耶和华。\n37:7 于是我遵命说预言。正说预言的时候、不料、有响声、有地震。骨与骨互相联络。\n37:8 我观看、见骸骨上有筋、也长了肉、又有皮遮蔽其上。只是还没有气息。\n37:9 主对我说、人子阿、你要发预言、向风发预言、说、主耶和华如此说、气息阿、要从四方〔原文作风〕而来、吹在这些被杀的人身上、使他们活了。\n37:10 于是我遵命说预言、气息就进入骸骨、骸骨便活了、并且站起来、成为极大的军队。1\n37:11 主对我说、人子阿、这些骸骨就是以色列全家。他们说、我们的骨头枯干了、我们的指望失去了、我们灭绝净尽了。\n37:12 所以你要发预言、对他们说、主耶和华如此说、我的民哪、我必开你们的坟墓、使你们从坟墓中出来、领你们进入以色列地。\n37:13 我的民哪、我开你们的坟墓、使你们从坟墓中出来、你们就知道我是耶和华。\n37:14 我必将我的灵放在你们里面、你们就要活了。我将你们安置在本地、你们就知道我耶和华如此说、也如此成就了。这是耶和华说的。\n37:15 耶和华的话又临到我说、\n37:16 人子阿、你要取一根木杖、在其上写、为犹大和他的同伴以色列人。又取一根木杖、在其上写、为约瑟、就是为以法莲、又为他的同伴以色列全家。\n37:17 你要使这两根木杖接连为一、在你手中成为一根。\n37:18 你本国的子民问你说、这是甚么意思、你不指示我们么。\n37:19 你就对他们说、主耶和华如此说、我要将约瑟和他同伴以色列支派的杖、就是那在以法莲手中的、与犹大的杖一同接连为一、在我手中成为一根。\n37:20 你所写的那两根杖、要在他们眼前拿在手中。\n37:21 要对他们说、主耶和华如此说、我要将以色列人从他们所到的各国收取、又从四围聚集他们、引导他们归回本地。\n37:22 我要使他们在那地、在以色列山上、成为一国、有一王作他们众民的王。他们不再为二国、决不再分为二国。\n37:23 也不再因偶像、和可憎的物、并一切的罪过、玷污自己。我却要救他们出离一切的住处、就是他们犯罪的地方。我要洁净他们。如此、他们要作我的子民、我要作他们的　神。\n37:24 我的仆人大卫、必作他们的王。众民必归一个牧人。他们必顺从我的典章、谨守遵行我的律例。\n37:25 他们必住在我赐给我仆人雅各的地上、就是你们列祖所住之地。他们和他们的子孙、并子孙的子孙、都永远住在那里。我的仆人大卫、必作他们的王、直到永远。\n37:26 并且我要与他们立平安的约、作为永约。我也要将他们安置在本地、使他们的人数增多、又在他们中间设立我的圣所、直到永远。 (2)\n37:27 我的居所必在他们中间。我要作他们的　神、他们要作我的子民。\n37:28 我的圣所在以色列人中间、直到永远、外邦人就必知道我是叫以色列成为圣的耶和华。 (3)\n  当先知发表预言的时候，枯骨复活了，整个过程分为两个阶段：\n第一次是「向这些骸骨发预言」（4节），「骨与骨互相联络」（7节）、变成躯体，「只是还没有气息」（8节），仍然是死的。这就像讲道，传道人面对没有生命的枯骨、劝勉它们听从神的话，但效果却非常有限：骸骨确实能变成躯体，但却仍然是死的。\n第二次是「向风发预言」（9节），「气息就进入骸骨，骸骨便活了」（9节）。这就像祷告，传道人呼吁圣灵做工、施行新造的神迹（创二7）。讲道不能达成的目的，祷告却能使之成为事实。没有生命的躯体不但复活了，「并且站起来，成为极大的军队」（10节）。但这支军队的目的却不是争战、而是回家（12节），就像出埃及时「耶和华的军队」（出十二41）。 在骸骨复活的整个过程中，以西结只是在「遵命说预言」（7、10节）。因为以色列的复兴，从开始到末了都是神的工作。人唯一能做的，就是顺服神的带领、发表神的话语。在任何属灵的复兴当中，人所能做的也只是如此。任何人为的努力、技巧和方法，最多只能带来虚假的兴奋、制造没有气息的躯体。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 「我要与他们立平安的约，作为永约」（26节），也就是新约（三十四25；耶三十一31），这是神「应许大卫那可靠的恩典」（赛五十五3），要「在基督里，叫世人与自己和好」（林后五19）、恢复正常的关系。因此，以色列的复兴要等到以色列全家都进入新约，才能完全成就。这个工作将由基督自己完成，所谓「把福音传回耶路撒冷」的运动，并没有圣经的根据；事实上，无论是罗马帝国、阿拉伯帝国、奥斯曼帝国，还是以色列复国以后，教会和福音从来都没有离开过耶路撒冷。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神复兴以色列全家的目的，是要把他们恢复成「祭司的国度」 （出十九6），让祂的「圣所在以色列人中间直到永远」（28节；四十八35），让祂的见证永远显明在以色列中，好让外邦人认识祂是「叫以色列成为圣的耶和华」（28节），也就是「耶和华玛卡代西 Yahweh Maccaddeschcem」（出三十一13）。\n我们所当做的，既不是断言教会已经取代以色列（罗十一18），也不必臆测以色列何时复兴（徒一6），更不能致力于建立地上的冒牌天国，而是和先知一样「遵命说预言」（7、10节），专心宣讲「天国近了，你们应当悔改」（太四17），诚实倚靠圣灵，「叫神在凡事上因耶稣基督得荣耀」（彼前四11）。 以西结书第37章逐节注解、祷读 ‪彼得前书‬2:9 和合本 9

我要在我民以色列中显出我的圣名。 也不容我的圣名再被亵渎。列国人就知道我是耶和华以色列中的圣者。\n39:8 主耶和华说、这日事情临近、也必成就、乃是我所说的日子。\n39:9 住以色列城邑的人必出去捡器械、就是大小盾牌、弓箭、梃杖、枪矛、都当柴烧火、直烧七年。\n39:10 甚至他们不必从田野捡柴、也不必从树林伐木。 因为他们要用器械烧火。 并且抢夺那抢夺他们的人、掳掠那掳掠他们的人。 这是主耶和华说的。\n39:11 当那日我必将以色列地的谷、就是海东人所经过的谷、赐给歌革为坟地、使经过的人到此停步。在那里人必葬埋歌革和他的群众、就称那地为哈们歌革谷。\n39:12 以色列家的人、必用七个月葬埋他们、为要洁净全地。\n39:13 全地的居民都必葬埋他们。当我得荣耀的日子、这事必叫他们得名声。这是主耶和华说的。\n39:14 他们必分派人时常巡查遍地、与过路的人一同葬埋那剩在地面上的尸首、好洁净全地。 过了七个月、他们还要巡查。\n39:15 巡查遍地的人、要经过全地。见有人的骸骨、就在旁边立一标记、等葬埋的人来将骸骨葬在哈们歌革谷。1\n39:16 他们必这样洁净那地。 并有一城名叫哈摩那。\n39:17 人子阿、主耶和华如此说、你要对各类的飞鸟、和田野的走兽说、你们聚集来吧。 要从四方聚到我为你们献祭之地、就是在以色列山上献大祭之地、好叫你们吃肉喝血。\n39:18 你们必吃勇士的肉、喝地上首领的血、就如吃公绵羊、羊羔、公山羊、公牛、都是巴珊的肥畜。\n39:19 你们吃我为你们所献的祭、必吃饱了脂油、喝醉了血。\n39:20 你们必在我席上饱吃马匹和坐车的人、并勇士和一切的战士。 这是主耶和华说的。\n39:21 我必显我的荣耀在列国中。 万民就必看见我所行的审判、与我在他们身上所加的手。\n39:22 这样、从那日以后以色列家必知道我是耶和华他们的　神。\n39:23 列国人也必知道以色列家被掳掠、是因他们的罪孽。他们得罪我、我就掩面不顾、将他们交在敌人手中、他们便都倒在刀下。\n39:24 我是照他们的污秽和罪过待他们。 并且我掩面不顾他们。\n39:25 主耶和华如此说、我要使雅各被掳的人归回、要怜悯以色列全家、又为我的圣名发热心。\n39:26 他们在本地安然居住、无人惊吓、是我将他们从万民中领回、从仇敌之地召来。我在许多国的民眼前、在他们身上显为圣的时候、他们要担当自己的羞辱、和干犯我的一切罪。\n39:27 见上节 39:28 因我使他们被掳到外邦人中、后又聚集他们归回本地、他们就知道我是耶和华他们的　神。我必不再留他们一人在外邦。\n39:29 我也不再掩面不顾他们、因我已将我的灵浇灌以色列家。这是主耶和华说的。\n  歌革之战，表明国度的复兴不只是让枯骨得生命（三十七10），而且要「得的更丰盛」（约十10）。因此，神不但要带领百姓第二次出埃及（25-29节），也要让他们第二次过红海（出十四13-18）、真正进入安息，从「安然居住」（三十八8、11、14）进一步变为「安然居住，无人惊吓」（26 节）。这既是好牧人的工作结果（三十四28），也是圣约的祝福应许（利二十六5-6）。 今天，神已经将圣灵浇灌在每一个信徒里面，我们已经在大牧者基督的看顾下「安然居住」（三十四27）。但是，我们也像「没有城墙，无门、无闩」的以色列一样，外表安静、心里打鼓，常常被环境惊吓，看不到神是我们「四围的火城」（亚二5）、也看不到「与我们同在的比与他们同在的更多」（王下六17）。而世界也像歌革一样，常常把我们的和平忍让当作软弱可欺（太五38-48），甚至我们自己也常备感窝囊。因此，神也不需要我们硬着头皮、冒充刚强，祂不但会激动法老来追赶我们（出十四4）、也会领着歌革「从北方的极处上来」（2节），然后亲自为我们争战，「在法老和他全军身上得荣耀」（出十四4），也向列国彰显荣耀（21节）。当我们在歌革之战中经历神以后，才能真正体会神是我们的神（22节），因此信心产生飞跃，从此越来越能放下血气的手（撒下六6），不再被肉体惹动、不再被环境摸着、也不再被仇敌惊吓，而是进入基督里面「安然居住，无人惊吓」（26节；三十四28）的安息！\n今天，我们都「好像基督耶稣的精兵」（提后二3），但却不是我们为主争战，而是主为我们争战。人应当警醒守望（三十三章），但负责争战的是神自己（三十八-三十九章）；教会这支「极大的军队」，只是为了打扫战场。无论是事奉传道、还是属灵争战，都是因为我们主「已经胜了世界」（约十六33）、「掳掠了仇敌」（弗四8），我们只是凭着信心收拾战利品——「因为凡从神生的，就胜过世界；使我们胜了世界的，就是我们的信心」（约壹五4）。\n以西结书第39章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

现在他们当从我面前远除邪淫、和他们君王的尸首。我就住在他们中间直到永远。\n43:10 人子阿、你要将这殿指示以色列家、使他们因自己的罪孽惭愧。也要他们量殿的尺寸。2\n43:11 他们若因自己所行的一切事惭愧、你就将殿的规模、样式、出入之处、和一切形状、典章、礼仪、法则指示他们、在他们眼前写上、使他们遵照殿的一切规模典章去作。\n43:12 殿的法则、乃是如此。殿在山顶上、四围的全界、要称为至圣。这就是殿的法则。3\n43:13 以下量祭坛、是以肘为度。（这肘是一肘零一掌)底座高一肘、边宽一肘、四围起边高一掌。这是坛的座。\n43:14 从底座到下层磴台、高二肘、边宽一肘、从小磴台到大磴台、高四肘、边宽一肘。\n43:15 坛上的供台、高四肘。供台的四拐角上、都有角。\n43:16 供台、长十二肘、宽十二肘、四面见方。\n43:17 磴台长十四肘、宽十四肘、四面见方。四围起边高半肘。底座四围的边、宽一肘。台阶朝东。\n43:18 他对我说、人子阿、主耶和华如此说、建造祭坛、为要在其上献燔祭洒血、造成的时候典章如下。\n43:19 主耶和华说、你要将一只公牛犊作为赎罪祭、给祭司利未人撒督的后裔、就是那亲近我事奉我的。\n43:20 你要取些公牛的血、抹在坛的四角、和磴台的四拐角、并四围所起的边上。你这样洁净坛、坛就洁净了。\n43:21 你又要将那作赎罪祭的公牛犊烧在殿外、圣地之外预定之处。\n43:22 次日、要将无残疾的公山羊献为赎罪祭。要洁净坛、像用公牛犊洁净的一样。\n43:23 洁净了坛、就要将一只无残疾的公牛犊、和羊群中一只无残疾的公绵羊、 43:24

今天，我们的难处常常也是圣俗「仅隔一墙」——明明是体贴肉体、贪图方便，却大言不惭地自诩有「心灵和诚实」（约四23）；明明是不肯付上代价、分别为圣，却自欺欺人地以为是不拘泥形式。但神从来都不会悦纳圣俗「仅隔一墙」的敬拜和祷告——「岂不知你们的身子就是圣灵的殿吗」（林前六19）？神所乐意居住的殿，必须「四围有墙，长五百肘，宽五百肘，为要分别圣地与俗地」（四十二20）；而我们心中的圣殿，敬拜和祷告的祭坛离闲聊、琐事和各种杂念之间的距离，到底隔了多少肘呢？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 神吩咐先知「将这殿指示以色列家」（10节），并不是叫百姓照着去建造，而是让他们看到神所建造的圣殿以后，就「因自己的罪孽惭愧」（11节），痛悔自己过去没有照着神的心意分别为圣；同时「也要他们量殿的尺寸。」（10节），用心领会什么是分别为圣。\n百姓「若因自己所行的一切事惭愧」（11节），接下来就应当照着分别为圣的原则、「遵照殿的一切规模典章去做」（11节），按照「殿的法则」（12节）来事奉神。只有这样，神才会「在这里住，在以色列人中直到永远」（7节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 12节可译为「这是殿的律法：山顶上四周围的全地界都称为至圣；看哪，这就是殿的律法」（和合本修订版，英文ESV译本）。神不但要求「分别圣地与俗地」（四十二20），圣俗不能「仅隔一墙」（8节），而且要求「山顶上四周围的全地界都称为至圣」。 [^]: 13-27节是第一个分别为圣的措施：洁净祭坛的仪式。\n在会幕里，至圣的物都代表基督，能使「凡挨着的都成为圣」出三十29）。祭坛是至圣的，「凡挨着坛的都成为圣」（出二十九37；太二十三19）。因此，祭坛代表基督、而不是十字架；因为十字架并不能使人成圣，惟有基督才能使人成为圣。\n「供台的四拐角上都有角」（15节），用来涂抹祭牲的血（四十三20；出二十九12），也是寻求庇护的地方（王上一50；二28）。\n会幕中的祭坛是皂荚木外面包着铜，「长五肘，宽五肘，高三肘」（出二十七1）。所罗门圣殿的铜祭坛「长二十肘，宽二十肘，高十肘」（代下四1）。国度的祭坛底座长宽各十八肘，供台长宽各十二肘，四层总高度十一肘，但却没有提到材料是铜，表明这个祭坛的功用不再是象征审判。\n「台阶朝东」（17节），这样祭司献祭时背向太阳、面向圣殿，与外邦人敬拜太阳的方向相反。这个台阶只是上到「磴台」（17节），并没有上到「供台」，所以符合律法的要求：「你上我的坛，不可用台阶，免得露出你的下体来」（出二十26）。\n磴台「四围起边高半肘，底座四围的边宽一肘」（17节），这样，祭司离祭坛还差三肘半，也就是一米八二，负责放祭物的祭司即使身材高大，也需要将祭物和木柴高高举起，很不容易操作。而供台的面积只有所罗门祭坛的36%，体积只有所罗门祭坛的14.4%，并不能焚烧很多祭物。这些都表明，国度里的祭坛最重要的功用不是献祭，而是记念。国度的祭坛和会幕、所罗门圣殿里的祭坛一样，都要通过洁净之礼成为至圣，用以象征基督。但结构更新了、功用也变了，不再是为了预表基督在十字架上的降卑，而是为了记念基督借着十字架的高升。\n18-27节是七日洁净祭坛、分别为圣的仪式。\n「建造祭坛，为要在其上献燔祭洒血，造成的时候典章如下」（18节），可译为「这些是建造祭坛，为要在其上献燔祭，把血洒在上面的条例」（和合本修订版，英文ESV译本）。\n进入国度以后，主耶稣已经「一次献祭，便叫那得以成圣的人永远完全」（来十14）。因此，国度里献祭的意义与旧约时代不同，不再是预表把基督钉十字架，而是为了记念主耶稣已经将自己献作「更美的祭物」（来十12），也提醒人永远都需要支取基督的救赎（约壹一7-10）。正如教会的圣餐，目的是为了「表明主的死」（林前十一26）、记念祂已经成就的救恩。\n正如摩西「要洁净坛七天，使坛成圣，坛就成为至圣。凡挨着坛的都成为圣」（出二十九37），所罗门要「行奉献坛的礼七日」（代下七9），国度的圣殿里也需要举行七日洁净祭坛的仪式，才能「把坛分别为圣」（25节）。而祭司以西结竟然在即将退休的年龄，蒙神拣选执行这样一件荣耀的事奉：\n第一日，用一只公牛犊作赎罪祭（19节），洒血洁净祭坛（20节；出二十九16），祭牲要烧在圣地之外（21节；利四12、21；八17；九11；十六27；来十三11-13）。洒血是立约的记号（出二十四6）。「耶稣要用自己的血叫百姓成圣」（来十三12），我们心中的祭坛若是没有用血洁净，所敬拜的只是臆想的偶像，所祈求的总是自己的私欲。\n第二至七日，用公山羊代替公牛犊作赎罪祭、洁净坛（22节），同时献上一只公牛犊和一只公绵羊作为燔祭（23-24节）。燔祭并不需要撒盐，只有在素祭才需要（利二13），但此时祭司却「要撒盐在其上」（24节），代表这燔祭是永远不变的「盐约」（民十八19；代下十三5）。\n与会幕不同，国度的祭坛并不需要「用膏抹坛，使坛成圣」（出二十九36），而是只用血来洁净坛（20节；利八15）。因为基督已经被圣灵膏抹（太三16），不需要另外再用膏油膏抹（利八11）。\n第八日以后，祭坛才能成为「叫礼物成圣的坛」（太二十三19），可以用来献上「燔祭和平安祭」（27节），神才会「悦纳」（27节）这两种祭所代表的全然奉献和感谢交通。\n这个仪式的目的并不是为了洁净祭司，而是为了洁净祭坛、使物质的祭坛成为属灵的象征，可以代表人与神之间唯一的中保基督、成为整个圣地的中心。并不是所有叫祭坛的地方，都可以让我们接近神。我们也只有在神面前反复思想赎罪祭和燔祭的实际，在心中施行严肃的洁净礼，才能让我们心中的祭坛成为至圣，让我们靠着基督来到神面前。\n以西结书第43章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

耶和华对我说、人子阿、我对你所说耶和华殿中的一切典章法则、你要放在心上、用眼看、用耳听、并要留心殿宇、和圣地一切出入之处。\n44:6 你要对那悖逆的以色列家说、主耶和华如此说、以色列家阿、你们行一切可憎的事、当够了吧。\n44:7 你们把我的食物、就是脂油和血献上的时候、将身心未受割礼的外邦人、领进我的圣地、玷污了我的殿。又背了我的约、在你们一切可憎的事上、加上这一层。\n44:8 你们也没有看守我的圣物、却派别人在圣地替你们看守我所吩咐你们的。\n44:9 主耶和华如此说、以色列中的外邦人、就是身心未受割礼的、都不可入我的圣地。 (2)\n44:10 当以色列人走迷的时候、有利未人远离我、就是走迷离开我随从他们的偶像、他们必担当自己的罪孽。\n44:11 然而他们必在我的圣地当仆役、照管殿门、在殿中供职。必为民宰杀燔祭牲、和平安祭牲、必站在民前伺候他们。\n44:12 因为这些利未人曾在偶像前伺候这民、成了以色列家罪孽的绊脚石。所以我向他们起誓、他们必担当自己的罪孽。这是主耶和华说的。\n44:13 他们不可亲近我、给我供祭司的职分、也不可挨近我的一件圣物、就是至圣的物。他们却要担当自己的羞辱、和所行可憎之事的报应。\n44:14 然而我要使他们看守殿宇、办理其中的一切事、并作其内一切当作之工。 (3)\n44:15 以色列人走迷离开我的时候、祭司利未人撒督的子孙、仍看守我的圣所。他们必亲近我、事奉我、并且侍立在我面前、将脂油与血献给我。这是主耶和华说的。\n44:16 他们必进入我的圣所、就近我的桌前事奉我、守我所吩咐的。\n44:17 他们进内院门、必穿细麻衣。在内院门和殿内供职的时候、不可穿羊毛衣服。\n44:18 他们头上要戴细麻布裹头巾、腰穿细麻布裤子。不可穿使身体出汗的衣服。\n44:19 他们出到外院的民那里、当脱下供职的衣服、放在圣屋内、穿上别的衣服、免得因圣衣使民成圣。\n44:20 不可剃头、也不可容发绺长长、只可剪发。\n44:21 祭司进内院的时候、都不可喝酒。\n44:22 不可娶寡妇和被休的妇人为妻。只可娶以色列后裔中的处女、或是祭司遗留的寡妇。\n44:23 他们要使我的民知道圣俗的分别、又使他们分辨洁净的和不洁净的。\n44:24 有争讼的事、他们应当站立判断。要按我的典章判断。在我一切的节期必守我的律法、条例。也必以我的安息日为圣日。\n44:25 他们不可挨近死尸沾染自己。只可为父亲、母亲、儿子、女儿、弟兄、和未嫁人的姐妹、沾染自己。\n44:26 祭司洁净之后、必再计算七日。\n44:27 当他进内院、进圣所、在圣所中事奉的日子、要为自己献赎罪祭。这是主耶和华说的。 (4)\n44:28 祭司必有产业。我是他们的产业。不可在以色列中给他们基业。我是他们的基业。\n44:29 素祭、赎罪祭、和赎愆祭、他们都可以吃。以色列中一切永献的物、都要归他们。\n44:30 首先初熟之物、和一切所献的供物、都要归给祭司。你们也要用初熟的麦子磨面给祭司。这样、福气就必临到你们的家了。\n44:31 无论是鸟、是兽、凡自死的、或是撕裂的、祭司都不可吃。 (5)\n  1-3节是第二个分别为圣的措施：东门要永远关闭。\n「圣地朝东的外门」（1节），指外院的东门。\n当神的荣光从东门进入圣殿之后（2节；四十三4），外院的东门就「必须关闭，不可敞开，谁也不可由其中进入」（2节），以免被玷污。百姓只能从北门和南门进入外院，目的就是分别为圣。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 4-9节是第三个分别为圣的措施：出入圣地的法则。\n以西结从内院的北门来到殿前（四十六1），再一次与神的荣耀相遇。这一次，神宣告：只有内心顺服神的人，才是真正与神立约的百姓，才能进入祂的圣地（9节；诗十五1-5；二十四3-6）。\n神用「割礼」（7节）作为与亚伯拉罕和他后裔「立约的证据」（创十七11），表明人与犯罪的旧生命隔绝，单单信靠神、「不靠着肉体」（腓三3）。以色列男孩在出生后第八天行割礼（利十二3）。\n「将身心未受割礼的外邦人领进我的圣地，玷污了我的殿」（7节），包括耶何耶大把外邦雇佣兵迦利人带进圣殿（王下十一4）。在国度的圣殿里，「四围的全界要称为至圣」（四十三12），进入圣地的人将自动分别为圣归给神。而归给神只有两种可能：一种是甘心顺服，「将身体献上，当作活祭」（罗十二1）；另一种是拒绝顺服，被神「尽行毁灭」（民二十一2）。\n「一切受过割礼、心却未受割礼的」（耶九25），指那些身体行过割礼、心却没有归给神的人，他们并没有敬畏神、顺服圣约的实际，心里并没有「立约的证据」（创十七11；耶三十一33）、没有「肉心」（结十一19）。\n在千年国度里，还有一些「身心未受割礼的外邦人」（7节），他们还没有「将心里的污秽除掉」（耶四4；申十16；三十6），并不是「新造的人」（加六15）。当「那一千年完了，撒但必从监牢里被释放，出来要迷惑地上四方的列国」（启二十7-8），这些人就成了被迷惑的对象。\n神在开始启示国度圣殿的事奉之前，首先提醒百姓的失败：「你们也没有看守我的圣物，却派别人在圣地替你们看守我所吩咐你们的」（8节）。今天，每个信徒都是「有君尊的祭司」（彼前二9），但有些人也常常推卸责任，只做爱做的事情，雇佣各种「属灵的专业人士」替我们看守当看守的；有些人也常常不问生命，只凭外貌和能力，就把「身心未受割礼的外邦人」请上讲台。\n神从来都不担心事奉祂的人会疲劳过度，反而责备他们缺乏对神真实的爱， 体贴肉体、敷衍了事，变着花样地偷懒。「因为我们是与神同工的」（林前三9），工作的主人是神，凡是神要我们做的工作，都是祂在背负重担、绝对不会让人过劳。人的问题并不是为主付出太多，而是不肯顺服；并不是神的工作太多，而是心中杂草丛生。当一个事奉的人身心疲惫、无法安息的时候，就应当立刻放下重担、求主鉴察：我们肩上所负的是主的轭，还是自己的重担呢（太十一30）？我们事奉的是神，还是自己的事业心、成就感、攀比欲和其它各种偶像呢？\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 10-14节是第四个分别为圣的措施：祭司资格的法则。\n「当以色列人走迷的时候」（10节），有些担任祭司的利未人不但没有站对位置、用律法教导百姓，反而跟着走迷的人走迷，「随从他们的偶像」（10节）。所以「他们必担当自己的罪孽」（10节），不可再「供祭司的职分」（13节），只能在圣地「当仆役，照管殿门，在殿中供职」（11节）。\n「因为这些利未人曾在偶像前伺候这民，成了以色列家罪孽的绊脚石」（12节），所以即使他们已经悔改，神的恩典也只是安排他们在人和殿面前事奉（11、14节），但却没有资格继续在神面前事奉（13节）。神是「有怜悯有恩典的神」（出三十四6），也是「忌邪的神」（出二十5）；但在人本主义的时代，有些人却似乎比神更有恩典怜悯，以致犯罪的牧师只要避过风头，就可以东山再起，甚至被捧为「浪子回头」。其实这些人并不是敬拜神，而是在敬拜偶像；这些牧师并不是事奉神，反而更要「担当自己的羞辱和所行可憎之事的报应」（13节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 15-27节是第五个分别为圣的措施：祭司要分别为圣。\n在国度里，曾经迷失的祭司只能在殿和人面前事奉（11、14节），只有忠心到底的祭司才能在神面前事奉（15-16节）。\n「撒督的子孙」（15节）忠心站立在自己的位置上，神就允许他们在国度里「亲近我，事奉我」（15节），直接事奉神。「撒督」是亚伦的孙子非尼哈的后裔（代上六50-53），在大卫的时代和所罗门的时代都忠心担任大祭司（撒下八17；十五24-29；王上二35），他的后裔在第一圣殿和第二圣殿一直担任大祭司，直到主前171年的希腊化时代，安提阿哥四世（Antiochus IV Epiphanes，主前175-164年在位 ）将大祭司的职分转授与便雅悯人门尼老斯（Menelaus，主前172-161年在位），从此政治势力开始干预属灵事务（《犹太古史记》卷20第10章235、249节）。\n律法规定，大祭司不可娶寡妇，「只可娶本民中的处女为妻」（利二十一14），但国度里的祭司却可以娶「祭司遗留的寡妇」（22节），表明他们都不是大祭司。因为已经有基督「照着麦基洗德的等次成了永远的大祭司」（来六20）。\n在神面前事奉的祭司必须分别为圣，包括：\n服装分别为圣（17-19节）：祭司「进内院门必穿细麻衣」（17节；出三十九29-29；利六10；十六4），事奉时「不可穿羊毛衣服」（17节）。这不是根据衣料的贵贱，而是因为「不可穿使身体出汗的衣服」（18节），以免不洁净。「免得因圣衣使民成圣」（19节），是因为供职的衣服都是至圣的，至圣的物品会使「凡挨着的都成为圣」（出三十29；二十九37）。普通百姓若是接触了这些圣衣，就必须把自己赎出来（利二十七1-8），否则就要归神所有。\n生活分别为圣（20-27节）：用他们日常生活中的发型（20节）、吃喝（21节）、婚姻（22节）、丧事（25-27节）来使百姓「知道圣俗的分别，又使他们分辨洁净的和不洁净的」（23节），作为百姓学习分别圣俗、遵行律法的榜样（24节）。\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 28-31节是第六个分别为圣的措施：祭司凭信心生活。\n祭司的产业不是土地，而是神自己（28节）。他们不需要有自己的土地，而是享用祭物（29-30节），完全仰望神的供应。\n「无论是鸟是兽，凡自死的，或是撕裂的，祭司都不可吃」（31节），虽然这个禁令适用于所有的以色列人（利七24），但对祭司的挑战更大：因为即使百姓减少奉献、祭物不够生活，祭司也照样不能吃这些不洁净的食物。真正凭信心生活的人，既「知道怎样处卑贱，也知道怎样处丰富；或饱足，或饥饿；或有余，或缺乏，随事随在」（腓四12），都能倚靠那加给我们力量的。因此，「虽然无花果树不发旺，葡萄树不结果，橄榄树也不效力，田地不出粮食，圈中绝了羊，棚内也没有牛；然而，我要因耶和华欢欣，因救我的神喜乐」（哈三17-18）。\n以西结书第44章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

主耶和华如此说、以色列的王阿、你们应当知足。要除掉强暴和抢夺的事、施行公平和公义、不再勒索我的民。这是主耶和华说的。\n45:10 你们要用公道天平、公道伊法、公道罢特。\n45:11 伊法与罢特、大小要一样。罢特可盛贺梅珥十分之一、伊法也可盛贺梅珥十分之一、都以贺梅珥的大小为准。\n45:12 舍客勒是二十季拉。二十舍客勒、二十五舍客勒、十五舍客勒、为你们的弥那。\n45:13

王的本分、是在节期、月朔、安息日、就是以色列家一切的节期、奉上燔祭、素祭、奠祭。他要预备赎罪祭、素祭、燔祭、和平安祭、为以色列家赎罪。\n45:18 主耶和华如此说、正月初一日、你要取无残疾的公牛犊、洁净圣所。\n45:19 祭司要取些赎罪祭牲的血、抹在殿的门柱上、和坛磴台的四角上、并内院的门框上。\n45:20 本月初七日、〔七十经作七月初一日〕也要为误犯罪的、和愚蒙犯罪的如此行。为殿赎罪。\n45:21 正月十四日、你们要守逾越节、守节七日。要吃无酵饼。\n45:22 当日王要为自己和国内的众民、预备一只公牛作赎罪祭。\n45:23 这节的七日、每日他要为耶和华预备无残疾的公牛七只、公绵羊七只为燔祭。每日又要预备公山羊一只为赎罪祭。\n45:24 他也要预备素祭、就是为一只公牛同献一伊法细面、为一只公绵羊同献一伊法细面。每一伊法细面加油一欣。\n45:25 七月十五日、守节的时候、七日他都要如此行、照逾越节的赎罪祭、燔祭、素祭、和油的条例一样。\n  1-6节是第七个分别为圣的措施：房屋要分别为圣。\n在国度里「拈阄分地为业」（1节），与第一次进迦南分地最大的差别，是首先「要献上一分给耶和华为圣供地」（1节），利未人（5节）、耶路撒冷城（6节）和王（7-8节）的地业也因此而确定。\n「圣供地」（1节）东西「长二万五千肘」（1节），南北「宽一万肘」（1节），大约是67.6平方公里，作为祭司的「房屋之地与圣所之圣地」（4节）。\n「圣所之地」（2节）是边长为五百肘的正方形，以外院的围墙为界（四十二20）。\n「郊野之地」（2节）环绕「圣所之地」四周，距离五十肘，将圣地与祭司的房屋分开。\n在国度里，利未人不再被分散在十二支派中，而是集中在圣殿附近，「归与在殿中供职的利未人」（5节）的利未人之地和祭司之地一样大。\n「作为二十间房屋之业」（5节），在七十士译本中是「作为他们居住的城镇的地业」。\n「属城的地业」（6节）只有祭司之地的一半大，「要归以色列全家」（6节），是专门给耶路撒冷城使用的土地。「其中的土产要作城内工人的食物。所有以色列支派中，在城内做工的，都要耕种这地」（四十八18-19），完全倚靠神的供应，而不是倚靠推罗所代表的世界经济和金融体系（二十六-二十八章）。\n以西结书第45章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

挨着以法莲的地界、从东到西、是流便的一分。\n48:7 挨着流便的地界、从东到西、是犹大的一分。\n48:8 挨着犹大的地界、从东到西、必有你们所当献的供地、宽二万五千肘。从东界到西界、长短与各分之地相同。圣地当在其中。\n48:9 你们献与耶和华的供地、要长二万五千肘、宽一万肘。\n48:10 这圣供地要归与祭司、北长二万五千肘、西宽一万肘、东宽一万肘、南长二万五千肘、耶和华的圣地、当在其中。\n48:11 这地要归与撒督的子孙中成为圣的祭司、就是那守我所吩咐的。当以色列人走迷的时候、他们不像那些利未人走迷了。\n48:12 这要归与他们为供地、是全地中至圣的。供地挨着利未人的地界。\n48:13 利未人所得的地、要长二万五千肘、宽一万肘、与祭司的地界相等、都长二万五千肘、宽一万肘。\n48:14 这地不可卖、不可换、初熟之物也不可归与别人、因为是归耶和华为圣的。\n48:15 这二万五千肘、前面所剩下五千肘宽之地、要作俗用、作为造城盖房郊野之地。城要在当中。\n48:16 城的尺寸乃是如此。北面四千五百肘、南面四千五百肘、东面四千五百肘、西面四千五百肘。\n48:17 城必有郊野、向北二百五十肘、向南二百五十肘、向东二百五十肘、向西二百五十肘。\n48:18 靠着圣供地的余地、东长一万肘、西长一万肘、要与圣供地相等。其中的土产、要作城内工人的食物。\n48:19 所有以色列支派中、在城内作工的、都要耕种这地。\n48:20 你们所献的圣供地、连归城之地、是四方的、长二万五千肘、宽二万五千肘。\n48:21 圣供地连归城之地、两边的余地要归与王。供地东边、南北二万五千肘、东至东界、西边南北二万五千肘西至西界、与各分之地相同。都要归王。圣供地和殿的圣地、要在其中。\n48:22 并且利未人之地、与归城之地的东西两边延长之地、（这两地在王地中间)就是在犹大和便雅悯两界中间、要归与王。\n48:23 论到其余的支派。从东到西、是便雅悯的一分。\n48:24

西面四千五百肘、有三门、一为迦得门、一为亚设门、一为拿弗他利门。\n48:35 城四围共一万八千肘。从此以后、这城的名字、必称为耶和华的所在。\n  1-7节是位于圣殿北方的七个支派，从北到南依次是：但、亚设、拿弗他利、玛拿西、以法莲、流便和犹大。其中离圣殿最近的是犹大支派（7节）。\n但支派放弃产业、偏行己路，自己跑到最北方，结果成了敬拜偶像的中心（书十九40-48；士十八27-31）、害人害己，神却在国度的最北方给他们分地为业。在国度里，即使是像但支派那样害人害己的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n亚设支派拥有肥沃的土地（创四十九20；申三十三24），却不肯为弟兄做些事情（士五17），也没有出过士师。但在国度里，即使是像亚设支派那样一无是处的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n拿弗他利支派没有珍惜机会、失去荣耀（士四6-9），结果被人藐视（赛九1）。但在国度里，即使是像拿弗他利支派那样错失机会的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n玛拿西支派一度英雄辈出（士六15；十一1），最后却首先被掳（王下十九29）。但在国度里，即使是像玛拿西支派那样灰心失落的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n以法莲支派曾经是北方十个支派的领袖（书十八1；士八1），蒙福最大（申三十三13-17），却带领百姓敬拜金牛犊（王上十二26-33），最后被神彻底弃掉、卑微不堪（诗七十八60、67）。但在国度里，即使是像以法莲支派那样彻底失败的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n流便支派原来是长子，结果却失去了长子的双份祝福（创四十九3-4）；他们曾经坚持留在约旦河东（民三十二16），最后却首先被掳（王下十九29）。但在国度里，即使是像流便支派那样自毁前途的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n犹大支派人才辈出、蒙神恩典最大，却也辜负神最多（十六47）。但在国度里，即使是像犹大支派那样辜负重托的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n23-29节是位于圣殿南方的五个支派，从北到南依次是：便雅悯、西缅、以萨迦、西布伦、迦得（23-29节）。其中离圣殿最近的是便雅悯支派（23节）。\n便雅悯支派是一个最英勇善战的支派（创四十九27；士二十16），却也因放纵肉体而几乎灭绝（士二十一6）。但在国度里，即使是像便雅悯支派那样困于肉体的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n西缅支派在十二支派中最缺乏存在感，他们在旷野犯罪、人口减少将近三分之二（民一23；二十五14；二十六14），连摩西都要为他们祈求不致人数稀少（申三十三6），第一次进迦南时只能在犹大支派中得产业（书十九9）。但在国度里，即使是像西缅支派那样被人忽视的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n以萨迦支派没有什么大错，也没有什么志向（创四十九14-15；申三十三18-19）。但在国度里，即使是像以萨迦支派那样胸无大志的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n西布伦支派占尽海陆优势（创四十九13；申三十三18-19），却懒得扩张境界（士一30），结果被人藐视（赛九1）。但在国度里，即使是像西布伦支派那样得过且过的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。\n迦得支派最先要求留在约旦河东（民三十二6），留恋肥美的牧场，却不肯帮助弟兄（士五17）。但在国度里，即使是像迦得支派那样贪图安逸的人，也能在基督里同得基业和安息。 分地为业，代表安息和供应。在国度里，以色列的十二支派无论多么失败、多么不配，将来都要回归，在基督里得着安息。但他们并不是回到原来的地业，而是全部重新安排；原来抢占河东肥美之地的两个半支派（民三十二1-5），也将被迁到河西。每片土地都是由东到西的长条形，彼此均分、井然有序，没有任何争议。人在恩典面前，只有真心承认自己不配，才能生发由衷的感恩；只有发自内心的感恩，才会带来顺服和安息。当百姓全然顺服和安息在基督里的时候，才能「在本地安然居住，无人惊吓」（三十九27），长久地享用神丰富的恩典和供应。\n以西结书第48章逐节注解、祷读\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n

魂的得救\n本卷书是讲论国度的福音：\n就是魂的得救，意志决定要跟从神，感情爱慕神，心思想念天上的事，献上自己当作活祭，一生向己死，向神活，千年国度中与基督一同作王。\n　灵的得救是一次永远的，不出任何代价。\n　魂的得救是一生漫长的客旅寄居的年日，需要天天奉献自己，背起自己的十字架来跟从主，甚至献上自己的性命。\n　体的得救是一瞬间，不出任何代价。\n彼得一生跟从主，最终倒钉十字架殉道而死，千年国度有荣耀的冠冕，与基督一同作王一千年。\n主耶稣基督是我们魂的牧人(彼前二25)，祂必使我们的灵魂体全然成圣。我们所负的责任是一生跟从祂。\n魂的得救有二十四项的实行：\n  [彼前一章1～5节]\n分别为圣，顺服神，重生的人，必能得着基督丰盛的生命，这个 基业永不朽坏，无玷污，不衰残，因着重生成为神的儿女，蒙神的能力保守，得着灵魂体全然成圣。\n  [彼前一6～7节]　在百般的试炼中，除去旧人，建造新人，信心增长，比金子更宝贵。十字架是除去旧人，建造新人的得胜道路。神是炼金之人的火。(玛三2)\n  [彼前一8～12节]\n信心不断增长，达到魂的得救，信心的根基是认识神的自己，基督为全人类死而复活，显明神是可信可靠的，神的儿女要传扬祂。\n  [彼前一13～16节]\n作顺命的神的儿女，单单属于主，单单事奉主，凡事上受神的管治，用神的真理约朿自己的心。耶稣基督是我们追求的目标。\n  [彼前一17节]\n敬畏神，一生过客旅寄居的祭坛帐棚生活，如同亚伯拉罕常筑祭坛，更新奉献，接受十字架，不立足于世界，盼望那更美的家乡。\n  [彼前一18～21节]\n认识基督的宝血，在创世立基时羔羊已经被杀了，羔羊的宝血永远洗净我们的罪，使我们的信心盼望在祂宝血的根基上，而不是在人的传统和金钱上。\n  [彼前一22～25节]\n顺从真理的道，主的话就是生命，就是灵，主的话是二刃的利剑分开我们的灵与魂。 主的话是活的在我们灵里生长，光照启示，洁净我们的心，使我们爱同一生命的弟兄，体，乃是彼此鼓励，舍己，爱主更深。 人的生命脆弱如同花草，若能一生为主而活，人生命里面的神的生命将存到永远。\n  [彼前二章1～3节]\n爱慕读圣经如同婴儿爱慕奶，纯净的灵奶是人直接读神的话，得着圣灵的开启，不是从人来的二手货。吃灵奶是生命长进的必要条件之一，对付罪的人读经亮光强。\n  [彼前二4～10节] 被神建造满有基督长成的身量，每块活石联于房角石基督。教会建造在基督盘石上，阴间的权势不能摇动她。 基督徒的身份是神所拣选的属天子民，是祭司把人带给神，是圣洁的国民单单属于神。基督徒的工作是传扬基督。\n  [彼前二11～12节]\n基督徒在世而出世，是天上的寄居者客旅，禁戒肉体的私欲方法是与基督联合。在外邦人中不同流合污，活出基督的生命，作光照亮人的黑暗，作盐渗透人心除去腐败的恶念，使人归向神。\n  [彼前二13～25节]\n基督徒是神的奴仆，在神的事上绝对顺服神，在上税纳粮的事上为了顺服主而顺服地上的君王，该撒的物归该撒，神的物归神，效法主耶稣付半舍克勒丁税。(太二十二21，十八27；罗十三章) 若触犯国家律法而受苦是无价值的，若为了顺服神而受政治世界逼迫就有份于基督的苦难，且有永远的价值。主基督留下的受苦脚踪是我们的道路，有无数的殉道者为了持定元首基督不屈从教皇，不拜君王，不把教会的主权交给任何人而流尽了最后一滴血。 因主钉死在十字架为我们死，因主受鞭伤医治了我们魔鬼所折磨的伤，祂的爱捆绑我们，使我们不得不为祂而活，为祂而死，我们蒙召就是为主受苦受死。祂是我们魂的牧人，拯救引领我们到底。\n  [彼前三章1～7节]\n家庭见证：妻子顺服丈夫，里面温柔安静与神同行，丈夫敬重妻子，基督是夫妻的头，如此行二人同心祷告就无拦阻。\n  [彼前三8～12节]\n肢体间彼此体恤，彼此同心，在一个灵一个魂里兴旺福音，各人看别人比自己强，尽力和睦，彼此包容，忍受肢体的逼迫。 彼此相爱联于元首基督，不是体贴人肉体乃是共同长进，交通舍己的道，不要求别人爱自己，乃要求自己爱别人。\n  [彼前三13～16节]\n对逼迫我们的外邦人为义受苦，与神无间隔，不是为罪受苦，等候神赐机会对外人传基督，使人归向主。\n  [彼前三章17节～四章6节]\n效法基督为义受苦，基督死而埋葬去他他拉深坑，对撒但宣告神的得胜。神容忍挪亚时代不信的人，终于洪水来临。 基督徒当有受苦的心志，这是征服罪恶的兵器，肉身受苦与罪断绝，脱离以往的罪友必受逼迫。神不使用一个安逸自私的人，一个追求神的人，无心再注重吃喝玩乐。\n  [彼前四章7～11节]\n儆醒祷告，谨慎自守约朿自己，等候主的再来，天天活在审判台的亮光中，106岁的西面 和84岁的亚拿昼夜祷告等候主的降世，等候催促主的再来的人是殷勤作工，恒切祷告的人。\n  [彼前四12～19]\n与基督一同受苦，接受神火炼的试验；为罪受苦是羞辱，为义受苦是荣耀，有永远的价值，审判先从神的教会开始，七支号审判不得胜者，七只碗审判外邦人。 基督徒「魂」的得救非常艰难，犯罪的基督徒审判是大的。\n  [彼前五章1～4节]\n作长老的是与基督同受苦，照神旨意带领信徒生命长进，并不是维持自己的势力范围，辖制羊群，不是勉强劳苦，乃是因爱主而甘心为羊群舍命。不是吃羊脂，穿羊毛，乃是作群羊的榜样，舍己背十字架，到主再来时必得荣耀的冠冕。\n  [彼前五5～6节]\n生命幼小的顺服生命长大的，当谦卑效法基督降卑至死。\n  [彼前五7～14节]\n坚固信心抵挡撒但，神手中的筛子撒但为洁净信徒，训练完成苦难除去。\n  [彼后一章1～11节]　生命建造八阶梯：\n从神来的信心，有能力，勇敢，供应德行。\n德行供应真知识经历神的话，神的话就是生命。\n生命供应节制，越顺服神越认识神，越受圣灵管治。\n节制供应忍耐，经历苦难产生忍耐。\n忍耐供应敬虔，因苦难受管教而虔诚敬畏主。\n虔敬供应爱弟兄，操练敬虔爱增加。\n爱弟兄供应爱众人，爱扩大能爱仇敌，因生命长进多结生命果子。\n  [彼后一12～21节]\n留意主的预言，儆醒早起的人见晨光，有吗哪，更多明白神的话。预言不照单段解释断章取义，乃综合圣经整体观念。\n  [彼后二章]\n历史的惊戒：防备假先知，假师傅的异端，生命幼小的人被异教之风摇动。神不宽容天使，打入无底坑成为撒但。 洪水灭亡挪亚时代的人，火焚烧罗得时代的所多玛人。每个败坏的时代总有敬虔的人蒙神保守，以利亞时代神存留七千人未曾拜巴力。 轻慢主治的人是爱宴乐，贪爱不义的工价，无生命供应的枯井，无生命根基的雾气，在黑暗中放纵情欲的人，被罪制伏，明知故犯的人，知道真理不愿出代价。\n  [彼后三章]　主迟延来的日子是祂看一日如千年的信实，千年如一日的忍耐，等候人人悔改。 神是烈火，当敬虔圣洁地事奉祂，对付罪恶，明白真道，等候催促祂的再来是竭力奔跑打仗的人。(提后四7～8)\n  有六个「宝贵」：\n 前书一章7节 试验过的信心比金子更宝贵，增加基督的份量 一19 基督的宝血 二4 基督是神宝贵的房角石，是建造教会惟一的标准 三4 妇女里面长久安静，温柔，神看为极宝贵 后书一章1节 宝贵的信心 一4 神赐给我们宝贵又极大的应许
